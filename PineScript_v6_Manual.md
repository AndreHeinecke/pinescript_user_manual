[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/Welcome to Pine Script™ v6

# [Welcome to Pine Script™ v6](https://www.tradingview.com#welcome-to-pine-script-v6)

Pine Script™ is [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)'s programming
language. It allows traders to create their own trading tools and run them on
our servers. We designed Pine Script™ as a lightweight, yet powerful, language
for developing indicators and strategies that you can then backtest. Most of
TradingView's built-in indicators are written in Pine Script™, and our thriving
community of Pine Script™ programmers has published more than 150,000 [Community Scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/), half of which are open-source.

# [Requirements](https://www.tradingview.com#requirements)

It's our explicit goal to keep Pine Script™ accessible and easy to understand
for the broadest possible audience. Pine Script™ is cloud-based and therefore
different from client-side programming languages. While we likely won't develop
Pine Script™ into a full-fledged language, we do constantly improve it and are
always happy to consider requests for new features.

Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must impose
limits in order to share these resources fairly among our users. We strive to
set as few limits as possible, but will of course have to implement as many as
needed for the platform to run smoothly. Limitations apply to the amount of data
requested from additional symbols, execution time, memory usage and script size.

# [First steps](https://www.tradingview.com#first-steps)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Welcome to the Pine Script™ [v6 User
Manual](#welcome),
which will accompany you in your journey to learn to program your own
trading tools in Pine Script™. Welcome also to the very active community
of Pine Script™ programmers on TradingView.

On this page, we present a step-by-step approach that you can follow to gradually become more familiar with indicators and strategies (also called *scripts*) written in the Pine Script™ programming language on [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/). We will get you started on your journey to:

1. **Use** some of the tens of thousands of existing scripts on the
   platform.
2. **Read** the Pine Script™ code of existing scripts.
3. **Write** Pine scripts.

If you are already familiar with the use of Pine scripts on TradingView and are now ready to learn how to write your own, then jump to the [Writing scripts](#writing-scripts) section of this page.

If you are new to our platform, then please read on!

## [Using scripts](https://www.tradingview.com#using-scripts)

If you are interested in using technical indicators or strategies on
TradingView, you can first start exploring the thousands of indicators
already available on our platform. You can access existing indicators on
the platform in two different ways:

- By using the chart's "Indicators, metrics, and strategies" button.
- By browsing TradingView's [Community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/), the largest repository of trading scripts in the world, with more than 150,000 scripts, half of which are free and *open-source*, which means you can see their Pine Script™ code.

If you can find the tools you need already written for you, it can be a
good way to get started and gradually become proficient as a script
user, until you are ready to start your programming journey in Pine
Script™.

### [Loading scripts from the chart](https://www.tradingview.com#loading-scripts-from-the-chart)

To explore and load scripts from your chart, click the "Indicators, metrics, and strategies" button, or use the forward slash `/` keyboard shortcut:

![image](images/First-steps-Using-scripts-Loading-scripts-from-the-chart-1.DPgTHVlE_1gtajz.png)

The dialog box that appears presents different categories of scripts in its left pane:

- **"Favorites"** lists the scripts you have "favorited" by clicking on the star that appears to the left of the script name when you hover over it.
- **"Personal"** displays the scripts you have written and saved in the Pine Editor. They are saved on TradingView's servers.
- **"Technicals"** groups most TradingView built-in scripts, organized in four categories: "Indicators", "Strategies", "Profiles", and "Patterns". Most are written in Pine Script™ and available for free.
- **"Financials"** contains all built-in indicators that display financial metrics. The contents of that tab and the subcategories they are grouped into depend on the symbol currently open on the chart.
- **"Community"** is where you can search from the more than 150,000 published scripts written by TradingView users. The scripts can be sorted by one of the three different filters — "Editors' picks" only shows open-source scripts hand-picked by our script moderators, "Top" shows the most popular scripts of all time, and "Trending" displays the most popular scripts that were published recently.
- **"Invite-only"** contains the list of the invite-only scripts you have been granted access to by their authors.

Here, we selected the "Technicals" tab to see the TradingView built-in indicators:

![image](images/First-steps-Using-scripts-Loading-scripts-from-the-chart-2.BYAmwCpy_Z4HRxF.png)

Clicking on one of the listed indicators or strategies loads the script on your chart. Strategy scripts are distinguished from indicators by a special symbol that appears to the right of the script name.

### [Browsing community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com#browsing-community-scripts)

To access the [Community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/) feed from [TradingView's homepage](https://www.tradingview.com/), select "Indicators and strategies" from the "Community" menu:

![image](images/First-steps-Using-scripts-Browsing-community-scripts-1.n_4JUux9_ZFOKWW.png)

You can also search for scripts using the homepage's "Search" field, and filter scripts using different criteria. See this Help Center page explaining the [different types of scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000558522) that are available.

The scripts feed generates *script widgets*, which show the title and author of each [publication](#script-publications) with a preview of the published chart and description. Clicking on a widget opens the *script page*, which shows the publication's complete description, an enlarged chart, and any additional release notes. Users can boost, favorite, share, and comment on publications. If it is an [open-source](#open) script, the source code is also available on the script page.

![image](images/First-steps-Using-scripts-Browsing-community-scripts-2.DQJ3ybQk_Z1aVekg.png)

When you find an interesting script in the Community scripts, follow the instructions in the Help Center to [load it on your chart](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000555216).

### [Changing script settings](https://www.tradingview.com#changing-script-settings)

Once a script is loaded on the chart, you can double-click on its name or hover over the name and press the "Settings" button to bring up its "Settings/Inputs" tab:

![image](images/FirstSteps-ChangingScriptSettings-01.D-SAixbh_Z1UAbp6.png)

The "Inputs" tab allows you to change the settings which the script's
author has decided to make editable. You can configure some of the
script's visuals using the "Style" tab of the same dialog box, and
which timeframes the script should appear on using the "Visibility"
tab.

Other settings are available to all scripts from the buttons that appear
to the right of its name when you mouse over it, and from the "More"
menu (the three dots):

![image](images/FirstSteps-ChangingScriptSettings-02.CJECCf_u_rSCqQ.png)

## [Reading scripts](https://www.tradingview.com#reading-scripts)

Reading code written by **good** programmers is the best way to develop
your understanding of the language. This is as true for Pine Script™ as
it is for all other programming languages. Finding good open-source Pine
Script™ code is relatively easy. These are reliable sources of code
written by good programmers on TradingView:

- The TradingView built-in indicators
- Scripts selected as [Editors' Picks](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/editors-picks/)
- Scripts by the [authors the PineCoders account follows](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/#following-people)
- Many scripts by authors with high reputations and [open-source](#open) publications

Reading code from [Community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/) is easy; if there is no grey or red "lock" icon in the upper-right corner of the script widget, then the script is open-source. By opening the script page, you can read its full source code.

To see the code of a TradingView built-in indicator, load the indicator on your chart, then hover over its name and select the "Source code" curly braces icon (if you don't see it, it's because the indicator's source is unavailable). When you click on the `{}` icon, the Pine Editor opens below the chart and displays the script's code. If you want to edit the script, you must first select the "Create a working copy" button. You will then be able to modify and save the code. Because the working copy is a different version of the script, you need to use the Editor's "Add to chart" button to add that new copy to the chart.

For example, this image shows the Pine Editor, where we selected to view the source code from the "Bollinger Bands" indicator on our chart. Initially, the script is *read-only*, as indicated by the orange warning text:

![image](images/First-steps-Reading-scripts-1.CxexK5PB_1rIcbY.png)

You can also open editable versions of the TradingView built-in scripts from the Pine Editor by using the "Create new" > "Built-in…" menu selection:

![image](images/First-steps-Reading-scripts-2.CB2-tfKz_1ixqjX.png)

## [Writing scripts](https://www.tradingview.com#writing-scripts)

We have built Pine Script™ to empower both new and experienced traders to create their own trading tools. Although learning a first programming language, like trading, is rarely **very** easy for anyone, we have designed Pine Script™ so it is relatively easy to learn for first-time programmers, yet powerful enough for knowledgeable programmers to build tools of moderate complexity.

Pine Script™ allows you to write three types of scripts:

- **Indicators**, like RSI, MACD, etc.
- **Strategies**, which include logic to issue trading orders and can be backtested and forward-tested.
- **Libraries**, which are used by more advanced programmers to package often-used functions that can be reused by other scripts.

The next step we recommend is to write your [first indicator](#first-indicator).

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Pine Script™ primer](#first-steps)/First indicator

# [First indicator](https://www.tradingview.com#first-indicator)

## [The Pine Editor](https://www.tradingview.com#the-pine-editor)

The Pine Editor is where you will be working on your scripts. While you can use any text editor you want to write your Pine scripts, using the Pine Editor has many advantages:

- It highlights your code following Pine Script™ syntax.
- It pops up syntax reminders when you hover over language constructs.
- It provides quick access to the Pine Script™ [Reference Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/) popup when you select `Ctrl` or `Cmd` and a [built-in](#built-ins) Pine Script™ construct, and opens the [library](#libraries) publication page when doing the same with code imported from libraries.
- It provides an auto-complete feature that you can activate by selecting `Ctrl`+`Space` or `Cmd`+`I`, depending on your operating system.
- It makes the write/compile/run cycle more efficient because saving a new version of a script already loaded on the chart automatically compiles and executes it.

To open the Pine Editor, select the "Pine Editor" tab at the bottom of the TradingView chart.

## [First version](https://www.tradingview.com#first-version)

Let's create our first working Pine script, an implementation of the [MACD](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502344-macd-moving-average-convergence-divergence/)
indicator:

1. Open the Pine Editor's dropdown menu (the arrow at the top-left corner of the Pine Editor pane, beside the script name) and select "Create new/Indicator".
2. Copy the example script code below by clicking the button on the top-right of the code widget.
3. Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the example code.
4. Save the script by selecting the script name or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`S`. Choose a name for the script (e.g., "MACD #1"). The script is saved in TradingView's cloud servers, and is local to your account, meaning only you can see and use this version.
5. Select "Add to chart" in the Pine Editor's menu bar. The MACD indicator appears in a *separate pane* under the chart.

```
//@version=6
indicator("MACD #1")
fast = 12
slow = 26
fastMA = ta.ema(close, fast)
slowMA = ta.ema(close, slow)
macd = fastMA - slowMA
signal = ta.ema(macd, 9)
plot(macd, color = color.blue)
plot(signal, color = color.orange)
```

Our first Pine script is now running on the chart, which should look like this:

![image](images/First-indicator-First-version-1.WiOSM08Z_EQDdM.png)

Let's look at our script's code, line by line:

Line 1: `//@version=6`

This is a [compiler annotation](#compiler-annotations) telling the compiler the script uses version 6 of Pine Script™.

Line 2: `indicator("MACD #1")`

Declares this script as an indicator, and defines the title of the script that appears on the chart as "MACD #1".

Line 3: `fast = 12`

Defines an integer variable `fast` as the length of the fast moving average.

Line 4: `slow = 26`

Defines an integer variable `slow` as the length of the slow moving average.

Line 5: `fastMA = ta.ema(close, fast)`

Defines the variable `fastMA`, which holds the result of the *EMA* (Exponential Moving Average) calculated on the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) series, i.e., the closing price of bars, with a length equal to `fast` (12).

Line 6: `slowMA = ta.ema(close, slow)`

Defines the variable `slowMA`, which holds the result of the EMA calculated on the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) series with a length equal to `slow` (26).

Line 7: `macd = fastMA - slowMA`

Defines the variable `macd` as the difference between the two EMAs.

Line 8: `signal = ta.ema(macd, 9)`

Defines the variable `signal` as a smoothed value of `macd` using the EMA algorithm with a length of 9.

Line 9: `plot(macd, color = color.blue)`

Calls the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function to output the variable `macd` using a blue line.

Line 10: `plot(signal, color = color.orange)`

Calls the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function to output the variable `signal` using an orange line.

## [Second version](https://www.tradingview.com#second-version)

The first version of our script calculated the MACD using multiple steps, but because Pine Script™ is specially designed to write indicators and strategies, [built-in functions](#built-ins) exist for many common indicators, including one for MACD: [ta.macd()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dmacd).

Therefore, we can write a second version of our script that takes advantage of Pine's available built-in functions:

```
//@version=6
indicator("MACD #2")
fastInput = input(12, "Fast length")
slowInput = input(26, "Slow length")
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, fastInput, slowInput, 9)
plot(macdLine, color = color.blue)
plot(signalLine, color = color.orange)
```

Note that:

- We add [inputs](#inputs) so we can change the lengths of the moving averages from the script's settings.
- We now use the [ta.macd()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dmacd) built-in function to calculate our MACD directly, which replaces three lines of calculations and makes our code easier to read.

Let's repeat the same process as before to create our new indicator:

1. Open the Pine Editor's dropdown menu (the arrow at the top-left corner of the Pine Editor pane, beside the script name) and select "Create new/Indicator".
2. Copy the example script code below. The button on the top-right of the code widget allows you to copy it with a single click.
3. Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the example code.
4. Save the script by selecting the script name or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`S`. Choose a name for your script that is different from the previous one (e.g., "MACD #2").
5. Select "Add to chart" in the Pine Editor's menu bar. The "MACD #2" indicator appears in a *separate pane* under the "MACD #1" indicator.

Our second Pine script is now running on the chart. If we double-click on the indicator's name on the chart, it displays the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab, where we can now change the fast and slow lengths used in the MACD calculation:

![image](images/First-indicator-Second-version-1.ByY_7z4B_Z1U0sz7.png)

Let's look at the lines that have changed in the second version of our script:

Line 2: `indicator("MACD #2")`

We have changed `#1` to `#2` so the second version of our indicator displays a different name on the chart.

Line 3: `fastInput = input(12, "Fast length")`

Instead of assigning a constant value to the variable, we used the [input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input) function so we can change the length value from the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. The default value is `12` and the input field's label is `"Fast length"`. When we change the value in the "Inputs" tab, the `fastInput` variable updates to contain the new length and the script re-executes on the chart with that new value. Note that, as our Pine Script™ [Style guide](#style-guide) recommends, we add `Input` to the end of the variable's name to remind us, later in the script, that its value comes from a user input.

Line 4: `slowInput = input(26, "Slow length")`

As with `fastInput` in the previous line, we do the same for the slow length, taking care to use a different variable name, default value, and title string for the input field's label.

Line 5: `[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, fastInput, slowInput, 9)`

This is where we call the [ta.macd()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dmacd) built-in function to perform all the first version's calculations in only one line. The function requires four *parameters* (the values enclosed in parentheses after the function name). It returns *three* values, unlike the other functions we've used so far that only returned one. For this reason, we need to enclose the list of three variables receiving the function's result in square brackets (to form a [tuple](#tuples)) to the left of the `=` sign. Note that two of the values we pass to the function are the "input" variables containing the fast and slow lengths (`fastInput` and `slowInput`).

Lines 6 and 7: `plot(macdLine, color = color.blue)` and `plot(signalLine, color = color.orange)`

The variable names we are plotting here have changed, but the lines still behave the same as in our first version.

Our second version of the script performs the same calculations as our first, but we've made the indicator more efficient as it now leverages Pine's built-in capabilities and easily supports variable lengths for the MACD calculation. Therefore, we have successfully improved our Pine script.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Pine Script™ primer](#first-steps)/Next steps

# [Next steps](https://www.tradingview.com#next-steps)

After your [first steps](#first-steps)
and your [first indicator](#first-indicator), let us explore a bit more of the Pine Script™ landscape by
sharing some pointers to guide you in your journey to learn Pine
Script™.

## ["indicators" vs "strategies"](https://www.tradingview.com#indicators-vs-strategies)

Pine Script™ [strategies](#strategies)
are used to backtest on historical data and forward test on open
markets. In addition to indicator calculations, they contain
`strategy.*()` calls to send trade orders to Pine Script™'s broker
emulator, which can then simulate their execution. Strategies display
backtest results in the "Strategy Tester" tab at the bottom of the
chart, next to the "Pine Editor" tab.

Pine Script™ indicators also contain calculations, but cannot be used in
backtesting. Because they do not require the broker emulator, they use
less resources and will run faster. It is thus advantageous to use
indicators whenever you can.

Both indicators and strategies can run in either overlay mode (over the
chart's bars) or pane mode (in a separate section below or above the
chart). Both can also plot information in their respective space, and
both can generate [alert events](#alerts).

## [How scripts are executed](https://www.tradingview.com#how-scripts-are-executed)

A Pine script is **not** like programs in many programming languages
that execute once and then stop. In the Pine Script™ *runtime*
environment, a script runs in the equivalent of an invisible loop where
it is executed once on each bar of whatever chart you are on, from left
to right. Chart bars that have already closed when the script executes
on them are called *historical bars*. When execution reaches the
chart's last bar and the market is open, it is on the *realtime bar*.
The script then executes once every time a price or volume change is
detected, and one last time for that realtime bar when it closes. That
realtime bar then becomes an *elapsed realtime bar*. Note that when the
script executes in realtime, it does not recalculate on all the chart's
historical bars on every price/volume update. It has already calculated
once on those bars, so it does not need to recalculate them on every
chart tick. See the
[Execution model](#execution-model)
page for more information.

When a script executes on a historical bar, the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
built-in variable holds the value of that bar's close. When a script
executes on the realtime bar,
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
returns the **current** price of the symbol until the bar closes.

Contrary to indicators, strategies normally execute only once on
realtime bars, when they close. They can also be configured to execute
on each price/volume update if that is what you need. See the page on
[Strategies](#strategies) for more
information, and to understand how strategies calculate differently than
indicators.

## [Time series](https://www.tradingview.com#time-series)

The main data structure used in Pine Script™ is called a
[time series](#time-series). Time
series contain one value for each bar the script executes on, so they
continuously expand as the script executes on more bars. Past values of
the time series can be referenced using the history-referencing
operator:
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D).
`close[1]`, for example, refers to the value of
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
on the bar preceding the one where the script is executing.

While this indexing mechanism may remind many programmers of arrays, a
time series is different and thinking in terms of arrays will be
detrimental to understanding this key Pine Script™ concept. A good
comprehension of both the
[execution model](#execution-model) and
[time series](#time-series) is
essential in understanding how Pine scripts work. If you have never
worked with data organized in time series before, you will need practice
to put them to work for you. Once you familiarize yourself with these
key concepts, you will discover that by combining the use of time series
with our built-in functions specifically designed to handle them
efficiently, much can be accomplished in very few lines of code.

## [Publishing scripts](https://www.tradingview.com#publishing-scripts)

TradingView is home to a large community of Pine Script™ programmers and
millions of traders from all around the world. Once you become
proficient enough in Pine Script™, you can choose to share your scripts
with other traders. Before doing so, please take the time to learn Pine
Script™ well-enough to supply traders with an original and reliable
tool. All publicly published scripts are analyzed by our team of
moderators and must comply with our [Script Publishing
Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599), which
require them to be original and well-documented.

If you want to use Pine scripts for your own use, simply write them in the
Pine Editor and add them to your chart from there; you don't have to
publish them to use them. If you want to share your scripts with just a
few friends, you can publish them privately and send your friends the
browser's link to your private publication. See the page on
[Publishing](#publishing) for more
information.

## [Getting around the Pine Script™ documentation](https://www.tradingview.com#getting-around-the-pine-script-documentation)

While reading code from published scripts is no doubt useful, spending
time in our documentation will be necessary to attain any degree of
proficiency in Pine Script™. Our two main sources of documentation on
Pine Script™ are:

- This Pine Script™ [v6 User
  Manual](#welcome)
- Our Pine Script™ [v6 Reference
  Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/)

The Pine Script™ [v6 User Manual](#welcome), which is located on its separate page and in English only.

The Pine Script™ [v6 Reference Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/) documents what each language construct does. It is an essential tool for all Pine Script™ programmers; your life will be miserable if you try to write scripts of any reasonable complexity without consulting it. It exists in two formats: a separate page linked above, and the popup
version. Access the popup version from the Pine Editor by either selecting `Ctrl` or `Cmd` and selecting a keyword, or by using the Editor's "More/Reference Manual…" menu. The Reference Manual is translated into multiple languages.

There are six different versions of Pine Script™ released. Ensure the
documentation you use corresponds to the Pine Script™ version you are
coding with.

## [Where to go from here?](https://www.tradingview.com#where-to-go-from-here)

This Pine Script™ [v6 User Manual](#welcome) contains numerous examples of code used to illustrate the concepts we discuss. By going through it, you will be able to both learn the
foundations of Pine Script™ and study the example scripts. Reading about
key concepts and trying them out right away with real code is a
productive way to learn any programming language. As you hopefully have
already done in the
[First indicator](#first-indicator)
page, copy this documentation's examples in the Editor and play with
them. Explore! You won't break anything.

This is how the Pine Script™ [v6 User Manual](#welcome) you are reading is organized:

- The [Language](#language) section
  explains the main components of the Pine Script™ language and how
  scripts execute.
- The [Concepts](#concepts) section
  is more task-oriented. It explains how to do things in Pine Script™.
- The [Writing](#writing) section

#### First indicator](#first-indicator)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Execution model

# [Execution model](https://www.tradingview.com#execution-model)

The execution model of the Pine Script™ runtime is intimately linked to
Pine Script™'s [time series](#time-series) and [type system](#type-system). Understanding all three is key to making the most of the
power of Pine Script™.

The execution model determines how your script is executed on charts,
and thus how the code you write in scripts works. Your code would do
nothing were it not for Pine Script™'s runtime, which kicks in after
your code has compiled and it is executed on your chart because one of
the
[events triggering the execution of a script](#events-triggering-the-execution-of-a-script) has occurred.

When a Pine script is loaded on a chart it executes once on each
historical bar using the available OHLCV (open, high, low, close,
volume) values for each bar. Once the script's execution reaches the
rightmost bar in the dataset, if trading is currently active on the
chart's symbol, then Pine Script™ *indicators* will execute once every
time an *update* occurs, i.e., price or volume changes. Pine Script™
*strategies* will by default only execute when the rightmost bar closes,
but they can also be configured to execute on every update, like
indicators do.

All symbol/timeframe pairs have a dataset comprising a limited number of
bars. When you scroll a chart to the left to see the dataset's earlier
bars, the corresponding bars are loaded on the chart. The loading
process stops when there are no more bars for that particular
symbol/timeframe pair or the [maximum number of
bars](#chart-bars)
your account type permits has been loaded. You can scroll the chart to
the left until the very first bar of the dataset, which has an index
value of 0 (see
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)).

When the script first runs on a chart, all bars in a dataset are
*historical bars*, except the rightmost one if a trading session is
active. When trading is active on the rightmost bar, it is called the
*realtime bar*. The realtime bar updates when a price or volume change
is detected. When the realtime bar closes, it becomes an *elapsed
realtime bar* and a new realtime bar opens.

## [Calculation based on historical bars](https://www.tradingview.com#calculation-based-on-historical-bars)

Let's take a simple script and follow its execution on historical bars:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script", overlay = true)
src = close
a = ta.sma(src, 5)
b = ta.sma(src, 50)
c = ta.cross(a, b)
plot(a, color = color.blue)
plot(b, color = color.black)
plotshape(c, color = color.red)
```

On historical bars, a script executes at the equivalent of the bar's
close, when the OHLCV values are all known for that bar. Prior to
execution of the script on a bar, the built-in variables such as `open`,
`high`, `low`, `close`, `volume` and `time` are set to values
corresponding to those from that bar. A script executes **once per
historical bar**.

Our example script is first executed on the very first bar of the
dataset at index 0. Each statement is executed using the values for the
current bar. Accordingly, on the first bar of the dataset, the following
statement:

```
src = close
```

initializes the variable `src` with the `close` value for that first
bar, and each of the next lines is executed in turn. Because the script
only executes once for each historical bar, the script will always
calculate using the same `close` value for a specific historical bar.

The execution of each line in the script produces calculations which in
turn generate the indicator's output values, which can then be plotted
on the chart. Our example uses the `plot` and `plotshape` calls at the
end of the script to output some values. In the case of a strategy, the
outcome of the calculations can be used to plot values or dictate the
orders to be placed.

After execution and plotting on the first bar, the script is executed on
the dataset's second bar, which has an index of 1. The process then
repeats until all historical bars in the dataset are processed and the
script reaches the rightmost bar on the chart.

![image](images/execution_model_calculation_on_history.ZMeUmfch_jaqxS.png)

## [Calculation based on realtime bars](https://www.tradingview.com#calculation-based-on-realtime-bars)

The behavior of a Pine script on the realtime bar is very different than
on historical bars. Recall that the realtime bar is the rightmost bar on
the chart when trading is active on the chart's symbol. Also, recall
that strategies can behave in two different ways in the realtime bar. By
default, they only execute when the realtime bar closes, but the
`calc_on_every_tick` parameter of the `strategy` declaration statement
can be set to true to modify the strategy's behavior so that it
executes each time the realtime bar updates, as indicators do. The
behavior described here for indicators will thus only apply to
strategies using `calc_on_every_tick=true`.

The most important difference between execution of scripts on historical
and realtime bars is that while they execute only once on historical
bars, scripts execute every time an update occurs during a realtime bar.
This entails that built-in variables such as `high`, `low` and `close`
which never change on a historical bar, **can** change at each of a
script's iteration in the realtime bar. Changes in the built-in
variables used in the script's calculations will, in turn, induce
changes in the results of those calculations. This is required for the
script to follow the realtime price action. As a result, the same script
may produce different results every time it executes during the realtime
bar.

**Note:** In the realtime bar, the `close` variable always represents
the **current price**. Similarly, the `high` and `low` built-in
variables represent the highest high and lowest low reached since the
realtime bar's beginning. Pine Script™'s built-in variables will only
represent the realtime bar's final values on the bar's last update.

Let's follow our script example in the realtime bar.

When the script arrives on the realtime bar it executes a first time. It
uses the current values of the built-in variables to produce a set of
results and plots them if required. Before the script executes another
time when the next update happens, its user-defined variables are reset
to a known state corresponding to that of the last *commit* at the close
of the previous bar. If no commit was made on the variables because they
are initialized every bar, then they are reinitialized. In both cases
their last calculated state is lost. The state of plotted labels and
lines is also reset. This resetting of the script's user-defined
variables and drawings prior to each new iteration of the script in the
realtime bar is called *rollback*. Its effect is to reset the script to
the same known state it was in when the realtime bar opened, so
calculations in the realtime bar are always performed from a clean
state.

The constant recalculation of a script's values as price or volume
changes in the realtime bar can lead to a situation where variable `c`
in our example becomes true because a cross has occurred, and so the red
marker plotted by the script's last line would appear on the chart. If
on the next price update the price has moved in such a way that the
`close` value no longer produces calculations making `c` true because
there is no longer a cross, then the marker previously plotted will
disappear.

When the realtime bar closes, the script executes a last time. As usual,
variables are rolled back prior to execution. However, since this
iteration is the last one on the realtime bar, variables are committed
to their final values for the bar when calculations are completed.

To summarize the realtime bar process:

- A script executes **at the open of the realtime bar and then once per update**.
- Variables are rolled back **before every realtime update**.
- Variables are committed **once at the closing bar update**.

## [Events triggering the execution of a script](https://www.tradingview.com#events-triggering-the-execution-of-a-script)

A script executes across *all* available bars in a dataset when one of the following conditions occurs:

- The user adds the script to their chart from the Pine Editor or the "Indicators, Metrics & Strategies" menu.
- The user saves a new version of the source code while the script is on the chart.
- The chart uses a new *timeframe*.
- The chart uses a dataset with a new *ticker identifier*. Several user actions affect a chart's ticker ID, such as selecting a symbol from the "Symbol search" menu, switching between standard and non-standard chart types, activating [Bar Replay](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000474024-how-do-i-turn-bar-replay-on/) mode, and toggling data modifications from the chart's settings.
- The user changes any [input](#inputs) available in the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab.
- The user updates a [strategy property](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000628599-strategy-properties/) from the "Settings/Properties" tab.
- The script uses the [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) or [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) variable in its calculations or logic, and the user changes the variable's value by scrolling or zooming on the chart.
- The system detects a browser refresh event.
- The user opens or closes the [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane.
- The user activates or deactivates the [Pine Profiler](#pine-profiler).

Either of the following triggers script executions on a *realtime bar* while the chart symbol's session is active:

- One of the conditions above occurs, causing the script to execute across the *entire* dataset up to the latest bar.
- The realtime bar's values change after new price or volume data becomes available. The script performs a *new execution* on that bar to use the latest information in its calculations.

Note that when a chart is left untouched when the market is active, a
succession of realtime bars which have been opened and then closed will
trail the current realtime bar. While these *elapsed realtime bars* will
have been *confirmed* because their variables have all been committed,
the script will not yet have executed on them in their *historical*
state, since they did not exist when the script was last run on the
chart's dataset.

When an event triggers the execution of the script on the chart and
causes it to run on those bars which have now become historical bars,
the script's calculation can sometimes vary from what they were when
calculated on the last closing update of the same bars when they were
realtime bars. This can be caused by slight variations between the OHLCV
values saved at the close of realtime bars and those fetched from data
feeds when the same bars have become historical bars. This behavior is
one of the possible causes of *repainting*.

## [More information](https://www.tradingview.com#more-information)

- The built-in `barstate.*` variables provide information on
  [the type of bar or the event](#bar-states) where the script is executing. The page where they are
  documented also contains a script that allows you to visualize the
  difference between elapsed realtime and historical bars, for
  example.
- The [Strategies](#strategies) page
  explains the details of strategy calculations, which are not
  identical to those of indicators.

## [Historical values of functions](https://www.tradingview.com#historical-values-of-functions)

Every function call in Pine leaves a trail of historical values that a
script can access on subsequent bars using the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
operator. The historical series of functions depend on successive calls
to record the output on every bar. When a script does not call functions
on each bar, it can produce an inconsistent history that may impact
calculations and results, namely when it depends on the continuity of
their historical series to operate as expected. The compiler warns users
in these cases to make them aware that the values from a function,
whether built-in or user-defined, might be misleading.

To demonstrate, let's write a script that calculates the index of the
current bar and outputs that value on every second bar. In the following
script, we've defined a `calcBarIndex()` function that adds 1 to the
previous value of its internal `index` variable on every bar. The script
calls the function on each bar that the `condition` returns `true` on
(every other bar) to update the `customIndex` value. It plots this value
alongside the built-in `bar_index` to validate the output:

![image](images/Function_historical_context_1.BS8uzH0h_1erubd.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("My script")

//@function Calculates the index of the current bar by adding 1 to its own value from the previous bar.
// The first bar will have an index of 0.
calcBarIndex() =>
    int index = na
    index := nz(index[1], replacement = -1) + 1

//@variable Returns `true` on every other bar.
condition = bar_index % 2 == 0

int customIndex = na

// Call `calcBarIndex()` when the `condition` is `true`. This prompts the compiler to raise a warning.
if condition
    customIndex := calcBarIndex()

plot(bar_index,   "Bar index",    color = color.green)
plot(customIndex, "Custom index", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross)
```

**Note that:**

- The
  [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz)
  function replaces
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values with a specified `replacement` value (0 by default). On the
  first bar of the script, when the `index` series has no history, the
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  value is replaced with -1 before adding 1 to return an initial value
  of 0.

Upon inspecting the chart, we see that the two plots differ wildly. The
reason for this behavior is that the script called `calcBarIndex()`
within the scope of an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure on every other bar, resulting in a historical output
inconsistent with the `bar_index` series. When calling the function once
every two bars, internally referencing the previous value of `index`
gets the value from two bars ago, i.e., the last bar the function
executed on. This behavior results in a `customIndex` value of half that
of the built-in `bar_index`.

To align the `calcBarIndex()` output with the `bar_index`, we can move
the function call to the script's global scope. That way, the function
will execute on every bar, allowing its entire history to be recorded
and referenced rather than only the results from every other bar. In the
code below, we've defined a `globalScopeBarIndex` variable in the
global scope and assigned it to the return from `calcBarIndex()` rather
than calling the function locally. The script sets the `customIndex` to
the value of `globalScopeBarIndex` on the occurrence of the `condition`:

![image](images/Function_historical_context_2.DMU4JJfT_ZCks6f.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("My script")

//@function Calculates the index of the current bar by adding 1 to its own value from the previous bar.
// The first bar will have an index of 0.
calcBarIndex() =>
    int index = na
    index := nz(index[1], replacement = -1) + 1

//@variable Returns `true` on every second bar.
condition = bar_index % 2 == 0

globalScopeBarIndex = calcBarIndex()
int customIndex = na

// Assign `customIndex` to `globalScopeBarIndex` when the `condition` is `true`. This won't produce a warning.
if condition
    customIndex := globalScopeBarIndex

plot(bar_index,   "Bar index",    color = color.green)
plot(customIndex, "Custom index", color = color.red, style = plot.style_cross)
```

This behavior can also radically impact built-in functions that
reference history internally. For example, the
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dsma)
function references its past values "under the hood". If a script
calls this function conditionally rather than on every bar, the values
within the calculation can change significantly. We can ensure
calculation consistency by assigning
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dsma)
to a variable in the global scope and referencing that variable's
history as needed.

The following example calculates three SMA series: `controlSMA`,
`localSMA`, and `globalSMA`. The script calculates `controlSMA` in the
global scope and `localSMA` within the local scope of an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure. Within the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure, it also updates the value of `globalSMA` using the
`controlSMA` value. As we can see, the values from the `globalSMA` and
`controlSMA` series align, whereas the `localSMA` series diverges from
the other two because it uses an incomplete history, which affects its
calculations:

![image](images/Function_historical_context_3.B-yx15UY_1PfdyK.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("My script")

//@variable Returns `true` on every second bar.
condition = bar_index % 2 == 0

controlSMA = ta.sma(close, 20)
float globalSMA = na
float localSMA  = na

// Update `globalSMA` and `localSMA` when `condition` is `true`.
if condition
    globalSMA := controlSMA        // No warning.
    localSMA  := ta.sma(close, 20) // Raises warning. This function depends on its history to work as intended.

plot(controlSMA, "Control SMA", color = color.green)
plot(globalSMA,  "Global SMA",  color = color.blue, style = plot.style_cross)
plot(localSMA,   "Local SMA",   color = color.red,  style = plot.style_cross)
```

### [Why this behavior?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-this-behavior)

This behavior is required because forcing the execution of functions on
each bar would lead to unexpected results in those functions that
produce side effects, i.e., the ones that do something aside from
returning the value. For example, the
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
function creates a label on the chart, so forcing it to be called on
every bar even when it is inside of an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure would create labels where they should not logically appear.

### [Exceptions](https://www.tradingview.com#exceptions)

Not all built-in functions use their previous values in their
calculations, meaning not all require execution on every bar. For
example,
[math.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math%7Bdot%7Dmax)
compares all arguments passed into it to return the highest value. Such
functions that do not interact with their history in any way do not
require special treatment.

If the usage of a function within a conditional block does not cause a
compiler warning, it's safe to use without impacting calculations.
Otherwise, move the function call to the global scope to force
consistent execution. When keeping a function call within a conditional
block despite the warning, ensure the output is correct at the very
least to avoid unexpected results.

#### Time series](#time-series)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Time series

# [Time series](https://www.tradingview.com#time-series)

Much of the power of Pine Script™ stems from the fact that it is
designed to process *time series* efficiently. Time series are not a
qualified type; they are the fundamental structure Pine Script™ uses to
store the successive values of a variable over time, where each value is
tethered to a point in time. Since charts are composed of bars, each
representing a particular point in time, time series are the ideal data
structure to work with values that may change with time.

The notion of time series is intimately linked to Pine's
[execution model](#execution-model) and
[type system](#type-system) concepts.
Understanding all three is key to making the most of the power of Pine
Script™.

Take the built-in
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
variable, which contains the "open" price of each bar in the dataset,
the *dataset* being all the bars on any given chart. If your script is
running on a 5min chart, then each value in the
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
time series is the "open" price of the consecutive 5min chart bars.
When your script refers to
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
it is referring to the "open" price of the bar the script is executing
on. To refer to past values in a time series, we use the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
history-referencing operator. When a script is executing on a given bar,
`open[1]` refers to the value of the
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
time series on the previous bar.

While time series may remind programmers of arrays, they are totally
different. Pine Script™ does have an [array](#arrays) data structure, but it is a
completely different concept than a time series.

Time series in Pine Script™, combined with its special runtime engine and built-in functions, make it easy to compute calculations across bars without needing a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop. For example, we can calculate the cumulative total of [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values by using the [ta.cum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.cum) function. Although `ta.cum(close)` appears rather static in a script, it is in fact executed on *each* bar, so its value becomes increasingly larger as it continues adding the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values of each new bar. When the script reaches the rightmost bar of the chart, `ta.cum(close)` returns the sum of the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values from *all* bars on the chart.

Similarly, Pine scripts can calculate the mean of the difference between the last 14 [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) values using the [ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma) function (`ta.sma(high - low, 14)`), or the distance in bars since the last time the chart made five consecutive higher highs by combining [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) and [ta.rising()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rising) calls (`ta.barssince(ta.rising(high, 5))`).

The result of function calls on successive bars leaves a succession of values in a time series that scripts can reference using the [[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D) history-referencing operator. This can be useful, for example, when testing the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) of the current bar for a breach of the highest [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) in the last 10 bars, but excluding the current bar, which we could write as `breach = close > ta.highest(close, 10)[1]`. The same statement could also be written as `breach = close > ta.highest(close[1], 10)`.

The same logic of executing a single code statement on all bars applies to function calls such as [plot(open)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), which will repeat on each bar to successively plot the values of the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) time series on the chart.

Do not confuse "time series" with the "series" qualifier. The *time
series* concept explains how consecutive values of variables are stored
in Pine Script™; the "series" qualifier denotes variables whose values
can change from bar to bar. Consider, for example, the
[timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dperiod)
built-in variable, which has the "simple" qualifier and "string"
type, meaning it is of the "simple string" qualified type. The
"simple" qualifier entails that the variable's value is established
on bar zero (the first bar where the script executes) and does not
change during the script's execution on any of the chart's bars. The
variable's value is the chart's timeframe in "string" format, so `"1D"`
for a daily chart, for example. Even though its value cannot change during
the script's execution, it would be syntactically correct in Pine Script™ (though
not very useful) to refer to its value 10 bars ago using
`timeframe.period[10]`. This is possible because the successive values
of
[timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dperiod)
for each bar are stored in a time series, even though all the values in
that particular time series are the same. Note, however, that when the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
operator is used to access past values of a variable, it yields a
"series" qualified value, even when the variable without an offset
uses a different qualifier, such as "simple" in the case of
[timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dperiod).

Programmers can define complex calculations using little code by using Pine's syntax and [execution model](#execution-model) to efficiently handle time series.

#### Script structure](#script-structure)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Script structure

# [Script structure](https://www.tradingview.com#script-structure)

A Pine script follows this general structure:

```
<version><declaration_statement><code>
```

## [Version](https://www.tradingview.com#version)

A
[compiler annotation](#compiler-annotations) in the following form tells the compiler which of the
versions of Pine Script™ the script is written in:

```
//@version=6
```

- The version number is a number from 1 to 6.
- The compiler annotation is not mandatory. When omitted, version 1 is
  assumed. It is strongly recommended to always use the latest version
  of the language.
- While it is synctactically correct to place the version compiler
  annotation anywhere in the script, it is much more useful to readers
  when it appears at the top of the script.

Notable changes to the current version of Pine Script™ are documented in
the [Release notes](#release-notes).

## [Declaration statement](https://www.tradingview.com#declaration-statement)

All Pine scripts must contain one declaration statement, which is a call
to one of these functions:

- [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
- [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
- [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)

The declaration statement:

- Identifies the type of the script, which in turn dictates which
  content is allowed in it, and how it can be used and executed.
- Sets key properties of the script such as its name, where it will
  appear when it is added to a chart, the precision and format of the
  values it displays, and certain values that govern its runtime
  behavior, such as the maximum number of drawing objects it will
  display on the chart. With strategies, the properties include
  parameters that control backtesting, such as initial capital,
  commission, slippage, etc.

Each script type has distinct basic requirements. Scripts that do not meet these criteria cause a compilation error:

- Indicators must call at least one function that creates a script output, such as [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape), [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor), [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new), [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info), [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert), etc.
- [Strategies](#strategies) must call at least one [order placement command](#order-placement-and-cancellation) or other output function.
- [Libraries](#libraries) must [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export) at least one user-defined [function](#user-defined-functions), [method](#user-defined-methods), [type](#user-defined-types), or [enum](#enums).

## [Code](https://www.tradingview.com#code)

Lines in a script that are not
[comments](#comments)
or
[compiler annotations](#compiler-annotations) are *statements*, which implement the script's algorithm. A
statement can be one of these:

- [variable declaration](#variable-declarations)
- [variable reassignment](#variable-reassignment)
- [function declaration](#multi-line-functions)
- [built-in function call](#built-in-functions),
  [user-defined function call](#user-defined-functions) or
  [a library function call](#using-a-library)
- [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if),
  [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for),
  [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while),
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch),
  [type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_type), or
  [enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_enum)*structure*.

Statements can be arranged in multiple ways:

- Some statements can be expressed in one line, like most variable
  declarations, lines containing only a function call or single-line
  function declarations. Lines can also be
  [wrapped](#line-wrapping) (continued on multiple lines). Multiple one-line
  statements can be concatenated on a single line by using the comma
  as a separator.
- Others statements such as structures or multi-line function
  declarations always require multiple lines because they require a
  *local block*. A local block must be indented by a tab or four
  spaces. Each local block defines a distinct *local scope*.
- Statements in the *global scope* of the script (i.e., which are not
  part of local blocks) cannot begin with white space (a space or a
  tab). Their first character must also be the line's first
  character. Lines beginning in a line's first position become by
  definition part of the script's *global scope*.

A simple valid Pine Script™ indicator can be generated in the Pine
Script™ Editor by using the "Open" button and choosing "New blank
indicator":

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
plot(close)
```

This indicator includes three local blocks, one in the `barIsUp()` function
declaration, and two in the variable declaration using an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure:

```
//@version=6

indicator("", "", true)    // Declaration statement (global scope)

barIsUp() =>    // Function declaration (global scope)
    close > open    // Local block (local scope)

plotColor = if barIsUp()  // Variable declaration (global scope)
    color.green     // Local block (local scope)
else
    color.red       // Local block (local scope)

bgcolor(color.new(plotColor, 70))   // Call to a built-in function  (global scope)
```

You can bring up a simple Pine Script™ strategy by selecting "New
blank strategy" instead:

```
//@version=6
strategy("My Strategy", overlay=true, margin_long=100, margin_short=100)

longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (shortCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)
```

## [Comments](https://www.tradingview.com#comments)

Double slashes (`//`) define comments in Pine Script™. Comments can
begin anywhere on the line. They can also follow Pine Script™ code on
the same line:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
// This line is a comment
a = close // This is also a comment
plot(a)
```

The Pine Editor has a keyboard shortcut to comment/uncomment lines:
`ctrl` + `/`. You can use it on multiple lines by highlighting them
first.

## [Line wrapping](https://www.tradingview.com#line-wrapping)

Long lines can be split on multiple lines, or "wrapped". Wrapped lines
must be indented with any number of spaces, provided it's not a
multiple of four (those boundaries are used to indent local blocks):

```
a = open + high + low + close
```

may be wrapped as:

```
a = open +
      high +
          low +
             close
```

A long
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
call may be wrapped as:

```
plot(ta.correlation(src, ovr, length),
   color = color.new(color.purple, 40),
   style = plot.style_area,
   trackprice = true)
```

Expressions inside *local* code blocks can also use line wrapping. However, because the code in a local block requires indentation by four spaces or a tab, we recommend using a *larger* indentation that is not a multiple of four spaces for the wrapped lines inside the block. For example:

```
upDown(float s) =>
    var int ud = 0
    bool isEqual   = s == s[1]
    bool isGrowing = s > s[1]
    ud := isEqual ?
           0 :
           isGrowing ?
               (ud <= 0 ?
                     1 :
                   ud + 1) :
               (ud >= 0 ?
                   -1 :
                   ud - 1)
```

Wrapped lines can also include [comments](#comments):

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
c = open > close ? color.red :
  high > high[1] ? color.lime : // A comment
  low < low[1] ? color.blue : color.black
bgcolor(c)
```

## [Compiler annotations](https://www.tradingview.com#compiler-annotations)

Compiler annotations are
[comments](#comments)
that issue special instructions for a script:

- `//@version=` specifies the PineScript™ version that the compiler
  will use. The number in this annotation should not be confused with
  the script's version number, which updates on every saved change
  to the code.
- `//@description` sets a custom description for scripts that use the
  [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)
  declaration statement.
- `//@function`, `//@param` and `//@returns` add custom descriptions
  for a [user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) or [method](#methods), its parameters, and its result when placed above the function declaration.
- `//@type` adds a custom description for a [user-defined type (UDT)](#user-defined-types) when placed
  above the type declaration.
- `//@enum` adds a custom description for an [enum types](#enum-types) when placed above the enum declaration.
- `//@field` adds a custom description for the field of a [user-defined type (UDT)](#user-defined-types) or an [enum types](#enum-types) when placed above the type or enum declaration.
- `//@variable` adds a custom description for a variable when placed
  above its declaration.
- `//@strategy_alert_message` provides a default message for strategy
  scripts to pre-fill the "Message" field in the alert creation
  dialog.

The Pine Editor also features two specialized annotations, `//#region` and `//#endregion`, that create *collapsible* code regions.
Clicking the dropdown arrow next to a `//#region` line collapses all the code between that line and the nearest `//#endregion` annotation
below it.

This example draws a triangle using three interactively selected points on the chart.
The script illustrates how one can use compiler and Editor annotations to document code and make it easier to navigate:

    line.new(t.time2, t.price2, t.time3, t.price3, xloc = xloc.bar_time, color = t.lineColor)

    triangle.time2  := x2Input
    triangle.time3  := x3Input
    triangle.price1 := y1Input
    triangle.price2 := y2Input
    triangle.price3 := y3Input
    triangle.lineColor := color.purple

    drawTriangle(triangle)
//#endregion

# [Identifiers](https://www.tradingview.com#identifiers)

Identifiers are names used for user-defined variables and functions:

- They must begin with an uppercase (`A-Z`) or lowercase (`a-z`)
  letter, or an underscore (`_`).
- The next characters can be letters, underscores or digits (`0-9`).
- They are case-sensitive.

Here are some examples:

# [Operators](https://www.tradingview.com#operators)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Some operators are used to build *expressions* returning a result:

- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- The
  [?:](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%7Bquestion%7D%7Bcolon%7D)
  ternary operator
- The
  [[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
  history-referencing operator

Other operators are used to assign values to variables:

- `=` is used to assign a value to a variable, **but only when you
  declare the variable** (the first time you use it)
- `:=` is used to assign a value to a **previously declared
  variable**. The following operators can also be used in such a way:
  `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`

As is explained in the [Type system](#type-system) page, *qualifiers* and *types* play a critical role in
determining the type of results that expressions yield. This, in turn,
has an impact on how and with what functions you will be allowed to use
those results. Expressions always return a value with the strongest
qualifier used in the expression, e.g., if you multiply an "input int"
with a "series int", the expression will produce a "series int"
result, which you will not be able to use as the argument to `length` in
[ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dema).

This script will produce a compilation error:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
lenInput = input.int(14, "Length")
factor = year > 2020 ? 3 : 1
adjustedLength = lenInput * factor
ma = ta.ema(close, adjustedLength)  // Compilation error!
plot(ma)
```

The compiler will complain: *Cannot call 'ta.ema' with argument
'length'='adjustedLength'. An argument of 'series int' type was
used but a 'simple int' is expected;*. This is happening because
`lenInput` is an "input int" but `factor` is a "series int" (it can
only be determined by looking at the value of
[year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year)
on each bar). The `adjustedLength` variable is thus assigned a "series
int" value. Our problem is that the Reference Manual entry for
[ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dema)
tells us that its `length` parameter requires a "simple" value, which
is a weaker qualifier than "series", so a "series int" value is not
allowed.

The solution to our conundrum requires:

- Using another moving average function that supports a "series int"
  length, such as
  [ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dsma),
  or
- Not using a calculation producing a "series int" value for our
  length.

## [Arithmetic operators](https://www.tradingview.com#arithmetic-operators)

There are five arithmetic operators in Pine Script™:

OperatorMeaning`+`Addition and string concatenation`-`Subtraction`*`Multiplication`/`Division`%`Modulo (remainder after division)The arithmetic operators above are all *binary*, meaning they need two *operands* — or values — to work on, as in the example operation `1 + 2`. The `+` and `-` can also be *unary* operators, which means they work on one operand, as in the example values `-1` or `+1`.

If both operands are numbers but at least one of these is of
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
type, the result will also be a
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float).
If both operands are of
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
type, the result will also be an
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int).
If at least one operand is
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), the
result is also
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

Note that when using the division operator with "int" operands, if the two "int" values are not evenly divisible, the result of the division is always a number with a fractional value, e.g., `5/2 = 2.5`. To discard the fractional remainder, wrap the division with the [int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int) function, or round the result using [math.round()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.round), [math.floor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.floor), or [math.ceil()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.ceil).

The `+` operator also serves as the concatenation operator for strings.
`"EUR"+"USD"` yields the `"EURUSD"` string.

The `%` operator calculates the modulo by rounding down the quotient to
the lowest possible value. Here is an easy example that helps illustrate
how the modulo is calculated behind the scenes:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Modulo function")
modulo(series int a, series int b) =>
    a - b * math.floor(nz(a/b))
plot(modulo(-1, 100))
```

## [Comparison operators](https://www.tradingview.com#comparison-operators)

There are six comparison operators in Pine Script™:

OperatorMeaning`<`Less Than`<=`Less Than or Equal To`!=`Not Equal`==`Equal`>`Greater Than`>=`Greater Than or Equal ToComparison operations are binary, and return a result of type "bool", i.e., [true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true) or [false](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_false). The `==` equal and `!=` not equal operators can work with operands of any fundamental type, such as colors and strings, while the other comparison operators are only applicable to numerical values. Therefore, `"a" != "b"` is a valid comparison, but `"a" > "b"` is invalid.

Examples:

```
1 > 2  // false
1 != 1 // false
close >= open  // Depends on values of `close` and `open`
```

## [Logical operators](https://www.tradingview.com#logical-operators)

There are three logical operators in Pine Script™:

OperatorMeaning`not`Negation`and`Logical Conjunction`or`Logical DisjunctionThe operator `not` is unary. When applied to a `true`, operand the
result will be `false`, and vice versa.

`and` operator truth table:

aba and btruetruetruetruefalsefalsefalsetruefalsefalsefalsefalse`or` operator truth table:

aba or btruetruetruetruefalsetruefalsetruetruefalsefalsefalse## [`?:` ternary operator](https://www.tradingview.com#-ternary-operator)

The
[?:](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%7Bquestion%7D%7Bcolon%7D)
ternary operator is used to create expressions of the form:

```
condition ? valueWhenConditionIsTrue : valueWhenConditionIsFalse
```

The ternary operator returns a result that depends on the value of `condition`. If it is `true`, then it returns `valueWhenConditionIsTrue`. Otherwise, if `condition` is `false`, then it returns `valueWhenConditionIsFalse`.

A combination of ternary expressions can be used to achieve the same
effect as a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure, e.g.:

```
timeframe.isintraday ? color.red : timeframe.isdaily ? color.green : timeframe.ismonthly ? color.blue : na
```

The example is calculated from left to right:

- If
  [timeframe.isintraday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disintraday)
  is `true`, then `color.red` is returned. If it is `false`, then
  [timeframe.isdaily](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disdaily)
  is evaluated.
- If
  [timeframe.isdaily](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disdaily)
  is `true`, then `color.green` is returned. If it is `false`, then
  [timeframe.ismonthly](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dismonthly)
  is evaluated.
- If
  [timeframe.ismonthly](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dismonthly)
  is `true`, then `color.blue` is returned, otherwise
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  is returned.

Note that the return values on each side of the `:` are expressions ---
not local blocks, so they will not affect the limit of 500 local blocks
per scope.

## [`[ ]` history-referencing operator](https://www.tradingview.com#--history-referencing-operator)

It is possible to refer to past values of
[time series](#time-series) using the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
history-referencing operator. Past values are values a variable had on
bars preceding the bar where the script is currently executing — the
*current bar*. See the
[Execution model](#execution-model)
page for more information about the way scripts are executed on bars.

The
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
operator is used after a variable, expression or function call. The
value used inside the square brackets of the operator is the offset in
the past we want to refer to. To refer to the value of the
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
built-in variable two bars away from the current bar, one would use
`volume[2]`.

Because series grow dynamically, as the script calculates on successive bars, a constant historical offset refers to different bars. Let's see how the value returned by the same offset is dynamic, and why series are very different from arrays. In Pine Script™, the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
variable, or `close[0]` which is equivalent, holds the value of the
current bar's "close". If your code is now executing on the **third**
bar of the *dataset* (the set of all bars on your chart), `close` will
contain the price at the close of that bar, `close[1]` will contain the
price at the close of the preceding bar (the dataset's second bar), and
`close[2]`, the first bar. `close[3]` will return
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
because no bar exists in that position, and thus its value is *not
available*.

When the same code is executed on the next bar, the **fourth** in the
dataset, `close` will now contain the closing price of that bar, and the
same `close[1]` used in your code will now refer to the "close" of the
third bar in the dataset. The close of the first bar in the dataset will
now be `close[3]`, and this time `close[4]` will return
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

In the Pine Script™ runtime environment, as your code is executed once
for each historical bar in the dataset, starting from the left of the
chart, Pine Script™ is adding a new element in the series at index 0 and
pushing the pre-existing elements in the series one index further away.
Arrays, in comparison, can have constant or variable sizes, and their
content or indexing structure is not modified by the runtime
environment. Pine Script™ series are thus very different from arrays and
only share familiarity with them through their indexing syntax.

When the market for the chart's symbol is open and the script is
executing on the chart's last bar, the *realtime bar*,
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
returns the value of the current price. It will only contain the actual
closing price of the realtime bar the last time the script is executed
on that bar, when it closes.

Pine Script™ has a variable that contains the number of the bar the
script is executing on:
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).
On the first bar,
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
is equal to 0 and it increases by 1 on each successive bar the script
executes on. On the last bar,
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
is equal to the number of bars in the dataset minus one.

There is another important consideration to keep in mind when using the
`[]` operator in Pine Script™. We have seen cases when a history
reference may return the
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
value.
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
represents a value which is not a number and using it in any expression
will produce a result that is also
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
(similar to [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN)). Such cases often
happen during the script's calculations in the early bars of the
dataset, but can also occur in later bars under certain conditions.
If your code does not explicitly handle these special cases using the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) and [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) functions, [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values can introduce invalid results in your script's calculations that can affect calculations all the way to the realtime bar.

These are all valid uses of the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
operator:

```
high[10]
ta.sma(close, 10)[1]
ta.highest(high, 10)[20]
close > nz(close[1], open)
```

Note that the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
operator can only be used once on the same value. This is not allowed:

```
close[1][2] // Error: incorrect use of [] operator
```

## [Operator precedence](https://www.tradingview.com#operator-precedence)

The order of calculations is determined by the operators' precedence.
Operators with greater precedence are calculated first. Below is a list
of operators sorted by decreasing precedence:

PrecedenceOperator9`[]`8unary `+`, unary `-`, `not`7`*`, `/`, `%`6`+`, `-`5`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`4`==`, `!=`3`and`2`or`1`?:`If in one expression there are several operators with the same
precedence, then they are calculated left to right.

If the expression must be calculated in a different order than
precedence would dictate, then parts of the expression can be grouped
together with parentheses.

## [`=` assignment operator](https://www.tradingview.com#-assignment-operator)

The `=` operator is used to assign a variable when it is initialized ---
or declared ---, i.e., the first time you use it. It says *this is a new
variable that I will be using, and I want it to start on each bar with
this value*.

These are all valid variable declarations:

```
i = 1
MS_IN_ONE_MINUTE = 1000 * 60
showPlotInput = input.bool(true, "Show plots")
pHi = ta.pivothigh(5, 5)
plotColor = color.green
```

See the
[Variable declarations](#variable-declarations) page for more information on how to declare variables.

## [`:=` reassignment operator](https://www.tradingview.com#-reassignment-operator)

The `:=` is used to *reassign* a value to an existing variable. It says
*use this variable that was declared earlier in my script, and give it a
new value*.

Variables which have been first declared, then reassigned using `:=`,
are called *mutable* variables. All the following examples are valid
variable reassignments. You will find more information on how
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
works in the section on the
[`var` declaration mode](#var):

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
// Declare `pHi` and initilize it on the first bar only.
var float pHi = na
// Reassign a value to `pHi`
pHi := nz(ta.pivothigh(5, 5), pHi)
plot(pHi)
```

Note that:

- We declare `pHi` with this code: `var float pHi = na`. The
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword tells Pine Script™ that we only want that variable
  initialized with
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  on the dataset's first bar. The `float` keyword tells the compiler
  we are declaring a variable of type "float". This is necessary
  because, contrary to most cases, the compiler cannot automatically
  determine the type of the value on the right side of the `=` sign.
- While the variable declaration will only be executed on the first
  bar because it uses
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var),
  the `pHi := nz(ta.pivothigh(5, 5), pHi)` line will be executed on
  all the chart's bars. On each bar, it evaluates if the
  [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivothigh)
  call returns
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  because that is what the function does when it hasn't found a new
  pivot. The
  [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz)
  function is the one doing the "checking for
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)"
  part. When its first argument (`ta.pivothigh(5, 5)`) is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
  it returns the second argument (`pHi`) instead of the first. When
  [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivothigh)
  returns the price point of a newly found pivot, that value is
  assigned to `pHi`. When it returns
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  because no new pivot was found, we assign the previous value of
  `pHi` to itself, in effect preserving its previous value.

The output of our script looks like this:

![image](images/Operators-ReassignmentOperator-1.D7pw1mZ8_Z2fUVUR.png)

Note that:

- The line preserves its previous value until a new pivot is found.
- Pivots are detected five bars after the pivot actually occurs
  because our `ta.pivothigh(5, 5)` call says that we require five
  lower highs on both sides of a high point for it to be detected as a
  pivot.

See the
[Variable reassignment](#variable-reassignment) section for more information on how to reassign values to
variables.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Variable declarations

# [Variable declarations](https://www.tradingview.com#variable-declarations)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Variables are [identifiers](#identifiers) that hold values. They must be *declared* in your code
before you use them. The syntax of variable declarations is:

```
[<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = <expression> | <structure>
```

or

```
<tuple_declaration> = <function_call> | <structure>
```

where:

- `|` means "or", and parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can
  appear zero or one time.
- <declaration_mode> is the variable's
  [declaration mode](#declaration-modes). It can be
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  or
  [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip),
  or nothing.
- <type> is a valid *type keyword* with an optional *qualifier prefix*. Specifying a variable's type is optional in most cases. See the [Type system](#type-system) page to learn more.
- <identifier> is the variable's
  [name](#identifiers).
- <expression> can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a
  function call.
- <structure> can be an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if),
  [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for),
  [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while)
  or
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)*structure*.
- <tuple_declaration> is a comma-separated list of variable names
  enclosed in square brackets (`[]`), e.g.,
  `[ma, upperBand, lowerBand]`.

These are all valid variable declarations. Note that the last declaration requires four
lines of code because it uses the returned value from an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement:

```
BULL_COLOR = color.lime
i = 1
len = input(20, "Length")
float f = 10.5
closeRoundedToTick = math.round_to_mintick(close)
sma = ta.sma(close, 14)
var barRange = float(na)
var firstBarOpen = open
varip float lastClose = na
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
plotColor = if close > open
    color.green
else
    color.red
```

The formal syntax of a variable declaration is:

```
<variable_declaration>    [<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = <expression> | <structure>    |    <tuple_declaration> = <function_call> | <structure>
<declaration_mode>    var | varip
<type>    int | float | bool | color | string | line | linefill | label | box | table | polyline | chart.point | array<type> | matrix<type> | map<keyType, valueType> | UDT | Enum
```

### [Initialization with `na`](https://www.tradingview.com#initialization-with-na)

In most cases, an explicit type declaration is redundant because type is
automatically inferred from the value on the right of the `=` at compile
time, so the decision to use them is often a matter of preference. For
example:

```
baseLine0 = na          // compile time error!
float baseLine1 = na    // OK
baseLine2 = float(na)   // OK
```

In the first line of the example, the compiler cannot determine the type
of the `baseLine0` variable because
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) is a
generic value of no particular type. The declaration of the `baseLine1`
variable is correct because its
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
type is declared explicitly. The declaration of the `baseLine2` variable
is also correct because its type can be derived from the expression
`float(na)`, which is an explicit cast of the
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value
to the
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
type. The declarations of `baseLine1` and `baseLine2` are equivalent.

### [Tuple declarations](https://www.tradingview.com#tuple-declarations)

Function calls or structures are allowed to return multiple values. When
we call them and want to store the values they return, a *tuple
declaration* must be used, which is a comma-separated set of one or more
values enclosed in brackets. This allows us to declare multiple
variables simultaneously. As an example, the
[ta.bb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dbb)
built-in function for Bollinger bands returns three values:

```
[bbMiddle, bbUpper, bbLower] = ta.bb(close, 5, 4)
```

### [Using an underscore (​`_`​) as an identifier](https://www.tradingview.com#using-an-underscore-_-as-an-identifier)

When declaring a variable, it is possible to use a single underscore (`_`) as its identifier. A value assigned to such a variable cannot be accessed. You can assign any number of values to a `_` identifier anywhere in the script, even if the current scope already has such an assignment.

This is particularly useful when a tuple returns unneeded values. Let's write another Bollinger Bands script. Here, we only need the bands themselves, without the center line:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Underscore demo")

// We do not need the middle Bollinger Bands value, and do not use it.
// To make this clear, we assign it to the `_` identifier.
[_, bbUpper, bbLower] = ta.bb(close, 5, 4)

// We can continue to use `_` in the same code without causing compilation errors:
[bbMiddleLong, _, _] = ta.bb(close, 20, 2)

plot(bbUpper)
```

## [Variable reassignment](https://www.tradingview.com#variable-reassignment)

A variable reassignment is done using the
[:=](#-reassignment-operator)
reassignment operator. It can only be done after a variable has been
first declared and given an initial value. Reassigning a new value to a
variable is often necessary in calculations, and it is always necessary
when a variable from the global scope must be assigned a new value from
within a structure's local block, e.g.:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
sensitivityInput = input.int(2, "Sensitivity", minval = 1, tooltip = "Higher values make color changes less sensitive.")
ma = ta.sma(close, 20)
maUp = ta.rising(ma, sensitivityInput)
maDn = ta.falling(ma, sensitivityInput)

// On first bar only, initialize color to gray
var maColor = color.gray
if maUp
    // MA has risen for two bars in a row; make it lime.
    maColor := color.lime
else if maDn
    // MA has fallen for two bars in a row; make it fuchsia.
    maColor := color.fuchsia

plot(ma, "MA", maColor, 2)
```

Note that:

- We initialize `maColor` on the first bar only, so it preserves its
  value across bars.
- On every bar, the
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  statement checks if the MA has been rising or falling for the
  user-specified number of bars (the default is 2). When that happens,
  the value of `maColor` must be reassigned a new value from within
  the
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  local blocks. To do this, we use the
  [:=](#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator.
- If we did not use the
  [:=](#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator, the effect would be to initialize
  a new `maColor` local variable which would have the same name as
  that of the global scope, but actually be a very confusing
  independent entity that would persist only for the length of the
  local block, and then disappear without a trace.

All user-defined variables in Pine Script™ are *mutable*, which means
their value can be changed using the
[:=](#-reassignment-operator)
reassignment operator. Assigning a new value to a variable may change
its *type qualifier* (see the page on Pine Script™'s
[type system](#type-system) for more
information). A variable can be assigned a new value as many times as
needed during the script's execution on one bar, so a script can
contain any number of reassignments of one variable. A variable's
[declaration mode](#declaration-modes) determines how new values assigned to a variable will be
saved.

## [Declaration modes](https://www.tradingview.com#declaration-modes)

Understanding the impact that declaration modes have on the behavior of
variables requires prior knowledge of Pine Script™'s
[execution model](#execution-model).

When you declare a variable, if a declaration mode is specified, it must
come first. Three modes can be used:

- "On each bar", when none is specified
- [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
- [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)

### [On each bar](https://www.tradingview.com#on-each-bar)

When no explicit declaration mode is specified, i.e. no
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keyword is used, the variable is declared and initialized on each bar,
e.g., the following declarations from our first set of examples in this
page's introduction:

```
BULL_COLOR = color.lime
i = 1
len = input(20, "Length")
float f = 10.5
closeRoundedToTick = math.round_to_mintick(close)
st = ta.supertrend(4, 14)
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
plotColor = if close > open
    color.green
else
    color.red
```

### [`var`](https://www.tradingview.com#var)

When the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword is used, the variable is only initialized once, on the first bar
if the declaration is in the global scope, or the first time the local
block is executed if the declaration is inside a local block. After
that, it will preserve its last value on successive bars, until we
reassign a new value to it. This behavior is very useful in many cases
where a variable's value must persist through the iterations of a
script across successive bars. For example, suppose we'd like to count
the number of green bars on the chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Green Bars Count")
var count = 0
isGreen = close >= open
if isGreen
    count := count + 1
plot(count)
```

![image](images/GreenBarsCount.Cx1nQdL0_Z2kYId.png)

Without the `var` modifier, variable `count` would be reset to zero
(thus losing its value) every time a new bar update triggered a script
recalculation.

Declaring variables on the first bar only is often useful to manage
drawings more efficiently. Suppose we want to extend the last bar's
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
line to the right of the right chart. We could write:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Inefficient version", "", true)
closeLine = line.new(bar_index - 1, close, bar_index, close, extend = extend.right, width = 3)
line.delete(closeLine[1])
```

but this is inefficient because we are creating and deleting the line on
each historical bar and on each update in the realtime bar. It is more
efficient to use:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Efficient version", "", true)
var closeLine = line.new(bar_index - 1, close, bar_index, close, extend = extend.right, width = 3)
if barstate.islast
    line.set_xy1(closeLine, bar_index - 1, close)
    line.set_xy2(closeLine, bar_index, close)
```

Note that:

- We initialize `closeLine` on the first bar only, using the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  declaration mode
- We restrict the execution of the rest of our code to the chart's
  last bar by enclosing our code that updates the line in an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
  structure.

There is a very slight penalty performance for using the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
declaration mode. For that reason, when declaring constants, it is
preferable not to use
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) if
performance is a concern, unless the initialization involves
calculations that take longer than the maintenance penalty, e.g.,
functions with complex code or string manipulations.

### [`varip`](https://www.tradingview.com#varip)

Understanding the behavior of variables using the
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
declaration mode requires prior knowledge of Pine Script™'s
[execution model](#execution-model) and
[bar states](#bar-states).

The
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keyword can be used to declare variables that escape the *rollback
process*, which is explained in the page on Pine Script™'s
[execution model](#execution-model).

Whereas scripts only execute once at the close of historical bars, when
a script is running in realtime, it executes every time the chart's
feed detects a price or volume update. At every realtime update, Pine
Script™'s runtime normally resets the values of a script's variables
to their last committed value, i.e., the value they held when the
previous bar closed. This is generally handy, as each realtime script
execution starts from a known state, which simplifies script logic.

Sometimes, however, script logic requires code to be able to save
variable values **between different executions** in the realtime bar.
Declaring variables with
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
makes that possible. The "ip" in
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
stands for *intrabar persist*.

Let's look at the following code, which does not use
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip):

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
int updateNo = na
if barstate.isnew
    updateNo := 1
else
    updateNo := updateNo + 1

plot(updateNo, style = plot.style_circles)
```

On historical bars,
[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew)
is always true, so the plot shows a value of "1" because the `else`
part of the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure is never executed. On realtime bars,
[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew)
is only
[true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true)
when the script first executes on the bar's "open". The plot will
then briefly display "1" until subsequent executions occur. On the
next executions during the realtime bar, the second branch of the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
statement is executed because
[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew)
is no longer true. Since `updateNo` is initialized to
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) at
each execution, the `updateNo + 1` expression yields
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), so
nothing is plotted on further realtime executions of the script.

If we now use
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
to declare the `updateNo` variable, the script behaves very differently:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
varip int updateNo = na
if barstate.isnew
    updateNo := 1
else
    updateNo := updateNo + 1

plot(updateNo, style = plot.style_circles)
```

The difference now is that `updateNo` tracks the number of realtime
updates that occur on each realtime bar. This can happen because the
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
declaration allows the value of `updateNo` to be preserved between
realtime updates; it is no longer rolled back at each realtime execution
of the script. The test on
[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew)
allows us to reset the update count when a new realtime bar comes in.

Because
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
only affects the behavior of your code in the realtime bar, it follows
that backtest results on strategies designed using logic based on
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
variables will not be able to reproduce that behavior on historical
bars, which will invalidate test results on them. This also entails that
plots on historical bars will not be able to reproduce the script's
behavior in realtime.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Conditional structures

# [Conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com#conditional-structures)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

The conditional structures in Pine Script™ are
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) and
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch).
They can be used:

- For their side effects, i.e., when they don't return a value but do
  things, like reassign values to variables or call functions.
- To return a value or a tuple which can then be assigned to one (or
  more, in the case of tuples) variable.

Conditional structures, like the
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) and
[while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while)
structures, can be embedded; you can use an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) or
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
inside another structure.

Some Pine Script™ built-in functions are **not** callable from within the
local blocks of conditional structures, including [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor), [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor), [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape), [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar), [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow), [plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle), [plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar), [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline), [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill), [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition), [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), and [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library).

This restriction does not entail their functionality cannot be controlled by
conditions evaluated by your script — only that it cannot be done by
including them in conditional structures. Note that while `input*.()`
function calls are allowed in local blocks, their functionality is the
same as if they were in the script's *global scope*.

The local blocks in conditional structures must be indented by four
spaces or a tab.

## [`if` structure](https://www.tradingview.com#if-structure)

### [`if` used for its side effects](https://www.tradingview.com#if-used-for-its-side-effects)

An [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure used for its side effects has the following syntax:

```
if <expression>    <local_block>{else if <expression>    <local_block>}[else    <local_block>]
```

where:

- Parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one
  time, and those enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) can appear zero or
  more times.
- <expression> must be of "bool" type or be auto-castable to that
  type, which is only possible for "int" or "float" values (see
  the [Type system](#types) page).
- <local_block> consists of zero or more statements followed by a
  return value, which can be a tuple of values. It must be indented by
  four spaces or a tab.
- There can be zero or more `else if` clauses.
- There can be zero or one `else` clause.

When the <expression> following the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
evaluates to
[true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true),
the first local block is executed, the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure's execution ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of
the local block are returned.

When the <expression> following the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
evaluates to
[false](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_false),
the successive `else if` clauses are evaluated, if there are any. When
the <expression> of one evaluates to
[true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true),
its local block is executed, the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure's execution ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of
the local block are returned.

When no <expression> has evaluated to
[true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true)
and an `else` clause exists, its local block is executed, the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure's execution ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of
the local block are returned.

When no <expression> has evaluated to [true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true) and no `else` clause exists, [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) is returned. The only exception to this is if the structure returns "bool" values — in that case, [false](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_false) is returned instead.

Using [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structures for their side effects can be useful to manage the order flow
in strategies, for example. While the same functionality can often be
achieved using the `when` parameter in `strategy.*()` calls, code using
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structures is easier to read:

```
if (ta.crossover(source, lower))
    strategy.entry("BBandLE", strategy.long, stop=lower,
                   oca_name="BollingerBands",
                   oca_type=strategy.oca.cancel, comment="BBandLE")
else
    strategy.cancel(id="BBandLE")
```

Restricting the execution of your code to specific bars ican be done
using [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structures, as we do here to restrict updates to our label to the
chart's last bar:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
var ourLabel = label.new(bar_index, na, na, color = color(na), textcolor = color.orange)
if barstate.islast
    label.set_xy(ourLabel, bar_index + 2, hl2[1])
    label.set_text(ourLabel, str.tostring(bar_index + 1, "# bars in chart"))
```

Note that:

- We initialize the `ourLabel` variable on the script's first bar
  only, as we use the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  declaration mode. The value used to initialize the variable is
  provided by the
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  function call, which returns a label ID pointing to the label it
  creates. We use that call to set the label's properties because
  once set, they will persist until we change them.
- What happens next is that on each successive bar the Pine Script™
  runtime will skip the initialization of `ourLabel`, and the
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  structure's condition
  ([barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast))
  is evaluated. It returns `false` on all bars until the last one, so
  the script does nothing on most historical bars after bar zero.
- On the last bar,
  [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
  becomes true and the structure's local block executes, modifying on
  each chart update the properties of our label, which displays the
  number of bars in the dataset.
- We want to display the label's text without a background, so we
  make the label's background
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  in the
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  function call, and we use `hl2[1]` for the label's *y* position
  because we don't want it to move all the time. By using the average
  of the **previous** bar's
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
  and
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
  values, the label doesn't move until the moment when the next
  realtime bar opens.
- We use `bar_index + 2` in our
  [label.set_xy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_xy)
  call to offset the label to the right by two bars.

### [`if` used to return a value](https://www.tradingview.com#if-used-to-return-a-value)

An [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure used to return one or more values has the following syntax:

```
[<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = if <expression>    <local_block>{else if <expression>    <local_block>}[else    <local_block>]
```

where:

- Parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one
  time, and those enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) can appear zero or
  more times.
- <declaration_mode> is the variable's
  [declaration mode](#declaration-modes)
- <type> is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable
  declarations (see [types](#types))
- <identifier> is the variable's
  [name](#identifiers)
- <expression> can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a
  function call.
- <local_block> consists of zero or more statements followed by a
  return value, which can be a tuple of values. It must be indented by
  four spaces or a tab.
- The value assigned to the variable is the return value of the
  <local_block>, or
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  if no local block is executed. If other local blocks return "bool" values, [false](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_false) will be returned instead.

This is an example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
string barState = if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    "islastconfirmedhistory"
else if barstate.isnew
    "isnew"
else if barstate.isrealtime
    "isrealtime"
else
    "other"

f_print(_text) => 
    var table _t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell(_t, 0, 0, _text, bgcolor = color.yellow)
f_print(barState)
```

It is possible to omit the *else* block. In this case, if the
`condition` is false, an *empty* value (`na`, `false`, or `""`) will be
assigned to the `var_declarationX` variable.

This is an example showing how
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) is
returned when no local block is executed. If `close > open` is `false`
in here,
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) is
returned:

```
x = if close > open
    close
```

Scripts can contain `if` structures with nested `if` and other
conditional structures. For example:

```
if condition1
    if condition2
        if condition3
            expression
```

However, nesting these structures is not recommended from a performance
perspective. When possible, it is typically more optimal to compose a
single `if` statement with multiple logical operators rather than
several nested `if` blocks:

```
if condition1 and condition2 and condition3
    expression
```

## [`switch` structure](https://www.tradingview.com#switch-structure)

The
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure exists in two forms. One switches on the different values of a
key expression:

```
[[<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = ]switch <expression>    {<expression> => <local_block>}    => <local_block>
```

The other form does not use an expression as a key; it switches on the
evaluation of different expressions:

```
[[<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = ]switch    {<expression> => <local_block>}    => <local_block>
```

where:

- Parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one
  time, and those enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) can appear zero or
  more times.
- <declaration_mode> is the variable's
  [declaration mode](#declaration-modes)
- <type> is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable
  declarations (see [types](#types))
- <identifier> is the variable's
  [name](#identifiers)
- <expression> can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a
  function call.
- <local_block> consists of zero or more statements followed by a
  return value, which can be a tuple of values. It must be indented by
  four spaces or a tab.
- The value assigned to the variable is the return value of the
  <local_block>, or
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  if no local block is executed.
- The `=> <local_block>` at the end allows you to specify a return
  value which acts as a default to be used when no other case in the
  structure is executed.

Only one local block of a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure is executed. It is thus a *structured switch* that doesn't
*fall through* cases. Consequently, `break` statements are unnecessary.

Both forms are allowed as the value used to initialize a variable.

As with the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure, if no local block is exectuted,
the expression returns either [false](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_false) (when other local blocks return a "bool" value) or [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) (in all other cases).

### [`switch` with an expression](https://www.tradingview.com#switch-with-an-expression)

Let's look at an example of a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
using an expression:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Switch using an expression", "", true)

string maType = input.string("EMA", "MA type", options = ["EMA", "SMA", "RMA", "WMA"])
int maLength = input.int(10, "MA length", minval = 2)

float ma = switch maType
    "EMA" => ta.ema(close, maLength)
    "SMA" => ta.sma(close, maLength)
    "RMA" => ta.rma(close, maLength)
    "WMA" => ta.wma(close, maLength)
    => 
        runtime.error("No matching MA type found.")
        float(na)

plot(ma)
```

Note that:

- The expression we are switching on is the variable `maType`, which
  is of "input int" type (see here for an explanation of what the
  "[input](#input)" qualifier is). Since it cannot change during the
  execution of the script, this guarantees that whichever MA type the
  user selects will be executing on each bar, which is a requirement
  for functions like
  [ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dema)
  which require a "simple int" argument for their `length`
  parameter.
- If no matching value is found for `maType`, the
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
  executes the last local block introduced by `=>`, which acts as a
  catch-all. We generate a runtime error in that block. We also end it
  with `float(na)` so the local block returns a value whose type is
  compatible with that of the other local blocks in the structure, to
  avoid a compilation error.

### [`switch` without an expression](https://www.tradingview.com#switch-without-an-expression)

This is an example of a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure which does not use an expression:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Switch without an expression", "", true)

bool longCondition  = ta.crossover( ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
bool shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))

switch
    longCondition  => strategy.entry("Long ID", strategy.long)
    shortCondition => strategy.entry("Short ID", strategy.short)
```

Note that:

- We are using the
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
  to select the appropriate strategy order to emit, depending on
  whether the `longCondition` or `shortCondition` "bool" variables
  are `true`.
- The building conditions of `longCondition` and `shortCondition` are
  exclusive. While they can both be `false` simultaneously, they
  cannot be `true` at the same time. The fact that only **one** local
  block of the
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
  structure is ever executed is thus not an issue for us.
- We evaluate the calls to
  [ta.crossover()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dcrossover)
  and
  [ta.crossunder()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dcrossunder)**prior** to entry in the
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
  structure. Not doing so, as in the following example, would prevent
  the functions to be executed on each bar, which would result in a
  compiler warning and erratic behavior:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Switch without an expression", "", true)

switch
    // Compiler warning! Will not calculate correctly!
    ta.crossover( ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28)) => strategy.entry("Long ID", strategy.long)
    ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28)) => strategy.entry("Short ID", strategy.short)
```

## [Matching local block type requirement](https://www.tradingview.com#matching-local-block-type-requirement)

When multiple local blocks are used in structures, the type of the
return value of all its local blocks must match. This applies only if
the structure is used to assign a value to a variable in a declaration,
because a variable can only have one type, and if the statement returns
two incompatible types in its branches, the variable type cannot be
properly determined. If the structure is not assigned anywhere, its
branches can return different values.

This code compiles fine because
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
and
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
are both of the `float` type:

```
x = if close > open
    close
else
    open
```

This code does not compile because the first local block returns a
`float` value, while the second one returns a `string`, and the result
of the `if`-statement is assigned to the `x` variable:

```
// Compilation error!
x = if close > open
    close
else
    "open"
```

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Loops

# [Loops](https://www.tradingview.com#loops)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Loops are structures that repeatedly execute a block of statements based on specified criteria. They allow scripts to perform repetitive tasks without requiring duplicated lines of code. Pine Script™ features three distinct loop types: [for](#for-loops), [while](#while-loops), and [for…in](#forin-loops).

Every loop structure in Pine Script consists of two main parts: a *loop header* and a *loop body*. The loop header determines the criteria under which the loop executes. The loop body is the indented block of code ([local block](#scope)) that the script executes on each loop cycle (*iteration*) as long as the header's conditions remain valid. See the [Common characteristics](#common-characteristics) section to learn more.

Understanding when and how to use loops is essential for making the most of the power of Pine Script. Inefficient or [unnecessary](#when-loops-are-unnecessary) usage of loops can lead to suboptimal runtime performance. However, effectively using loops [when necessary](#when-loops-are-necessary) enables scripts to perform a wide range of calculations that would otherwise be impractical or impossible without them.

### [When loops are unnecessary](https://www.tradingview.com#when-loops-are-unnecessary)

Pine's [execution model](#execution-model) and [time series](#time-series) structure make loops *unnecessary* in many situations.

When a user adds a Pine script to a chart, it runs within the equivalent of a *large loop*, executing its code once on *every* historical bar and realtime tick in the available data. Scripts can access the values from the executions on previous bars with the [history-referencing operator](#--history-referencing-operator), and calculated values can *persist* across executions when assigned to variables declared with the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keywords. These capabilities enable scripts to utilize bar-by-bar calculations to accomplish various tasks instead of relying on explicit loops.

In addition, several [built-ins](#built-ins), such as those in the `ta.*` namespace, are internally optimized to eliminate the need to use loops for various calculations.

Let's consider a simple example demonstrating unnecessary loop usage in Pine Script. To calculate the average [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) over a specified number of bars, newcomers to Pine may write a code like the following, which uses a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to calculate the sum of historical values over `lengthInput` bars and divides the result by the `lengthInput`:

![image](images/Loops-When-loops-are-unnecessary-1.BXNHgEl8_1LIA2B.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Unnecessary loops demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int lengthInput = input.int(defval = 20, title = "Length")

//@variable The sum of `close` values over `lengthInput` bars.
float closeSum = 0

// Loop over the most recent `lengthInput` bars, adding each bar's `close` to the `closeSum`.
for i = 0 to lengthInput - 1
    closeSum += close[i]

//@variable The average `close` value over `lengthInput` bars.
float avgClose = closeSum / lengthInput

// Plot the `avgClose`.
plot(avgClose, "Average close", color.orange, 2)
```

Using a [for](#for-loops) loop is an **unnecessary**, inefficient way to accomplish tasks like this in Pine. There are several ways to utilize the [execution model](#execution-model) and the available built-ins to eliminate this loop. Below, we replaced these calculations with a simple call to the [ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma) function. This code is shorter, and it achieves the same result much more efficiently:

![image](images/Loops-When-loops-are-unnecessary-2.BqNbiiYY_ZoMQmT.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Unnecessary loops corrected demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int lengthInput = input.int(defval = 20, title = "Length")

//@variable The average `close` value over `lengthInput` bars.
float avgClose = ta.sma(close, lengthInput)

// Plot the `avgClose`.
plot(avgClose, "Average close", color.blue, 2)
```

Note that:

- Users can see the substantial difference in efficiency between these two example scripts by analyzing their performance with the [Pine Profiler](#pine-profiler).

### [When loops are necessary](https://www.tradingview.com#when-loops-are-necessary)

Although Pine's [execution model](#execution-model), [time series](#time-series), and available [built-ins](#built-ins) often eliminate the need for loops in many cases, not all iterative tasks have loop-free alternatives. Loops *are necessary* for several types of tasks, including:

- Iterating through or manipulating [collections](#collections) ([arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices), and [maps](#maps))
- Performing calculations that one **cannot** accomplish with loop-free expressions or the available built-ins
- Looking back through history to analyze past bars with a reference value only available on the *current bar*

For example, a loop is *necessary* to identify which past bars' [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) values are above the current bar's [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) because the current value is **not** obtainable during a script's executions on previous bars. The script can only access the current bar's value while it executes on that bar, and it must *look back* through the historical series during that execution to compare the previous values.

The script below uses a [for](#for-loops) loop to compare the [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) values of `lengthInput` previous bars with the last historical bar's [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high). Within the loop, it calls [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) to draw a circular [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) above each past bar that has a [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) value exceeding that of the last historical bar:

![image](images/Loops-When-loops-are-necessary.Bpzukabm_Z288WAS.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Necessary loop demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of previous `high` values to compare to the last historical bar's `high`. 
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1, 500)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Draw a horizontal line segment at the last historical bar's `high` to visualize the level. 
    line.new(bar_index - lengthInput, high, bar_index, high, color = color.gray, style = line.style_dashed, width = 2)
    // Create a `for` loop that counts from 1 to `lengthInput`.
    for i = 1 to lengthInput
        // Draw a circular `label` above the bar from `i` bars ago if that bar's `high` is above the current `high`.
        if high[i] > high
            label.new(
                 bar_index - i, na, "", yloc = yloc.abovebar, color = color.purple, 
                 style = label.style_circle, size = size.tiny
             )

// Highlight the last historical bar.
barcolor(barstate.islastconfirmedhistory ? color.orange : na, title = "Last historical bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- Each *iteration* of the [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop retrieves a previous bar's [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) with the history-referencing operator [[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D), using the loop's *counter* (`i`) as the historical offset. The [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call also uses the counter to determine each label's x-coordinate.
- The [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration statement includes `max_labels_count = 500`, meaning the script can show up to 500 [labels](#labels) on the chart.
- The script calls [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor) to highlight the last historical chart bar, and it draws a horizontal [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) at that bar's [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) for visual reference.

## [Common characteristics](https://www.tradingview.com#common-characteristics)

The [for](#for-loops), [while](#while-loops), and [for…in](#forin-loops) loop statements all have similarities in their structure, syntax, and general behavior. Before we explore each specific loop type, let's familiarize ourselves with these characteristics.

### [Structure and syntax](https://www.tradingview.com#structure-and-syntax)

In any loop statement, programmers define the criteria under which a script remains in a loop and performs *iterations*, where an iteration refers to *one execution* of the code within the loop's [local block](#scope) (*body*). These criteria are part of the *loop header*. A script evaluates the header's criteria *before* each iteration, only allowing new iterations to occur while they remain valid. When the header's criteria are no longer valid, the script *exits* the loop and skips over its body.

The specific header syntax varies with each loop statement ([for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for), [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while), or [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)) because each uses *distinct* criteria to control its iterations. Effective use of loops entails choosing the structure with control criteria best suited for a script's required tasks. See the [`for` loops](#for-loops), [`while` loops](#while-loops), and [`for…in` loops](#forin-loops) sections below for more information on each loop statement and its control criteria.

All loop statements in Pine Script follow the same general syntax:

```
[variables = | :=] loop_header    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where:

- `loop_header` represents the loop structure's header statement, which defines the criteria that control the loop's iterations.
- `statements` represents the code statements and expressions within the loop's body, i.e., the *indented* block of code beneath the loop header. All code within the body belongs to the loop's [local scope](#scope).
- `continue` and `break` are loop-specific *keywords* that control the flow of a loop's iterations. The `continue` keyword instructs the script to *skip* the remainder of the current loop iteration and *continue* to the next iteration. The `break` keyword prompts the script to *stop* the current iteration and *exit* the loop entirely. See [this section](#keywords-and-return-expressions) below for more information.
- `return_expression` refers to the *last* code line or block within the loop's body. The loop returns the results from this code after the final iteration. If the loop skips parts of some iterations or stops prematurely due to a `continue` or `break` statement, the returned values or references are those of the latest iteration that evaluated this code. To use the loop's returned results, assign them to a variable or [tuple](#tuples).
- `variables` represents an optional variable or tuple to hold the values or references from the last evaluation of the `return_expression`. The script can assign the loop's returned results to variables only if the results are not [void](#void). If the loop's conditions prevent iteration, or if no iterations evaluate the `return_expression`, the variables' assigned values and references are [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

### [Scope](https://www.tradingview.com#scope)

All code lines that a script executes within a loop must have an indentation of *four spaces* or a *tab* relative to the loop's header. The indented lines following the header define the loop's *body*. This code represents a *local block*, meaning that all the definitions within the body are accessible only during the loop's execution. In other words, the code within the loop's body is part of its *local scope*.

Scripts can modify and [reassign](#variable-reassignment) most variables from *outer* scopes inside a loop. However, any variables declared within the loop's body strictly belong to that loop's local scope. A script **cannot** access a loop's declared variables *outside* its local block.

Note that:

- Variables declared within a loop's *header* are also part of the local scope. For instance, a script cannot use the *counter variable* in a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop anywhere but within the loop's local block.

The body of any Pine loop statement can include [conditional structures](#conditional-structures) and *nested* loop statements. When a loop includes nested structures, each structure within the body maintains a *distinct* local scope. For example, variables declared within an *outer* loop's scope are accessible to an *inner* loop. However, any variables declared within the inner loop's scope are **not** accessible to the outer loop.

The simple example below demonstrates how a loop's local scope works. This script calls [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) within a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop on the last historical bar to draw [labels](#labels) above `lengthInput` past bars. The color of each label depends on the `labelColor` variable declared *within* the loop's local block, and each label's location depends on the loop counter (`i`):

![image](images/Loops-Common-characteristics-Scope.C3aeQeOf_uwxmQ.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Loop scope demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Lookback length", 1)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    for i = 1 to lengthInput
        //@variable Has a value of `color.blue` if `close[i]` is above the current `close`, `color.orange` otherwise.
        //          This variable is LOCAL to the `for` loop's scope.
        color labelColor = close[i] > close ? color.blue : color.orange
        // Display a colored `label` on the historical `high` from `i` bars back, using `labelColor` to set the color.
        label.new(bar_index - i, high[i], "", color = labelColor, size = size.normal)
```

In the above code, the `i` and `labelColor` variables are only accessible to the [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop's local scope. They are **not** usable within any outer scopes. Here, we added a [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call *after* the loop with `bar_index - i` as the `x` argument and `labelColor` as the `color` argument. This code causes a *compilation error* because neither `i` nor `labelColor` are valid variables in the outer scope:

```
//@version=6

### [Keywords and return expressions](https://www.tradingview.com#keywords-and-return-expressions)

Every loop in Pine Script implicitly *returns* values, references, or [void](#void). A loop's returned results come from the *latest* execution of the *last* expression or nested structure within its body as of the final iteration. The results are usable only if they are not of the [void](#void) type. Loops return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) results for values or references when no iterations occur. Scripts can add a variable or tuple assignment to a loop statement to hold the returned results for use in additional calculations outside the loop's [local scope](#scope).

The values or references that a loop returns usually come from evaluating the last written expression or nested code block on the *final* iteration. However, a loop's body can include `continue` and `break` keywords to control the flow of iterations beyond the criteria the loop header specifies, which can also affect the returned results. Programmers often include these keywords within [conditional structures](#conditional-structures) to control how iterations behave when certain conditions occur.

The `continue` keyword instructs a script to *skip* the remaining statements and expressions in the current loop iteration, re-evaluate the loop header's criteria, and proceed to the *next* iteration. The script *exits* the loop if the header's criteria do not allow another iteration.

The `break` keyword instructs a script to *stop* the loop entirely and immediately *exit* at that point without allowing any subsequent iterations. After breaking the loop, the script skips any remaining code within the loop's body and *does not* re-evaluate the header's criteria.

If a loop skips parts of iterations or stops prematurely due to a `continue` or `break` statement, it returns the values and references from the *last iteration* where the script *evaluated* the return expression. If the script did not evaluate the return expression across *any* of the loop's iterations, the loop returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) results for all non-void types.

The example below selectively displays numbers from an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) on the last historical bar. It uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to iterate through the array's elements and build a "string" to use as the displayed text. The loop's body contains an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement that controls the flow of specific iterations. If the `number` in the current iteration is 8, the script immediately *exits* the loop using the `break` keyword. Otherwise, if the `number` is even, it *skips* the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one using the `continue` keyword.

If neither of the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statement's conditions occur, the script evaluates the *last expression* within the loop's body (i.e., the return expression), which converts the current `number` to a "string" and concatenates the result with the `tempString` value. The loop returns the *last evaluated result* from this expression after termination. The script assigns the returned value to the `finalLabelText` variable and uses that variable as the `text` argument in the [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call:

    string tempString = ""
    //@variable The final text to display in the `label`. The `for..in` loop returns the result after it terminates.
    string finalLabelText = for number in randomArray
        // Stop the current iteration and exit the loop if the `number` from the `randomArray` is 8.
        if number == 8             
            break 
        // Skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration if the `number` is even.   
        else if number % 2 == 0   
            continue
        // Convert the `number` to a "string", append ", ", and concatenate the result with the current `tempString`.
        // This code represents the loop's return expression. 
        tempString += str.tostring(number) + ", "

    // Display the value of the `finalLabelText` within a `label` on the current bar.
    label.new(bar_index, 0, finalLabelText, color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge)
```

Note that:

- The [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) displays only *odd* numbers from the [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) because the script does not reassign the `tempString` when the loop iteration's `number` is even. However, it does not include the *last* odd number from the array (15) because the loop stops when `number == 8`, preventing iteration over the remaining `randomArray` elements.
- When the script exits the loop due to the `break` keyword, the loop's return value becomes the last evaluated result from the `tempString` reassignment expression. In this case, the last time that code executes is on the iteration where `number == 9`.

## [`for` loops](https://www.tradingview.com#for-loops)

The [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop statement creates a *count-controlled* loop, which uses a *counter* variable to manage the iterative executions of its local code block. The counter starts at a predefined initial value, and the loop increments or decrements the counter by a fixed amount after each iteration. The loop stops its iterations after the counter reaches a specified final value.

Pine Script uses the following syntax to define a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop:

```
[variables = | :=] for counter = from_num to to_num [by step_num]    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where the following parts define the *loop header*:

- `counter` represents the counter variable, which can be any valid identifier. The loop increments or decrements this variable's value from the initial value (`from_num`) to the final value (`to_num`) by a fixed amount (`step_num`) after each iteration. The last possible iteration occurs when the variable's value reaches the `to_num` value.
- `from_num` is the `counter` variable's initial value on the first iteration.
- `to_num` is the *final*`counter` value for which the loop's header allows a new iteration. The loop adjusts the `counter` value by the `step_num` amount until it reaches or passes this value. If the script modifies the `to_num` during a loop iteration, the loop header uses the new value to control the allowed subsequent iterations.
- `step_num` is a positive value representing the amount by which the `counter` value increases or decreases until it reaches or passes the `to_num` value. If the `from_num` value is greater than the *initial*`to_num` value, the loop *subtracts* this amount from the `counter` value after each iteration. Otherwise, the loop *adds* this amount after each iteration. The default is 1.

Refer to the [Common characteristics](#common-characteristics) section above for detailed information about the `variables`, `statements`, `continue`, `break`, and `return_expression` parts of the loop's syntax.

This simple script demonstrates a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop that draws several [labels](#labels) at future bar indices during its execution on the last historical chart bar. The loop's counter starts at 0, then increases by 1 until it reaches a value of 10, at which point the final iteration occurs:

![image](images/Loops-For-loops-1.JEmTwodf_Zk2Mts.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Simple `for` loop demo")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Define a `for` loop that iterates from `i == 0` to `i == 10` by 1 (11 total iterations).
    for i = 0 to 10
        // Draw a new label `i` bars ahead of the current bar.  
        label.new(bar_index + i, 0, str.tostring(i), textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
```

Note that:

- The `i` variable represents the loop's *counter*. This variable is local to the loop's [scope](#scope), meaning no *outer scopes* can access it. The code uses the variable within the loop's body to determine the location and text of each [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) drawing.
- Programmers often use `i`, `j`, and `k` as loop counter identifiers. However, *any* valid variable name is allowed. For example, this code behaves the same if we name the counter `offset` instead of `i`.
- The [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop structure *automatically* manages the counter variable. We do not need to define code in the loop's body to increment its value.

The direction in which a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop adjusts its counter depends on the *initial*`from_num` and `to_num` values in the loop's header, and the direction does not change across iterations. The loop counts *upward* after each iteration when the `to_num` value is *above* the `from_num` value, as shown in the previous example. If the `to_num` value is *below* the `from_num` value, the loop counts *downward* instead.

The script below calculates and plots the [volume-weighted moving average (VWMA)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592293-volume-weighted-moving-average-vwma/) of [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) prices across a specified number of bars. Then, it uses a downward-counting [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to compare the last historical bar's value to the values from previous bars, starting with the oldest bar in the specified lookback window. On each loop iteration, the script retrieves a previous bar's `vwmaOpen` value, calculates the difference from the current bar's value, and displays the result in a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) at the past bar's opening price:

//@variable The number of past bars to look back through and compare to the current bar.
int lookbackInput = input.int(15, "Lookback length", 1, 500)

//@variable The volume-weighted moving average of `open` values over `maLengthInput` bars. 
float vwmaOpen = ta.vwma(open, maLengthInput)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Define a `for` loop that counts *downward* from `i == lookbackInput` to `i == 1`. 
    for i = lookbackInput to 1
        //@variable The difference between the `vwmaOpen` from `i` bars ago and the current `vwmaOpen`.
        float vwmaDifference = vwmaOpen[i] - vwmaOpen
        //@variable A "string" representation of `vwmaDifference`, rounded to two fractional digits. 
        string displayText = (vwmaDifference > 0 ? "+" : "") + str.tostring(vwmaDifference, "0.00")
        // Draw a label showing the `displayText` at the `open` of the bar from `i` bars back.
        label.new(
             bar_index - i, open[i], displayText, textcolor = color.white, color = DISPLAY_COLOR,
             style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.normal
         )

// Plot the `vwmaOpen` value.
plot(vwmaOpen, "VWMA", color = DISPLAY_COLOR, linewidth = 2)
```

Note that:

- The script uses the loop's counter (`i`) to within the [history-referencing operator](#--history-referencing-operator) to retrieve past values of the `vwmaOpen` series. It also uses the counter to determine the location of each [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) drawing.
- The loop in this example *decreases* the counter by one on each iteration because the final counter value in the loop's header (`1`) is less than the starting value (`lookbackInput`).

Programmers can use [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops to iterate through [collections](#collections), such as [arrays](#arrays) and [matrices](#matrices). The loop's counter can serve as an *index* for retrieving or modifying a collection's contents. For example, this code block uses [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get) inside a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to successively retrieve elements from an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array):

```
int lastIndex = array.size(myArray) - 1
for i = 0 to lastIndex
   element = array.get(i)
```

Note that:

- Array *indexing* starts from 0, but the [array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) function *counts* array elements starting from 1. Therefore, we must subtract 1 from the array's size to get the maximum index value. This way, the loop counter avoids representing an [out-of-bounds](#index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-array-size-is-yy) index on the last loop iteration.
- The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement is often the *preferred* way to loop through [collections](#collections). However, programmers may prefer a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop for some tasks, such as looping through stepped index values, iterating over a collection's contents in reverse or a nonlinear order, and more. See the [Looping through arrays](#looping-through-arrays) and [Looping through matrices](#looping-through-matrices) sections to learn more about the best practices for looping through these collection types.

The script below calculates the [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi) and [momentum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.mom) of [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices over three different lengths (10, 20, and 50) and displays their values within a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the last chart bar. It stores "string" values for the header title within [arrays](#arrays) and the "float" values of the calculated indicators within a 2x3 [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix). The script uses a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to access the elements in the arrays and initialize the `displayTable` header cells. It then uses *nested*[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops to iterate over the *row* and *column* indices in the `taMatrix`, access elements, convert their values to strings, and populate the remaining table cells:

             )
```

Note that:

- Both [arrays](#arrays) of header names (`sideHeaderTitles` and `topHeaderTitles`) contain the same number of elements, which allows the script to iterate through their contents simultaneously using a single [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop.
- The nested [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops iterate over *all* the index values in the `taMatrix`. The *outer* loop iterates over each *row* index, and the *inner* loop iterates over every *column* index on each outer loop iteration.
- The script creates and displays the [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) only on the last historical bar and all realtime bars because the historical states of [tables](#tables) are *never* visible. See [this section](#reducing-drawing-updates) of the [Profiling and optimization](#profiling-and-optimization) page for more information.

It's important to note that a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop's header *dynamically* evaluates the `to_num` value at the start of *every iteration*. If the `to_num` argument is a variable and the script changes its value during an iteration, the loop uses the *new value* to update its stopping condition. Likewise, the stopping condition can change across iterations when the `to_num` argument is an expression or function call that depends on data modified in the loop's scope, such as a call to [array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) on a locally resized [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) or [str.length()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.length) on an adjusted "string". Therefore, scripts can use [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops to perform iterative tasks where the exact number of required iterations is *not predictable* in advance, similar to [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loops.

For example, the following script uses a dynamic [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to determine the historical offset of the most recent bar whose [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) differs from the current bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) by at least one standard deviation. The script declares a `barOffset` variable with an initial value of zero and uses that variable to define the loop counter's `to_num` boundary. Within the loop's scope, the script increments the `barOffset` by one if the referenced bar's `close` is not far enough from the current bar's value. Each time the `barOffset` value increases, the loop increases its final counter value, allowing an *extra iteration*. The script plots the `barOffset` and the corresponding bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) for visual reference:

![image](images/Loops-For-loops-4.28vao8At_zHcik.png)

```
//@version=6 
indicator("`for` loop with dynamic `to_num` demo")

//@variable The length of the standard deviation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1, 4999)

//@variable The standard deviation of `close` prices over `lengthInput` bars. 
float stdev = ta.stdev(close, lengthInput)

//@variable The minimum bars back where the past bar's `close` differs from the current `close` by at least `stdev`.
//          Used as the weight value in the weighted average.  
int barOffset = 0

// Define a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to `barsBack`.
for i = 0 to barOffset
    // Add 1 for each bar where the distance from that bar's `close` to the current bar's `close` is less than `stdev`.
    // Each time `barsBack` increases, it changes the loop's `to_num` boundary, allowing another iteration.  
    barOffset += math.abs(close - close[i]) < stdev ? 1 : 0

//@variable A gradient color for the `barOffset` plot. 
color offsetColor = color.from_gradient(barOffset, 0, lengthInput, color.blue, color.orange)

// Plot the `barOffset` in a separate pane. 
plot(barOffset, "Bar offset", offsetColor, 1, plot.style_columns)
// Plot the historical `close` price from `barOffset` bars back in the main chart pane.
plot(close[barOffset], "Historical bar's price", color.blue, 3, force_overlay = true)
```

Note that:

- Changing the `to_num` value on an iteration does not affect the established *direction* in which the loop adjusts its counter variable. For instance, if the loop in this example changed `barOffset` to -1 on any iteration, it would stop immediately after that iteration ends without reducing the `i` value.
- The script uses `force_overlay = true` in the second [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call to display the historical closing price on the main chart pane.

## [`while` loops](https://www.tradingview.com#while-loops)

The [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop statement creates a *condition-controlled* loop, which uses a *conditional expression* to control the executions of its local block. The loop continues its iterations as long as the specified condition remains `true`.

Pine Script uses the following syntax to define a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop:

```
[variables = | :=] while condition    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where the `condition` in the loop's *header* can be a literal, variable, expression, or function call that returns a "bool" value.

Refer to the [Common characteristics](#common-characteristics) section above for detailed information about the `variables`, `statements`, `continue`, `break`, and `return_expression` parts of the loop's syntax.

A [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop's header evaluates its `condition` before each iteration. Consequently, when the script modifies the condition within an iteration, the loop's header reflects those changes on the *next* iteration.

Depending on the specified condition in the loop header, a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop can behave similarly to a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop, continuing iteration until a *counter* variable reaches a specified limit. For example, the following script uses a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop and [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop to perform the same task. Both loops draw a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) displaying their respective counter value on each iteration:

         )
        // Update the `j` counter within the local block.
        j += 1
```

Note that:

- When a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop uses count-based logic, it must explicitly manage the user-specified counter within the local block. In contrast, a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop increments its counter automatically.
- The script declares the variable the [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop uses as a counter *outside* the loop's [scope](#scope), meaning its value is usable in additional calculations after the loop terminates.
- If this code did not increment the `j` variable within the [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop's body, the value would *never* reach 10, meaning the loop would run *indefinitely* until causing a [runtime error](#loop-is-too-long--500-ms).

Because a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop's execution depends on its condition remaining `true`, and the condition might not change on a specific iteration, the *precise* number of expected iterations might not be knowable *before* the loop begins. Therefore, [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loops are often helpful in scenarios where the exact loop boundaries are *unknown*.

The script below tracks when the chart's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) crosses outside Keltner Channels with a user-specified length and channel width. When the price crosses outside the current bar's channel, the script draws a [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box) highlighting all the previous *consecutive* bars with [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values within that price window. The script uses a [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop to analyze past bars' prices and incrementally adjust the left side of each new [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box) until the drawing covers all the latest consecutive bars in the current range:

![image](images/Loops-While-loops-2.CDUKt8KX_JSuga.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`while` loop demo", "Price window boxes", true)

//@variable The length of the channel.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Channel length", 1, 4999)
//@variable The width multiplier of the channel. 
float widthInput = input.float(2.0, "Width multiplier", 0)

//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar EMA of `close` prices.
float ma = ta.ema(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar ATR, multiplied by the `widthInput`.
float atr = ta.atr(lengthInput) * widthInput
//@variable The lower bound of the channel.
float channelLow = ma - atr
//@variable The upper bound of the channel. 
float channelHigh = ma + atr

//@variable Is `true` when the `close` price is outside the current channel range, `false` otherwise. 
bool priceOutsideChannel = close < channelLow or close > channelHigh

// Check if the `close` crossed outside the channel range, then analyze the past bars within the current range. 
if priceOutsideChannel and not priceOutsideChannel[1]
    //@variable A box that highlights consecutive past bars within the current channel's price window.  
    box windowBox = box.new(
         bar_index, channelHigh, bar_index, channelLow, border_width = 2, bgcolor = color.new(color.gray, 85)
     )
    //@variable The lookback index for box adjustment. The `while` loop increments this value on each iteration. 
    int i = 1
    // Use a `while` loop to look backward through close` prices. The loop iterates as long as the past `close` 
    // from `i` bars ago is between the current bar's `channelLow` and `channelHigh`. 
    while close[i] >= channelLow and close[i] <= channelHigh
        // Adjust the left side of the box. 
        windowBox.set_left(bar_index - i)
        // Add 1 to the `i` value to check the `close` from the next bar back on the next iteration. 
        i += 1

// Plot the `channelLow` and `channelHigh` for visual reference. 
plot(channelLow, "Channel low")
plot(channelHigh, "Channel high")
```

Note that:

- The left and right edges of [boxes](#boxes) sit within the horizontal *center* of their respective bars, meaning that each drawing spans from the middle of the first consecutive bar to the middle of the last bar within each window.
- This script uses the `i` variable as a [history-referencing](#--history-referencing-operator) index within the *conditional expression* the [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop checks on each iteration. The variable **does not** behave as a loop counter, as the iteration boundaries are **unknown**. The loop executes its local block repeatedly until the condition becomes `false`.

## [`for…in` loops](https://www.tradingview.com#forin-loops)

The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement creates a *collection-controlled* loop, which uses the *contents* of a [collection](#collections) to control its iterations. This loop structure is often the preferred approach for looping through [arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices), and [maps](#maps).

A [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop traverses a collection *in order*, retrieving one of its stored items on each iteration. Therefore, the loop's boundaries depend directly on the number of *items* ([array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)*elements*, [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix)*rows*, or [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)*key-value pairs*).

Pine Script features *two* general forms of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement. The *first form* uses the following syntax:

```
[variables = | :=] for item in collection_id    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where `item` is a *variable* that holds sequential values or references from the specified `collection_id`. The variable starts with the collection's *first item* and takes on successive items in order after each iteration. This form is convenient when a script must access values from an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) or [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) iteratively but does not require the item's *index* in its calculations.

The *second form* has a slightly different syntax that includes a [tuple](#tuples) in its *header*:

```
[variables = | :=] for [index, item] in collection_id    statements | continue | break    return_expression
```

Where `index` is a variable that contains the *index* or *key* of the retrieved `item`. This form is convenient when a task requires using a collection's items *and* their indices in iterative calculations. This form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is *required* when directly iterating through the contents of a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map). See [this section](#looping-through-maps) below for more information.

Refer to the [Common characteristics](#common-characteristics) section above for detailed information about the `variables`, `statements`, `continue`, `break`, and `return_expression` parts of the loop's syntax.

The iterative behavior of a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop depends on the *type* of collection the header specifies as the `collection_id`:

- When using an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) in the header, the loop performs [*element-wise* iteration](#looping-through-arrays), meaning the retrieved `item` on each iteration is one of the array's *elements*.
- When using a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) in the header, the loop performs [*row-wise* iteration](#looping-through-matrices), which means that each `item` represents a *row array*.
- When using a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) in the header, the loop performs [*pair-wise* iteration](#looping-through-maps), which retrieves a *key* and corresponding *value* on each iteration.

### [Looping through arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#looping-through-arrays)

Pine scripts can iterate over the elements of [arrays](#arrays) using any loop structure. However, the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is typically the most convenient because it automatically verifies the size of an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) when controlling iterations. With other loop structures, programmers must carefully set the header's boundaries or conditions to *prevent* the loop from attempting to access an element at a *nonexistent* index.

For example, a [for](#for-loops) loop can access an array's elements using the counter variable as the lookup index in functions such as [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get). However, programmers must ensure the counter always represents a *valid index* to prevent [out-of-bounds](#index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-array-size-is-yy) errors. Additionally, if an array might be *empty*, programmers must set conditions to prevent the loop's execution entirely.

The code below shows a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop whose counter boundaries depend on the number of elements in an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array). If the array is empty, containing zero elements, the header's final counter value is [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), which *prevents* iteration. Otherwise, the final value is *one less* than the array's [size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) (i.e., the index of the last element):

```
for index = 0 to (array.size(myArray) == 0 ? na : array.size(myArray) - 1)
    element = array.get(myArray, index)
```

In contrast, a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop automatically validates an array's size and *directly* accesses its elements, providing a more convenient solution than a traditional [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop. The line below achieves the *same effect* as the code above without requiring the programmer to define boundaries explicitly or use the [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get) function to access each element:

```
for element in myArray
```

The following example examines bars on a lower timeframe to gauge the strength of *intrabar* trends within each chart bar. The script uses a [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) call to retrieve an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of intrabar [hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2) prices from a calculated `lowerTimeframe`. Then, it uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to access each `price` within the `intrabarPrices` array and compare the value to the current [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) to calculate the bar's `strength`. The script plots the `strength` as columns in a separate pane:

![image](images/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-arrays-1.D-rbYJQk_ZdCBAV.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`for element in array` demo", "Intrabar strength")

//@variable A valid timeframe closest to one-tenth of the current chart's timeframe, "1" if the timeframe is too small.
var string lowerTimeframe = timeframe.from_seconds(math.max(int(timeframe.in_seconds() / 10), 60))
//@variable An array of intrabar `hl2` prices calculated from the `lowerTimeframe`.
array<float> intrabarPrices = request.security_lower_tf("", lowerTimeframe, hl2)

//@variable The excess trend strength of `intrabarPrices`. 
float strength = 0.0

// Loop directly through the `intrabarPrices` array. Each iteration's `price` represents an array element.
for price in intrabarPrices
    // Subtract 1 from the `strength` if the retrieved `price` is above the current bar's `close` price. 
    if price > close
        strength -= 1
    // Add 1 to the `strength` if the retrieved `price` is below the current bar's `close` price. 
    else if price < close
        strength += 1

//@variable Is `color.teal` when the `strength` is positive, `color.maroon` otherwise.
color strengthColor = strength > 0 ? color.teal : color.maroon

// Plot the `strength` as columns colored by the `strengthColor`.
plot(strength, "Intrabar strength", strengthColor, 1, plot.style_columns)
```

The [second form](#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is a convenient solution when a script's calculations require accessing each element *and* corresponding index within an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array):

```
for [index, element] in myArray
```

For example, suppose we want to display a *numerated* list of [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) elements within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) while excluding values at specific indices. We can use the second form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop structure to accomplish this task. The simple script below declares a `stringArray` variable that references an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of predefined "string" values. On the last historical bar, the script uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to access each `index` and `element` in the `stringArray` to construct the `labelText`, which it uses in a [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call after the loop ends:

![image](images/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-arrays-2.CVOFB_ZV_Z20I1Ef.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`for [index, item] in array` demo", "Array numerated output")

//@variable An array of "string" values to display as a numerated list.
var array<string> stringArray = array.from("First", "Second", "Third", "Before Last", "Last")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A "string" modified within a loop to display within the `label`.
    string labelText = "Array values: \n"
    // Loop through the `stringArray`, accessing each `index` and corresponding `element`. 
    for [index, element] in stringArray
        // Skip the third `element` (at `index == 2`) in the `labelText`. Include an "ELEMENT SKIPPED" message instead. 
        if index == 2
            labelText += "-- ELEMENT SKIPPED -- \n"
            continue
        labelText += str.tostring(index + 1) + ": " + element + "\n"
    // Display the `labelText` within a `label`.
    label.new(
         bar_index, 0, labelText, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge, 
         style = label.style_label_center, textalign = text.align_left
     )
```

Note that:

- This example adds 1 to the `index` in the [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring) call to start the numerated list with a value of `"1"`, because [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) indices always begins at 0.
- On the *third* loop iteration, when `index == 2`, the script adds an `"-- ELEMENT SKIPPED --"` message to the `labelText` instead of the retrieved `element` and uses the `continue` keyword to skip the remainder of the iteration. See [this section](#keywords-and-return-expressions) above to learn more about loop keywords.

Let's explore an advanced example demonstrating the utility of [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loops. The following indicator draws a fixed number of horizontal [lines](#lines) at calculated [pivot high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.pivothigh) levels, and it analyzes the lines within a loop to determine which ones represent active (*uncrossed*) pivots.

Each time the script detects a new pivot high point, it creates a new [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line), *inserts* that line at the beginning of the `pivotLines` array, then removes the oldest element and [deletes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete) its ID. The script accesses each [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) within the [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) using a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop, analyzing and [modifying](#modifying-lines) the properties of the `pivotLine` retrieved on each iteration. When the current [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) crosses above the `pivotLine`, the script changes its style to signify that it is no longer an active level. Otherwise, it extends the line's `x2` coordinate and uses its [price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_price) to calculate the average *active* pivot value. The script also plots each pivot high value and the average active pivot for visual reference:

![image](images/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-arrays-3.92QH6mmE_Z1GaAhA.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`for...in` loop with arrays demo", "Active high pivots", true, max_lines_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars required on the left and right to confirm a pivot point. 
int pivotBarsInput = input.int(5, "Pivot leg length", 1)
//@variable The number of recent pivot lines to analyze. Controls the size of the `pivotLines` array.
int maxRecentLines = input.int(20, "Maximum recent lines", 1, 500)

//@variable An array that acts as a queue holding the most recent pivot high lines. 
var array<line> pivotLines = array.new<line>(maxRecentLines)
//@variable The pivot high price, or `na` if no pivot is found.
float highPivotPrice = ta.pivothigh(pivotBarsInput, pivotBarsInput)

if not na(highPivotPrice)
    //@variable The `chart.point` for the start of the line. Does not contain `time` information.
    firstPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index - pivotBarsInput, highPivotPrice)
    //@variable The `chart.point` for the end of each line. Does not contain `time` information.
    secondPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index, highPivotPrice)
    //@variable A horizontal line at the new pivot level. 
    line hiPivotLine = line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, width = 2, color = color.green) 
    // Insert the `hiPivotLine` at the beginning of the `pivotLines` array.
    pivotLines.unshift(hiPivotLine)
    // Remove the oldest line from the array and delete its ID.
    line.delete(pivotLines.pop())

//@variable The sum of active pivot prices.
float activePivotSum = 0.0
//@variable The number of active pivot high levels.
int numActivePivots = 0

// Loop through the `pivotLines` array, directly accessing each `pivotLine` element. 
for pivotLine in pivotLines
    //@variable The `x2` coordinate of the `pivotline`.
    int lineEnd = pivotLine.get_x2()
    // Move to the next `pivotline` in the array if the current line is inactive.
    if pivotLine.get_x2() < bar_index - 1
        continue
    //@variable The price value of the `pivotLine`.
    float pivotPrice = pivotLine.get_price(bar_index)
    // Change the style of the `pivotLine` and stop extending its display if the `high` is above the `pivotPrice`.
    if high > pivotPrice
        pivotLine.set_color(color.maroon)
        pivotLine.set_style(line.style_dotted)
        pivotLine.set_width(1)
        continue
    // Extend the `pivotLine` and add the `pivotPrice` to the `activePivotSum` when the loop allows a full iteration.
    pivotLine.set_x2(bar_index)
    activePivotSum  += pivotPrice
    numActivePivots += 1

//@variable The average active pivot high value.
float avgActivePivot = activePivotSum / numActivePivots

// Plot crosses at the `highPivotPrice`, offset backward by the `pivotBarsInput`.
plot(highPivotPrice, "High pivot marker", color.green, 3, plot.style_cross, offset = -pivotBarsInput)
// Plot the `avgActivePivot` as a line with breaks.
plot(avgActivePivot, "Avg. active pivot", color.orange, 3, plot.style_linebr)
```

Note that:

- The loop in this example executes on *every bar* because it has to compare each active `pivotLine`'s price with the current [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) value, and it uses the prices to calculate the `avgActivePivot` on each bar.
- Pine Script features several ways to calculate averages, many of which *do not* require a loop. However, a loop is [necessary](#when-loops-are-necessary) in this example because the script uses information only available on the **current bar** to determine which prices contribute toward the average.
- The *first* form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is the most convenient option in this example because we need direct access to the [lines](#lines) within the `pivotLines` array, but we do not need the corresponding *index* values.

### [Looping through matrices](https://www.tradingview.com#looping-through-matrices)

Pine scripts can iterate over the contents of a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) in several different ways. Unlike [arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices) use *two* indices to reference their elements because they store data in a *rectangular* format. The first index refers to *rows*, and the second refers to *columns*. If a programmer opts to use [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) or [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loops to iterate through [matrices](#matrices) instead of using [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in), they must carefully define the loop boundaries or conditions to avoid [out-of-bounds](#the-rowcolumn-index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-rowcolumn-size-is-yy) errors.

This code block shows a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop that performs *row-wise* iteration, looping through each *row index* in a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) and using the value in a [matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row) call to retrieve a row [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array). If the [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) is empty, the loop statement uses a final loop counter value of [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) to *prevent* iteration. Otherwise, the final counter is *one less* than the [row count](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows), which represents the *last* row index:

```
for rowIndex = 0 to (myMatrix.rows() == 0 ? na : myMatrix.rows() - 1)
    rowArray = myMatrix.row(rowIndex)
```

Note that:

- If we replace the [matrix.rows()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows) and [matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row) calls with [matrix.columns()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.columns) and [matrix.col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.col), the loop performs *column-wise* iteration instead.

The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement is the more convenient approach to loop over and access the rows of a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) in order, as it automatically validates the number of rows and retrieves an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of the current row's elements on each iteration:

```
for rowArray in myMatrix
```

When a script's calculations require access to each row from a matrix and its corresponding *index*, programmers can use the [second form](#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop:

```
for [rowIndex, rowArray] in myMatrix
```

Note that:

- The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop only performs **row-wise** iteration on [matrices](#matrices). To *emulate* column-wise iteration, programmers can use a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop on a [transposed copy](#transposing).

The following example displays a custom "string" representing the rows of a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) with extra information, which it displays within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label). When the script executes on the last historical bar, it creates a 3x3 `randomMatrix` populated with [random](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random) values. Then, using the [first form](#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop, the script iterates through each `row` in the `randomMatrix` to create a "string" representing the row's contents, its [average](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg), and whether the average is above 0.5, and it concatenates that "string" with the `labelText`. After the loop ends, the script creates a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) displaying the `labelText` value:

![image](images/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-matrices-1.MLIBFwlx_ZsMuB0.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`for row in matrix` demo", "Custom matrix label")

//@variable Generates a random value between 0 and 1, rounded to 4 decimal places. 
rand() =>
    math.round(math.random(), 4)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A matrix of randomized values to format and display in a `label`. 
    matrix<float> randomMatrix = matrix.new<float>()
    // Add a row of 9 randomized values and reshape the matrix to 3x3.
    randomMatrix.add_row(
         0, array.from(rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand(), rand())
     )
    randomMatrix.reshape(3, 3)

    //@variable A custom "string" representation of `randomMatrix` information. Modified within a loop.
    string labelText = "Matrix rows: \n"

    // Loop through the rows in the `randomMatrix`.
    for row in randomMatrix
        //@variable The average element value within the `row`.
        float rowAvg = row.avg()
        //@variable An upward arrow when the `rowAvg` is above 0.5, a downward arrow otherwise.
        string directionChar = rowAvg > 0.5 ? "⬆" : "⬇"
        // Add a "string" representing the `row` array, its average, and the `directionChar` to the `labelText`.
        labelText += str.format("Row: {0} Avg: {1} {2}\n", row, rowAvg, directionChar)

    // Draw a `label` displaying the `labelText` on the current bar.
    label.new(
         bar_index, 0, labelText, color = color.purple, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge, 
         style = label.style_label_center, textalign = text.align_left
     )
```

Working with [matrices](#matrices) often entails iteratively accessing their *elements*, not just their rows and columns, typically using *nested loops*. For example, this code block uses an outer [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to iterate over row indices. The inner [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop iterates over column indices on *each* outer loop iteration and calls [matrix.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.get) to access an element:

```
for rowIndex = 0 to (myMatrix.rows() == 0 ? na : myMatrix.rows() - 1)
    for columnIndex = 0 to myMatrix.columns() - 1
        element = myMatrix.get(rowIndex, columnIndex)
```

Alternatively, a more convenient approach for this type of task is to use nested [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loops. The outer [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop in this code block retrieves each row [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) in a [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix), and the inner [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) statement [loops through that array](#looping-through-arrays):

```
for rowArray in myMatrix
    for element in rowArray
```

The script below creates a 3x2 [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix), then accesses and modifies its elements within nested [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loops. Both loops use the [second form](#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) statement to retrieve index values and corresponding items. The outer loop accesses a row index and row [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) from the [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix). The inner loop accesses each index and respective element from that [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).

Within the nested loop's iterations, the script converts each `element` to a "string" and initializes a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) cell at the `rowIndex` row and `colIndex` column. Then, it uses the loop header variables within [matrix.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.set) to update the [matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) element. After the outer loop terminates, the script displays a "string" representation of the *updated*[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix) within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label):

![image](images/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-matrices-2.CZ4aQPdE_2aLlhM.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Nested `for...in` loops on matrices demo")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable  A matrix containing numbers to display.
    matrix<float> displayNumbers = matrix.new<float>()
    // Populate the `displayNumbers` matrix and reshape to 3x2.
    displayNumbers.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))
    displayNumbers.reshape(3, 2)

    //@variable A table that displays the elements of the `displayNumbers` before modification. 
    table displayTable = table.new(
         position = position.middle_center, columns = displayNumbers.columns(), rows = displayNumbers.rows(), 
         bgcolor = color.purple, border_color = color.white, border_width = 2
     )

    // Loop through the `displayNumbers`, retrieving the `rowIndex` and the current `row`. 
    for [rowIndex, row] in displayNumbers
        // Loop through the current `row` on each outer loop iteration to retrieve the `colIndex` and `element`.
        for [colIndex, element] in row
            // Initialize a table cell at the `rowIndex` row and `colIndex` column displaying the current `element`.
            displayTable.cell(column = colIndex, row = rowIndex, text = str.tostring(element), 
                 text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge
             )
            // Update the `displayNumbers` value at the `rowIndex` and `colIndex`.
            displayNumbers.set(rowIndex, colIndex, math.round(math.exp(element), 3))

    // Draw a `label` to display a "string" representation of the updated `displayNumbers` matrix. 
    label.new( 
         x = bar_index, y = 0, text = "Matrix now modified: \n" + str.tostring(displayNumbers), color = color.orange, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge, style = label.style_label_up 
     )
```

### [Looping through maps](https://www.tradingview.com#looping-through-maps)

The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement is the primary, most convenient approach for iterating over the data within Pine Script [maps](#maps).

Unlike [arrays](#arrays) and [matrices](#matrices), maps are *unordered collections* that store data in *key-value pairs*. Rather than traversing an internal lookup index, a script references the *keys* from the pairs within a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) to access its *values*. Therefore, when looping through a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map), scripts must perform *pair-wise* iteration, which entails retrieving key-value pairs across iterations rather than indexed [elements](#looping-through-arrays) or [rows](#looping-through-matrices).

Note that:

- Although [maps](#maps) are unordered collections, Pine Script internally tracks the *insertion order* of their key-value pairs.

One way to access the data from a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) is to use the [map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys) function, which returns an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) containing all the *keys* from the map, sorted in their insertion order. A script can use the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) structure to [loop through the array](#looping-through-arrays) of keys and call [map.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.get) to retrieve corresponding values:

```
for key in myMap.keys()
    value = myMap.get(key)
```

However, the more convenient, *recommended* approach is to loop through a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) directly *without* creating new [arrays](#arrays). To loop through a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) directly, use the [second form](#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement. Using this loop with a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) creates a [tuple](#tuples) containing a *key* and respective *value* on each iteration. As when looping through a [map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys) array, this *direct*[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop iterates through a map's contents in their insertion order:

```
for [key, value] in myMap
```

Note that:

- The second form of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop is the **only** way to iterate *directly* through a map. A script cannot directly loop through this collection type without retrieving a key and value on each iteration.

Let's consider a simple example demonstrating how a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop works on a [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map). When the script below executes on the last historical bar, it declares a `simpleMap` variable with an assigned [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map) of "string" keys and "float" values. The script [puts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put) the keys from the `newKeys` array into the collection with corresponding [random](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random) values. It then uses a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to iterate through the key-value pairs from the `simpleMap` and construct the `displayText`. After the loop ends, the script shows the `displayText` within a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) to visualize the result:

![image](images/Loops-For-in-loops-Looping-through-maps.CZTQ1Hx7_Z1jyX7b.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Looping through map demo")

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A map of "string" keys and "float" values to render within a `label`.
    map<string, float> simpleMap = map.new<string, float>()

    //@variable An array of "string" values representing the keys to put into the map. 
    array<string> newKeys = array.from("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
    // Put key-value pairs into the `simpleMap`. 
    for key in newKeys
        simpleMap.put(key, math.random(1, 20))

    //@variable A "string" representation of the `simpleMap` contents. Modified within a loop. 
    string displayText = "simpleMap content: \n "

    // Loop through each key-value pair within the `simpleMap`. 
    for [key, value] in simpleMap
        // Add a "string" representation of the pair to the `displayText`.
        displayText += key + ": " + str.tostring(value, "#.##") + "\n "

    // Draw a `label` showing the `displayText` on the current bar. 
    label.new( 
         x = bar_index, y = 0, text = displayText, color = color.green, textcolor = color.white, 
         size = size.huge, textalign = text.align_left, style = label.style_label_center
     )
```

Note that:

- This script utilizes [both forms](#forin-loops) of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement. The first loop iterates through the "string" elements of the `newKeys` array to put key-value pairs into the `simpleMap`, and the second iterates directly through the map's key-value pairs to construct the custom `displayText`.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Type system

# [Type system](https://www.tradingview.com#type-system)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

The Pine Script™ type system determines the compatibility of a script's
values with various functions and operations. While it's possible to
write simple scripts without knowing anything about the type system, a
reasonable understanding of it is necessary to achieve any degree of
proficiency with the language, and an in-depth knowledge of its
subtleties allows programmers to harness its full potential.

Pine Script™ uses [types](#types) to classify all values, and it uses [qualifiers](#qualifiers) to determine whether values and references are constant, established on the first script execution, or dynamic across executions. This system applies to all Pine values and references, including literals, variables, expressions, function returns, and function arguments.

The type system closely intertwines with Pine's
[execution model](#execution-model) and
[time series](#time-series) concepts.
Understanding all three is essential for making the most of the power of
Pine Script™.

## [Qualifiers](https://www.tradingview.com#qualifiers)

Pine Script™ *qualifiers* identify when values are accessible to a
script:

- Values and references qualified as
  [const](#const) are established at compile time (i.e., when saving the
  script in the Pine Editor or adding it to the chart).
- Values qualified as
  [input](#input) are established at input time (i.e., when confirming values
  based on user input, primarily from the "Settings/Inputs" tab).
- Values qualified as
  [simple](#simple) are established at bar zero (i.e., the first
  script execution).
- Values qualified as
  [series](#series) can change throughout the script's executions.

Pine Script™ bases the dominance of type qualifiers on the following
hierarchy: **const < input < simple < series**, where "const" is
the *weakest* qualifier and "series" is the *strongest*. The qualifier
hierarchy translates to this rule: whenever a variable, function, or
operation is compatible with a specific qualified type, values with
*weaker* qualifiers are also allowed.

Scripts always qualify their expressions' returned types based on the
*dominant qualifier* in their calculations. For example, evaluating an
expression that involves "input" and "series" values will return a
value qualified as "series". Furthermore, scripts **cannot** change a
value's qualifier to one that's *lower* on the hierarchy. If a value
acquires a *stronger* qualifier (e.g., a value initially inferred as
"simple" becomes "series" later in the script's executions), that
state is irreversible.

It's important to note that "series" values are the **only** ones
that can change across script executions, including those from various
built-ins, such as
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
and
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume),
as well as the results of expressions involving "series" values. All
values qualified as "const", "input", or "simple" remain
consistent across all script executions.

### [const](https://www.tradingview.com#const)

Values or references qualified as "const" are established at *compile
time*, before the script starts its executions. Compilation initially
occurs when saving a script in the Pine Editor, which does not require
it to run on a chart. Values or references with the "const" qualifier
*never change* between script executions, not even on the first
execution.

All *literal* values and the results returned by expressions involving
only values qualified as "const" automatically adopt the "const"
qualifier.

These are some examples of literal values:

- *literal int*: `1`, `-1`, `42`
- *literal float*: `1.`, `1.0`, `3.14`, `6.02E-23`, `3e8`
- *literal bool*: `true`, `false`
- *literal color*: `#FF55C6`, `#FF55C6ff`
- *literal string*: `"A text literal"`,
  `"Embedded single quotes 'text'"`, `'Embedded double quotes "text"'`

Our [Style guide](#style-guide)
recommends using uppercase SNAKE_CASE to name "const" variables for
readability. While not a requirement, one can also use the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword when declaring "const" variables so the script only
initializes them on the *first bar* of the dataset. See
[this section](#var) of our User Manual for more information.

Below is an example that uses "const" values within the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
and
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
functions, which both require a value of the "const string" qualified
type as their `title` argument:

```
//@version=6

// The following global variables are all of the "const string" qualified type:

//@variable The title of the indicator.
INDICATOR_TITLE = "const demo"
//@variable The title of the first plot.
var PLOT1_TITLE = "High"
//@variable The title of the second plot.
const string PLOT2_TITLE = "Low"
//@variable The title of the third plot.
PLOT3_TITLE = "Midpoint between " + PLOT1_TITLE + " and " + PLOT2_TITLE

indicator(INDICATOR_TITLE, overlay = true)

plot(high, PLOT1_TITLE)
plot(low, PLOT2_TITLE)
plot(hl2, PLOT3_TITLE)
```

The following example will raise a compilation error since it uses
[syminfo.ticker](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.ticker),
which returns a "simple" value because it depends on chart information
that's only accessible after the script's first execution:

```
//@version=6

//@variable The title in the `indicator()` call.
var NAME = "My indicator for " + syminfo.ticker

indicator(NAME, "", true) // Causes an error because `NAME` is qualified as a "simple string".
plot(close)
```

The
[const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const)
keyword allows the declaration of variables and parameters with constant
*value assignments*. Declaring a variable with this keyword instructs
the script to forbid using *reassignment* and *compound assignment*
operations on it. For example, this script declares the `myVar` variable
with the keyword, then attempts to assign a new "float" value to the
variable with the addition assignment operator
([+=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_+=)),
resulting in a compilation error:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Cannot reassign const demo")

//@variable A "float" variable declared as `const`, preventing reassignment. 
const float myVar = 0.0

myVar += 1.0 // Causes an error. Reassignment and compound assignments are not allowed on `const` variables.

plot(myVar)
```

It's crucial to note that declaring a variable with the
[const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const)
keyword forces it to maintain a constant reference to the value returned
by a specific expression, but that *does not* necessarily define the
nature of the assigned value. For example, a script can declare a
[const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const)
variable that maintains a constant reference to an expression returning
the *ID* of a *special type*. Although the script cannot *reassign* the
variable, the assigned ID is a "series" value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Constant reference to 'series' ID demo")

//@variable A `label` variable declared as `const`, preventing reassignment.
//          Although the reference is constant, the ID of the `label` is a "series" value.
const label myVar = label.new(bar_index, close)
```

### [input](https://www.tradingview.com#input)

Most values qualified as "input" are established after initialization
via the `input.*()` functions. These functions produce values that users
can modify within the "Inputs" tab of the script's settings. When one
changes any of the values in this tab, the script *restarts* from the
beginning of the chart's history to ensure its inputs are consistent
throughout its executions. Some of Pine's built-in variables, such as
[chart.bg_color](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.bg_color)
also use the "input" qualifier, even though `input.*()` functions do
not return them, since the script receives their values at *input time*.

The following script plots the value of a `sourceInput` from the `symbolInput` and `timeframeInput` context. The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call is valid in this script since its `symbol` and `timeframe` parameters allow "series string" arguments by default, meaning they can also accept "input string" values because the "input" qualifier is *lower* on the hierarchy:

```
//@version=6
indicator("input demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The symbol to request data from. Qualified as "input string".
symbolInput = input.symbol("AAPL", "Symbol")
//@variable The timeframe of the data request. Qualified as "input string".
timeframeInput = input.timeframe("D", "Timeframe")
//@variable The source of the calculation. Qualified as "series float".
sourceInput = input.source(close, "Source")

//@variable The `sourceInput` value from the requested context. Qualified as "series float".
requestedSource = request.security(symbolInput, timeframeInput, sourceInput)

plot(requestedSource)
```

### [simple](https://www.tradingview.com#simple)

Values qualified as "simple" are available on the first script
execution, and they remain consistent across subsequent executions.

Users can explicitly define variables and parameters that accept
"simple" values by including the `simple` keyword in their
declaration.

Many built-in variables return "simple" qualified values because they
depend on information that a script can only obtain once it starts
running on the chart. Additionally, many built-in functions require
"simple" arguments that do not change over time. Wherever a script
allows "simple" values, it can also accept values qualified as
"input" or "const".

This script highlights the background to warn users that they're using
a non-standard chart type. It uses the value of
[chart.is_standard](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.is_standard)
to calculate the `isNonStandard` variable, then uses that variable's
value to calculate a `warningColor` that also references a "simple"
value. The `color` parameter of
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
allows a "series color" argument, meaning it can also accept a
"simple color" value since "simple" is lower on the hierarchy:

```
//@version=6
indicator("simple demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` when the current chart is non-standard. Qualified as "simple bool".
isNonStandard = not chart.is_standard
//@variable Is orange when the the current chart is non-standard. Qualified as "simple color".
simple color warningColor = isNonStandard ? color.new(color.orange, 70) : na

// Colors the chart's background to warn that it's a non-standard chart type.
bgcolor(warningColor, title = "Non-standard chart color")
```

### [series](https://www.tradingview.com#series)

Values qualified as "series" provide the most flexibility in scripts
since they can change across executions.

Users can explicitly define variables and parameters that accept
"series" values by including the `series` keyword in their
declarations.

Built-in variables such as
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low),
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume),
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time),
and
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index),
and the result from any expression using such built-ins, are qualified
as "series". The result of any function or operation that returns a
dynamic value will always be a "series", as will the results from
using the history-referencing operator
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
to access historical values. Wherever a script allows "series" values,
it will also accept values with any other qualifier, as "series" is
the *highest* qualifier on the hierarchy.

This script displays the
[highest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
and
[lowest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.lowest)
value of a `sourceInput` over `lengthInput` bars. The values assigned to
the `highest` and `lowest` variables are of the "series float"
qualified type, as they can change throughout the script's execution:

```
//@version=6
indicator("series demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The source value to calculate on. Qualified as "series float".
series float sourceInput = input.source(close, "Source")
//@variable The number of bars in the calculation. Qualified as "input int".
lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length")

//@variable The highest `sourceInput` value over `lengthInput` bars. Qualified as "series float".
series float highest = ta.highest(sourceInput, lengthInput)
//@variable The lowest `sourceInput` value over `lengthInput` bars. Qualified as "series float".
lowest = ta.lowest(sourceInput, lengthInput)

plot(highest, "Highest source", color.green)
plot(lowest, "Lowest source", color.red)
```

## [Types](https://www.tradingview.com#types)

Pine Script™ *types* classify values and determine the functions and
operations they're compatible with. They include:

- The fundamental types:
  [int](#int),
  [float](#float),
  [bool](#bool),
  [color](#color),
  and [string](#string)
- The special types:
  [plot](#plot-and-hline),
  [hline](#plot-and-hline),
  [line](#drawing-types),
  [linefill](#drawing-types),
  [box](#drawing-types),
  [polyline](#drawing-types),
  [label](#drawing-types),
  [table](#drawing-types),
  [chart.point](#chart-points),
  [array](#collections),
  [matrix](#collections), and
  [map](#collections)
- [User-defined types (UDTs)](#user-defined-types)
- [Enums](#enum-types)
- [void](#void)

Fundamental types refer to the underlying nature of a value, e.g., a
value of 1 is of the "int" type, 1.0 is of the "float" type,
"AAPL" is of the "string" type, etc. Special types and user-defined
types utilize *IDs* that refer to objects of a specific type. For
example, a value of the "label" type contains an ID that acts as a
*pointer* referring to a "label" object. The "void" type refers to
the output from a function or [method](#methods) that does not return a usable value.

Pine Script™ can automatically convert values from some types into
others. The auto-casting rules are: **int → float → bool**. See the
[Type casting](#type-casting) section of this page for more information.

In most cases, Pine Script™ can automatically determine a value's type.
However, we can also use type keywords to *explicitly* specify types for
readability and for code that requires explicit definitions (e.g.,
declaring a variable assigned to
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)). For
example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Types demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A value of the "const string" type for the `ma` plot's title.
string MA_TITLE = "MA"

//@variable A value of the "input int" type. Controls the length of the average.
int lengthInput = input.int(100, "Length", minval = 2)

//@variable A "series float" value representing the last `close` that crossed over the `ma`.
var float crossValue = na

//@variable A "series float" value representing the moving average of `close`.
float ma = ta.sma(close, lengthInput)
//@variable A "series bool" value that's `true` when the `close` crosses over the `ma`.
bool crossUp = ta.crossover(close, ma)
//@variable A "series color" value based on whether `close` is above or below its `ma`.
color maColor = close > ma ? color.lime : color.fuchsia

// Update the `crossValue`.
if crossUp
    crossValue := close

plot(ma, MA_TITLE, maColor)
plot(crossValue, "Cross value", style = plot.style_circles)
plotchar(crossUp, "Cross Up", "▲", location.belowbar, size = size.small)
```

### [int](https://www.tradingview.com#int)

Values of the "int" type represent integers, i.e., whole numbers
without any fractional quantities.

Integer literals are numeric values written in *decimal* notation. For
example:

```
1
-1
750
```

Built-in variables such as
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index),
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time),
[timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow),
[dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth),
and
[strategy.wintrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.wintrades)
all return values of the "int" type.

### [float](https://www.tradingview.com#float)

Values of the "float" type represent floating-point numbers, i.e.,
numbers that can contain whole and fractional quantities.

Floating-point literals are numeric values written with a `.` delimiter.
They may also contain the symbol `e` or `E` (which means "10 raised to
the power of X", where X is the number after the `e` or `E` symbol).
For example:

```
3.14159    // Rounded value of Pi (π)
- 3.0
6.02e23    // 6.02 * 10^23 (a very large value)
1.6e-19    // 1.6 * 10^-19 (a very small value)
```

The internal precision of "float" values in Pine Script™ is 1e-16.

Built-in variables such as
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
[hlcc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlcc4),
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume),
[ta.vwap](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ta.vwap),
and
[strategy.position_size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_size)
all return values of the "float" type.

### [bool](https://www.tradingview.com#bool)

Values of the "bool" type represent the truth value of a comparison or
condition, which scripts can use in
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures) and other expressions.

There are only two literals that represent boolean values:

```
true    // true value
false   // false value
```

A `bool` variable can never be [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), and any [conditional
structure](#conditional-structures) that can return `na` will return `false` instead. For example, an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) condition returns `bool` values, when the condition is not met and the `else` block is not specified, it will returns `false`.

Built-in variables such as
[barstate.isfirst](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isfirst),
[chart.is_heikinashi](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.is_heikinashi),
[session.ismarket](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_session.ismarket),
and
[timeframe.isdaily](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.isdaily)
all return values of the "bool" type.

### [color](https://www.tradingview.com#color)

Color literals have the following format: `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`. The
letter pairs represent *hexadecimal* values between `00` and `FF` (0 to
255 in decimal) where:

- `RR`, `GG` and `BB` pairs respectively represent the values for the
  color's red, green and blue components.
- `AA` is an optional value for the color's opacity (or *alpha*
  component) where `00` is invisible and `FF` opaque. When the literal
  does not include an `AA` pair, the script treats it as fully opaque
  (the same as using `FF`).
- The hexadecimal letters in the literals can be uppercase or
  lowercase.

These are examples of "color" literals:

```
#000000      // black color
#FF0000      // red color
#00FF00      // green color
#0000FF      // blue color
#FFFFFF      // white color
#808080      // gray color
#3ff7a0      // some custom color
#FF000080    // 50% transparent red color
#FF0000ff    // same as #FF0000, fully opaque red color
#FF000000    // completely transparent red color
```

Pine Script™ also has
[built-in color constants](#constant-colors), including
[color.green](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color%7Bdot%7Dgreen),
[color.red](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color%7Bdot%7Dred),
[color.orange](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color%7Bdot%7Dorange),
[color.blue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color%7Bdot%7Dblue)
(the default color in `plot*()` functions and many of the default
color-related properties in
[drawing types](#drawing-types)), etc.

When using built-in color constants, it is possible to add transparency
information to them via the
[color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new)
function.

Note that when specifying red, green or blue components in `color.*()`
functions, we use "int" or "float" arguments with values between 0
and 255. When specifying transparency, we use a value between 0 and 100,
where 0 means fully opaque and 100 means completely transparent. For
example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Shading the chart's background", overlay = true)

//@variable A "const color" value representing the base for each day's color. 
color BASE_COLOR = color.rgb(0, 99, 165)

//@variable A "series int" value that modifies the transparency of the `BASE_COLOR` in `color.new()`.
int transparency = 50 + int(40 * dayofweek / 7)

// Color the background using the modified `BASE_COLOR`.
bgcolor(color.new(BASE_COLOR, transparency))
```

See the User Manual's page on [colors](#colors) for more information on using colors in scripts.

### [string](https://www.tradingview.com#string)

Values of the "string" type represent sequences of letters, numbers,
symbols, spaces, and other characters.

String literals in Pine are characters enclosed in single or double
quotation marks. For example:

```
"This is a string literal using double quotes."
'This is a string literal using single quotes.'
```

Single and double quotation marks are functionally equivalent in Pine
Script™. A "string" enclosed within double quotation marks can contain
any number of single quotation marks and vice versa:

```
"It's an example"
'The "Star" indicator'
```

Scripts can *escape* the enclosing delimiter in a "string" using the
backslash character (`\`). For example:

```
'It\'s an example'
"The \"Star\" indicator"
```

We can create "string" values containing the new line escape character
(`\n`) for displaying multi-line text with `plot*()` and `log.*()`
functions and objects of
[drawing types](#drawing-types). For example:

```
"This\nString\nHas\nOne\nWord\nPer\nLine"
```

We can use the
[+](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_+) operator
to concatenate "string" values:

```
"This is a " + "concatenated string."
```

The built-ins in the `str.*()` namespace create "string" values using
specialized operations. For instance, this script creates a *formatted
string* to represent "float" price values and displays the result
using a label:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Formatted string demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A "series string" value representing the bar's OHLC data.
string ohlcString = str.format("Open: {0}\nHigh: {1}\nLow: {2}\nClose: {3}", open, high, low, close)

// Draw a label containing the `ohlcString`.
label.new(bar_index, high, ohlcString, textcolor = color.white)
```

See our User Manual's page on
[Text and shapes](#text-and-shapes) for
more information about displaying "string" values from a script.

Built-in variables such as
[syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid),
[syminfo.currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.currency),
and
[timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period)
return values of the "string" type.

### [plot and hline](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-and-hline)

Pine Script™'s
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
and
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
functions return IDs that respectively reference instances of the
"plot" and "hline" types. These types display calculated values and
horizontal levels on the chart, and one can assign their IDs to
variables for use with the built-in
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function.

For example, this script plots two EMAs on the chart and fills the space
between them using a
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
call:

```
//@version=6
indicator("plot fill demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A "series float" value representing a 10-bar EMA of `close`.
float emaFast = ta.ema(close, 10)
//@variable A "series float" value representing a 20-bar EMA of `close`.
float emaSlow = ta.ema(close, 20)

//@variable The plot of the `emaFast` value.
emaFastPlot = plot(emaFast, "Fast EMA", color.orange, 3)
//@variable The plot of the `emaSlow` value.
emaSlowPlot = plot(emaSlow, "Slow EMA", color.gray, 3)

// Fill the space between the `emaFastPlot` and `emaSlowPlot`.
fill(emaFastPlot, emaSlowPlot, color.new(color.purple, 50), "EMA Fill")
```

It's important to note that unlike other special types, there is no
`plot` or `hline` keyword in Pine to explicitly declare a variable's
type as "plot" or "hline".

Users can control where their scripts' plots display via the variables
in the `display.*` namespace and a `plot*()` function's `force_overlay`
parameter. Additionally, one script can use the values from another
script's plots as *external inputs* via the
[input.source()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.source)
function (see our User Manual's section on
[source inputs](#source-input)).

### [Drawing types](https://www.tradingview.com#drawing-types)

Pine Script™ drawing types allow scripts to create custom drawings on
charts. They include the following:
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
and
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table).

Each type also has a namespace containing all the built-ins that create
and manage drawing instances. For example, the following `*.new()`
constructors create new objects of these types in a script:
[line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new),
[linefill.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.new),
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new),
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new),
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new),
and
[table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.new).

Each of these functions returns an *ID* which is a reference that
uniquely identifies a drawing object. IDs are always qualified as
"series", meaning their qualified types are "series line", "series
label", etc. Drawing IDs act like pointers, as each ID references a
specific instance of a drawing in all the functions from that drawing's
namespace. For instance, the ID of a line returned by a
[line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
call is used later to refer to that specific object once it's time to
delete it with
[line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete).

### [Chart points](https://www.tradingview.com#chart-points)

Chart points are special types that represent coordinates on the chart.
Scripts use the information from
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
objects to determine the chart locations of
[lines](#lines),
[boxes](#boxes),
[polylines](#polylines),
and [labels](#labels).

Objects of this type contain three *fields*: `time`, `index`, and
`price`. Whether a drawing instance uses the `time` or `price` field
from a
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
as an x-coordinate depends on the drawing's `xloc` property.

We can use any of the following functions to create chart points in a
script:

- [chart.point.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.new) -
  Creates a new
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  with a specified `time`, `index`, and `price`.
- [chart.point.now()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.now) -
  Creates a new
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  with a specified `price` y-coordinate. The `time` and `index` fields
  contain the
  [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
  and
  [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
  of the bar the function executes on.
- [chart.point_from_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.from_index) -
  Creates a new
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  with an `index` x-coordinate and `price` y-coordinate. The `time`
  field of the resulting instance is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
  meaning it will not work with drawing objects that use an `xloc`
  value of
  [xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time).
- [chart.point.from_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.from_time) -
  Creates a new
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  with a `time` x-coordinate and `price` y-coordinate. The `index`
  field of the resulting instance is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
  meaning it will not work with drawing objects that use an `xloc`
  value of
  [xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index).
- [chart.point.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.copy) -
  Creates a new
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  containing the same `time`, `index`, and `price` information as the
  `id` in the function call.

This example draws lines connecting the previous bar's
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
to the current bar's
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) on
each chart bar. It also displays labels at both points of each line. The
line and labels get their information from the `firstPoint` and
`secondPoint` variables, which reference chart points created using
[chart.point_from_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.from_index)
and
[chart.point.now()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.now):

```
//@version=6
indicator("Chart points demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A new `chart.point` at the previous `bar_index` and `high`.
firstPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index - 1, high[1])
//@variable A new `chart.point` at the current bar's `low`.
secondPoint = chart.point.now(low)

// Draw a new line connecting coordinates from the `firstPoint` and `secondPoint`.
// This line uses the `index` fields from the points as x-coordinates.
line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, color = color.purple, width = 3)
// Draw a label at the `firstPoint`. Uses the point's `index` field as its x-coordinate.
label.new(
     firstPoint, str.tostring(firstPoint.price), color = color.green, 
     style = label.style_label_down, textcolor = color.white
 )
// Draw a label at the `secondPoint`. Uses the point's `index` field as its x-coordinate.
label.new(
     secondPoint, str.tostring(secondPoint.price), color = color.red, 
     style = label.style_label_up, textcolor = color.white
 )
```

### [Collections](https://www.tradingview.com#collections)

Collections in Pine Script™ ([arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices),
and [maps](#maps)) utilize reference
IDs, much like other special types (e.g., labels). The type of the ID
defines the type of *elements* the collection will contain. In Pine, we
specify array, matrix, and map types by appending a
[type template](#type-templates) to the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix),
or [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
keywords:

- `array<int>` defines an array containing "int" elements.
- `array<label>` defines an array containing "label" IDs.
- `array<UDT>` defines an array containing IDs referencing objects of
  a
  [user-defined type (UDT)](#user-defined-types).
- `matrix<float>` defines a matrix containing "float" elements.
- `matrix<UDT>` defines a matrix containing IDs referencing objects of
  a
  [user-defined type (UDT)](#user-defined-types).
- `map<string, float>` defines a map containing "string" keys and
  "float" values.
- `map<int, UDT>` defines a map containing "int" keys and IDs of
  [user-defined type (UDT)](#user-defined-types) instances as values.

For example, one can declare an "int" array with a single element
value of 10 in any of the following, equivalent ways:

```
a1 = array.new<int>(1, 10)
array<int> a2 = array.new<int>(1, 10)
a3 = array.from(10)
array<int> a4 = array.from(10)
```

Note that:

- The `int[]` syntax can also specify an array of "int"
  elements, but its use is discouraged. No equivalent exists to
  specify the types of matrices or maps in that way.
- Type-specific built-ins exist for arrays, such as
  [array.new_int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dnew_int),
  but the more generic [array.new<type>](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
  form is preferred, which would be `array.new<int>()` to create
  an array of "int" elements.

### [User-defined types](https://www.tradingview.com#user-defined-types)

The
[type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_type)
keyword allows the creation of *user-defined types* (UDTs) from which
scripts can create [objects](#objects). UDTs are composite types; they contain an arbitrary number
of *fields* that can be of any type, including other user-defined types.

The syntax to declare a user-defined type is:

```
[export ]type <UDT_identifier>    <field_type> <field_name>[ = <value>]    ...
```

where:

- [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export)
  is the keyword that a
  [library](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)
  script uses to export the user-defined type. To learn more about
  exporting UDTs, see our User Manual's
  [Libraries](#user-defined-types-and-objects)
  page.
- `<UDT_identifier>` is the name of the user-defined type.
- `<field_type>` is the type of the field.
- `<field_name>` is the name of the field.
- `<value>` is an optional default value for the field, which the
  script will assign to it when creating new objects of that UDT. If
  one does not provide a value, the field's default is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).
  The same rules as those governing the default values of parameters
  in function signatures apply to the default values of fields. For
  example, a UDT's default values cannot use results from the
  history-referencing operator
  [[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
  or expressions.

This example declares a `pivotPoint` UDT with an "int" `pivotTime`
field and a "float" `priceLevel` field that will respectively hold
time and price information about a calculated pivot:

```
//@type             A user-defined type containing pivot information.
    //@field pivotTime  Contains time information about the pivot.
    //@field priceLevel Contains price information about the pivot.
    type pivotPoint
        int   pivotTime
        float priceLevel
```

User-defined types support *type recursion*, i.e., the fields of a UDT
can reference objects of the same UDT. Here, we've added a `nextPivot`
field to our previous `pivotPoint` type that references another
`pivotPoint` instance:

```
//@type             A user-defined type containing pivot information.
    //@field pivotTime  Contains time information about the pivot.
    //@field priceLevel Contains price information about the pivot.
    //@field nextPivot  A `pivotPoint` instance containing additional pivot information.
    type pivotPoint
        int        pivotTime
        float      priceLevel
        pivotPoint nextPivot
```

Scripts can use two built-in methods to create and copy UDTs: `new()`
and `copy()`. See our User Manual's page on
[Objects](#objects) to learn more
about working with UDTs.

### [Enum types](https://www.tradingview.com#enum-types)

The [enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_enum) keyword allows the creation of an *enum*, otherwise known as an *enumeration*, *enumerated type*, or *enum type*. An enum is a unique type construct containing distinct, named fields representing *members* (i.e., possible values) of the type. Enums allow programmers to control the values accepted by variables, conditional expressions, and [collections](#collections), and they facilitate convenient dropdown [input](#enum-input) creation with the [input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum) function.

The syntax to declare an enum is as follows:

```
[export ]enum <enumName>    <field_1>[ = <title_1>]    <field_2>[ = <title_2>]    ...    <field_N>[ = <title_N>]
```

where:

- [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export)
  is the optional keyword allowing a
  [library](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)
  to export the enum for use in other scripts. See
  [this section](#enum-types) to learn more about exporting enum types.
- `<enumName>` is the name of the enum type. Scripts can use the
  enum's name as the type keyword in
  [variable declarations](#variable-declarations) and
  [type templates](#type-templates).
- `<field_*>` is the name of an enum field, representing a named
  member (value) of the `enumName` type. Each field must have a unique
  name that does not match the name or title of any other field in the
  enum. To retrieve an enum member, reference its field name using dot
  notation syntax (i.e., `enumName.fieldName`).
- `<title_*>` is a "const string" title assigned to a field. If one
  does not specify a title, the field's title is the "string"
  representation of its name. The
  [input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
  function displays field titles within its dropdown in the script's
  "Settings/Inputs" tab. Users can also retrieve a field's title
  with the
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
  function. As with field names, each field's title must not match
  the name or title of any other field in the enum.

This example declares an `maChoice` enum. Each field within this
declaration represents a distinct member of the `maChoice` enum type:

```
//@enum       An enumeration of named values for moving average selection.
//@field sma  Selects a Simple Moving Average.
//@field ema  Selects an Exponential Moving Average.
//@field wma  Selects a Weighted Moving Average.
//@field hma  Selects a Hull Moving Average.
enum maChoice
    sma  = "Simple Moving Average"
    ema  = "Exponential Moving Average"
    wma  = "Weighted Moving Average"
    hma  = "Hull Moving Average"
```

Note that:

- All the enum's possible values are available upon the *first*
  script execution and do not change across subsequent executions.
  Hence, they automatically adopt the
  [simple](#simple) qualifier.

The script below uses the `maChoice` enum within an
[input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
call to create a *dropdown* input in the "Settings/Inputs" tab that
displays all the field titles. The `maInput` value represents the member
of the enum that corresponds to the user-selected title. The script uses
the selected member within a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure to determine the built-in moving average it calculates:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Enum types demo", overlay = true)

//@enum       An enumeration of named values for moving average selection.
//@field sma  Selects a Simple Moving Average.
//@field ema  Selects an Exponential Moving Average.
//@field wma  Selects a Weighted Moving Average.
//@field hma  Selects a Hull Moving Average.
enum maChoice
    sma  = "Simple Moving Average"
    ema  = "Exponential Moving Average"
    wma  = "Weighted Moving Average"
    hma  = "Hull Moving Average"

//@variable The `maChoice` member representing a selected moving average name.
maChoice maInput = input.enum(maChoice.sma, "Moving average type")
//@variable The length of the moving average.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1, 4999)

//@variable The moving average selected by the `maInput`. 
float selectedMA = switch maInput
    maChoice.sma => ta.sma(close, lengthInput)
    maChoice.ema => ta.ema(close, lengthInput)
    maChoice.wma => ta.wma(close, lengthInput)
    maChoice.hma => ta.hma(close, lengthInput)

// Plot the `selectedMA`.
plot(selectedMA, "Selected moving average", color.teal, 3)
```

See the [Enums](#enums) page and the
[Enum input](#enum-input) section of the [Inputs](#inputs) page to learn more about using enums and enum inputs.

### [void](https://www.tradingview.com#void)

There is a "void" type in Pine Script™. Functions having only
side-effects and returning no usable result return the "void" type. An
example of such a function is
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert);
it does something (triggers an alert event), but it returns no usable
value.

Scripts cannot use "void" results in expressions or assign them to
variables. No `void` keyword exists in Pine Script™ since one cannot
declare a variable of the "void" type.

## [`na` value](https://www.tradingview.com#na-value)

There is a special value in Pine Script™ called
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
which is an acronym for *not available*. We use
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) to
represent an undefined value from a variable or expression. It is
similar to `null` in Java and `None` in Python.

Scripts can automatically cast
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values to almost any type. However, in some cases, the compiler cannot
infer the type associated with an
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value
because more than one type-casting rule may apply. For example:

```
// Compilation error!
myVar = na
```

The above line of code causes a compilation error because the compiler
cannot determine the nature of the `myVar` variable, i.e., whether the
variable will reference numeric values for plotting, string values for
setting text in a label, or other values for some other purpose later in
the script's execution.

To resolve such errors, we must explicitly declare the type associated
with the variable. Suppose the `myVar` variable will reference "float"
values in subsequent script iterations. We can resolve the error by
declaring the variable with the
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
keyword:

```
float myVar = na
```

or by explicitly casting the
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value
to the "float" type via the
[float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_float)
function:

```
myVar = float(na)
```

To test if the value from a variable or expression is
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), we
call the
[na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na)
function, which returns `true` if the value is undefined. For example:

```
//@variable Is 0 if the `myVar` is `na`, `close` otherwise.
float myClose = na(myVar) ? 0 : close
```

Do not use the `==` comparison operator to test for
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values, as scripts cannot determine the equality of an undefined value:

```
//@variable Returns the `close` value. The script cannot compare the equality of `na` values, as they're undefined.
float myClose = myVar == na ? 0 : close
```

Best coding practices often involve handling
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values to prevent undefined values in calculations.

We can ensure the expression also returns an actionable value on the
first bar by replacing the undefined past value with a value from the
current bar. This line of code uses the
[nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz)
function to replace the past bar's
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
with the current bar's
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
when the value is
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na):

```
//@variable Is `true` when the `close` exceeds the last bar's `close` (or the current `open` if the value is `na`).
bool risingClose = close > nz(close[1], open)
```

Protecting scripts against
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
instances helps to prevent undefined values from propagating in a
calculation's results. For example, this script declares an
`allTimeHigh` variable on the first bar. It then uses the
[math.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.max)
between the `allTimeHigh` and the bar's
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
to update the `allTimeHigh` throughout its execution:

```
//@version=6
indicator("na protection demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The result of calculating the all-time high price with an initial value of `na`.
var float allTimeHigh = na

// Reassign the value of the `allTimeHigh`.
// Returns `na` on all bars because `math.max()` can't compare the `high` to an undefined value.
allTimeHigh := math.max(allTimeHigh, high)

plot(allTimeHigh) // Plots `na` on all bars.
```

This script plots a value of
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on
all bars, as we have not included any
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
protection in the code. To fix the behavior and plot the intended result
(i.e., the all-time high of the chart's prices), we can use
[nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) to
replace
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values in the `allTimeHigh` series:

```
//@version=6
indicator("na protection demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The result of calculating the all-time high price with an initial value of `na`.
var float allTimeHigh = na

// Reassign the value of the `allTimeHigh`.
// We've used `nz()` to prevent the initial `na` value from persisting throughout the calculation.
allTimeHigh := math.max(nz(allTimeHigh), high)

plot(allTimeHigh)
```

## [Type templates](https://www.tradingview.com#type-templates)

Type templates specify the data types that collections
([arrays](#arrays),
[matrices](#matrices), and
[maps](#maps)) can contain.

Templates for [arrays](#arrays) and
[matrices](#matrices) consist of a
single type identifier surrounded by angle brackets, e.g., `<int>`,
`<label>`, and `<PivotPoint>` (where `PivotPoint` is a
[user-defined type (UDT)](#user-defined-types)).

Templates for [maps](#maps) consist of
two type identifiers enclosed in angle brackets, where the first
specifies the type of *keys* in each key-value pair, and the second
specifies the *value* type. For example, `<string, float>` is a type
template for a map that holds `string` keys and `float` values.

Users can construct type templates from:

- Fundamental types:
  [int](#int),
  [float](#float),
  [bool](#bool),
  [color](#color),
  and [string](#string)
- The following special types:
  [line](#drawing-types),
  [linefill](#drawing-types),
  [box](#drawing-types),
  [polyline](#drawing-types),
  [label](#drawing-types),
  [table](#drawing-types), and
  [chart.point](#chart-points)
- [User-defined types (UDTs)](#user-defined-types)
- [Enum types](#enum-types)

Note that:

- [Maps](#maps) can use any of
  these types as *values*, but they can only accept fundamental
  types or [enum types](#enum-types) as *keys*.

Scripts use type templates to declare variables that reference
collections, and when creating new collection instances. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Type templates demo")

//@variable A variable initially assigned to `na` that accepts arrays of "int" values.
array<int> intArray = na
//@variable An empty matrix that holds "float" values.
floatMatrix = matrix.new<float>()
//@variable An empty map that holds "string" keys and "color" values.
stringColorMap = map.new<string, color>()
```

## [Type casting](https://www.tradingview.com#type-casting)

Pine Script™ includes an automatic type-casting mechanism that *casts*
(converts) **"int"** values to **"float"** when necessary. Variables
or expressions requiring "float" values can also use "int" values
because any integer can be represented as a floating point number with
its fractional part equal to 0.

It's sometimes necessary to cast one type to another when auto-casting
rules do not suffice. For such cases, the following type-casting
functions are available:
[int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int),
[float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_float),
[bool()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bool),
[color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color),
[string()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_string),
[line()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line),
[linefill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill),
[label()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label),
[box()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box),
and
[table()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table).

The example below shows a code that tries to use a "const float" value
as the `length` argument in the
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
function call. The script will fail to compile, as it cannot
automatically convert the "float" value to the required "int" type:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Explicit casting demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The length of the SMA calculation. Qualified as "const float".
float LENGTH = 10.0

float sma = ta.sma(close, LENGTH) // Compilation error. The `length` parameter requires an "int" value.

plot(sma)
```

The code raises the following error: *"Cannot call 'ta.sma' with
argument 'length'='LENGTH'. An argument of 'const float' type was
used but a 'series int' is expected."*

The compiler is telling us that the code is using a "float" value
where an "int" is required. There is no auto-casting rule to cast a
"float" to an "int", so we must do the job ourselves. In this
version of the code, we've used the
[int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int)
function to explicitly convert our "float" `LENGTH` value to the
"int" type within the
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
call:

```
//@version=6
indicator("explicit casting demo")

//@variable The length of the SMA calculation. Qualified as "const float".
float LENGTH = 10.0

float sma = ta.sma(close, int(LENGTH)) // Compiles successfully since we've converted the `LENGTH` to "int".

plot(sma)
```

Explicit type casting is also handy when declaring variables assigned to
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), as
explained in the
[previous section](#na-value).

For example, once could explicitly declare a variable with a value of
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) as a
"label" type in either of the following, equivalent ways:

```
// Explicitly specify that the variable references "label" objects:
label myLabel = na

// Explicitly cast the `na` value to the "label" type:
myLabel = label(na)
```

## [Tuples](https://www.tradingview.com#tuples)

A *tuple* is a comma-separated set of expressions enclosed in brackets.
When a function, [method](#methods),
or other local block returns more than one value, scripts return those
values in the form of a tuple.

For example, the following
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) returns the sum and product of two "float" values:

```
//@function Calculates the sum and product of two values.
calcSumAndProduct(float a, float b) =>
    //@variable The sum of `a` and `b`.
    float sum = a + b
    //@variable The product of `a` and `b`.
    float product = a * b
    // Return a tuple containing the `sum` and `product`.
    [sum, product]
```

When we call this function later in the script, we use a *tuple
declaration* to declare multiple variables corresponding to the values
returned by the function call:

```
// Declare a tuple containing the sum and product of the `high` and `low`, respectively.
[hlSum, hlProduct] = calcSumAndProduct(high, low)
```

Keep in mind that unlike declaring single variables, we cannot
explicitly define the types the tuple's variables (`hlSum` and
`hlProduct` in this case), will contain. The compiler automatically
infers the types associated with the variables in a tuple.

In the above example, the resulting tuple contains values of the same
type ("float"). However, it's important to note that tuples can
contain values of *multiple types*. For example, the `chartInfo()`
function below returns a tuple containing "int", "float", "bool",
"color", and "string" values:

```
//@function Returns information about the current chart.
chartInfo() =>
    //@variable The first visible bar's UNIX time value.
    int firstVisibleTime = chart.left_visible_bar_time
    //@variable The `close` value at the `firstVisibleTime`.
    float firstVisibleClose = ta.valuewhen(ta.cross(time, firstVisibleTime), close, 0)
    //@variable Is `true` when using a standard chart type, `false` otherwise.
    bool isStandard = chart.is_standard
    //@variable The foreground color of the chart.
    color fgColor = chart.fg_color
    //@variable The ticker ID of the current chart.
    string symbol = syminfo.tickerid
    // Return a tuple containing the values. 
    [firstVisibleTime, firstVisibleClose, isStandard, fgColor, symbol]
```

Tuples are especially handy for requesting multiple values in one
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call.

For instance, this `roundedOHLC()` function returns a tuple containing
OHLC values rounded to the nearest prices that are divisible by the
symbol's [minimum
tick](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.mintick)
value. We call this function as the `expression` argument in
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to request a tuple containing daily OHLC values:

```
//@function Returns a tuple of OHLC values, rounded to the nearest tick.
roundedOHLC() =>
    [math.round_to_mintick(open), math.round_to_mintick(high), math.round_to_mintick(low), math.round_to_mintick(close)]

[op, hi, lo, cl] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", roundedOHLC())
```

We can also achieve the same result by directly passing a tuple of
rounded values as the `expression` in the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call:

```
[op, hi, lo, cl] = request.security(
     syminfo.tickerid, "D", 
     [math.round_to_mintick(open), math.round_to_mintick(high), math.round_to_mintick(low), math.round_to_mintick(close)]
 )
```

Local blocks of
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures), including
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) and
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
statements, can return tuples. For example:

```
[v1, v2] = if close > open
    [high, close]
else
    [close, low]
```

and:

```
[v1, v2] = switch 
close > open => [high, close]
=>              [close, low]
```

However, ternaries cannot contain tuples, as the return values in a
ternary statement are not considered local blocks:

```
// Not allowed.
[v1, v2] = close > open ? [high, close] : [close, low]
```

Note that all items within a tuple returned from a function are
qualified as "simple" or "series", depending on its contents. If a
tuple contains a "series" value, all other elements within the tuple
will also adopt the "series" qualifier. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Qualified types in tuples demo")

getParameters(float source, simple int length) =>
    // The second item in the tuple becomes a "series" if `source` is a "series" 
    // because all returned tuple elements adopt the strongest qualifier. 
    [source, length]

// Although the `length` argument is a "const int", the `len` variable is a "series" because `src` is a "series".
[src, len] = getParameters(close, 20)

// Causes a compilation error because `ta.ema()` requires a "simple int" `length` argument. 
plot(ta.ema(src, len))
```

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Built-ins

# [Built-ins](https://www.tradingview.com#built-ins)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ has hundreds of *built-in* variables and functions. They
provide your scripts with valuable information and make calculations for
you, dispensing you from coding them. The better you know the built-ins,
the more you will be able to do with your Pine scripts.

On this page, we present an overview of some of Pine's built-in
variables and functions. They will be covered in more detail in the
pages of this manual covering specific themes.

All built-in variables and functions are defined in the Pine Script™ [v6
Reference
Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/). It is
called a "Reference Manual" because it is the definitive reference on
the Pine Script™ language. It is an essential tool that will accompany
you anytime you code in Pine, whether you are a beginner or an expert.
If you are learning your first programming language, make the [Reference
Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/) your
friend. Ignoring it will make your programming experience with Pine
Script™ difficult and frustrating — as it would with any other
programming language.

Variables and functions in the same family share the same *namespace*,
which is a prefix to the function's name. The
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dsma)
function, for example, is in the `ta` namespace, which stands for
"technical analysis". A namespace can contain both variables and
functions.

Some variables have function versions as well, e.g.:

- The
  [ta.tr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dtr)
  variable returns the "True Range" of the current bar. The
  [ta.tr(true)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dtr)
  function call also returns the "True Range", but when the previous
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  value which is normally needed to calculate it is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
  it calculates using `high - low` instead.
- The
  [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
  variable gives the time at the
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
  of the current bar. The
  [time(timeframe)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
  function returns the time of the bar's
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
  from the `timeframe` specified, even if the chart's timeframe is
  different. The [time(timeframe,
  session)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
  function returns the time of the bar's
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
  from the `timeframe` specified, but only if it is within the
  `session` time. The [time(timeframe, session,
  timezone)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
  function returns the time of the bar's
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
  from the `timeframe` specified, but only if it is within the
  `session` time in the specified `timezone`.

## [Built-in variables](https://www.tradingview.com#built-in-variables)

Built-in variables exist for different purposes. These are a few
examples:

- Price- and volume-related variables:

  etc.

Some functions do not return a result but are used for their side
effects, which means they do something, even if they don't return a
result:

- Functions used as a declaration statement defining one of three
  types of Pine scripts, and its properties. Each script must begin
  with a call to one of these functions:
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator),
  [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
  or
  [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library).
- Plotting or coloring functions:
  [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor),
  [plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar),
  [plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle),
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar),
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape),
  [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill).
- Strategy functions placing orders, in the `strategy` namespace:
  [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dcancel),
  [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclose),

  [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dorder),
  etc.
- Strategy functions returning information on indivdual past trades,
  in the `strategy` namespace:
  [strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dentry_bar_index),
  [strategy.closedtrades.entry_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dentry_price),

  [strategy.closedtrades.profit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dprofit),
  etc.
- Functions to generate alert events:
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  and
  [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition).

Other functions return a result, but we don't always use it, e.g.:
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline),
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot),
[array.pop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dpop),
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew),
etc.

All built-in functions are defined in the Pine Script™ [v6 Reference
Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/). You can
click on any of the function names listed here to go to its entry in the
Reference Manual, which documents the function's signature, i.e., the
list of *parameters* it accepts and the qualified type of the value(s)
it returns (a function can return more than one result). The Reference
Manual entry will also list, for each parameter:

- Its name.
- The qualified type of the value it requires (we use *argument* to
  name the values passed to a function when calling it).
- If the parameter is required or not.

All built-in functions have one or more parameters defined in their
signature. Not all parameters are required for every function.

Let's look at the
[ta.vwma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dvwma)
function, which returns the volume-weighted moving average of a source
value. This is its entry in the Reference Manual:

![image](images/BuiltIns-BuiltInFunctions.Csw66lto_Z11CbGU.png)

The entry gives us the information we need to use it:

- What the function does.
- Its signature (or definition):

```
ta.vwma(source, length) → series float
```

- The parameters it includes: `source` and `length`
- The qualified type of the result it returns: "series float".
- An example showing it in use: `plot(ta.vwma(close, 15))`.
- An example showing what it does, but in long form, so you can better
  understand its calculations. Note that this is meant to explain ---
  not as usable code, because it is more complicated and takes longer
  to execute. There are only disadvantages to using the long form.
- The "RETURNS" section explains exacty what value the function
  returns.
- The "ARGUMENTS" section lists each parameter and gives the
  critical information concerning what qualified type is required for
  arguments used when calling the function.
- The "SEE ALSO" section refers you to related Reference Manual
  entries.

This is a call to the function in a line of code that declares a
`myVwma` variable and assigns the result of `ta.vwma(close, 20)` to it:

```
myVwma = ta.vwma(close, 20)
```

Note that:

- We use the built-in variable
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  as the argument for the `source` parameter.
- We use `20` as the argument for the `length` parameter.
- If placed in the global scope (i.e., starting in a line's first
  position), it will be executed by the Pine Script™ runtime on each
  bar of the chart.

We can also use the parameter names when calling the function. Parameter
names are called *keyword arguments* when used in a function call:

```
myVwma = ta.vwma(source = close, length = 20)
```

You can change the position of arguments when using keyword arguments,
but only if you use them for all your arguments. When calling functions
with many parameters such as
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator),
you can also forego keyword arguments for the first arguments, as long
as you don't skip any. If you skip some, you must then use keyword
arguments so the Pine Script™ compiler can figure out which parameter
they correspond to, e.g.:

```
indicator("Example", "Ex", true, max_bars_back = 100)
```

Mixing things up this way is not allowed:

```
indicator(precision = 3, "Example") // Compilation error!
```

**When calling built-ins, it is critical to ensure that the arguments
you use are of the required qualified type, which will vary for each
parameter.**

To learn how to do this, one needs to understand Pine Script™'s
[type system](#type-system). The
Reference Manual entry for each built-in function includes an
"ARGUMENTS" section which lists the qualified type required for the
argument supplied to each of the function's parameters.

#### Type system](#type-system)[Next

#### User-defined functions](#user-defined-functions)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/User-defined functions

# [User-defined functions](https://www.tradingview.com#user-defined-functions)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

User-defined functions are functions that you write, as opposed to the
built-in functions in Pine Script™. They are useful to define
calculations that you must do repetitevely, or that you want to isolate
from your script's main section of calculations. Think of user-defined
functions as a way to extend the capabilities of Pine Script™, when no
built-in function will do what you need.

You can write your functions in two ways:

- In a single line, when they are simple, or
- On multiple lines

Functions can be located in two places:

- If a function is only used in one script, you can include it in the
  script where it is used. See our
  [Style guide](#function_declarations) for recommendations on where to place functions in your
  script.
- You can create a Pine Script™
  [library](#libraries) to include
  your functions, which makes them reusable in other scripts without
  having to copy their code. Distinct requirements exist for library
  functions. They are explained in the page on
  [libraries](#libraries).

Whether they use one line or multiple lines, user-defined functions have
the following characteristics:

- They cannot be embedded. All functions are defined in the script's
  global scope.
- They do not support recursion. It is **not allowed** for a function
  to call itself from within its own code.
- The type of the value returned by a function is determined
  automatically and depends on the type of arguments used in each
  particular function call.
- A function's returned value is that of the last value in the
  function's body.
- Each instance of a function call in a script maintains its own,
  independent history.

## [Single-line functions](https://www.tradingview.com#single-line-functions)

Simple functions can often be written in one line. This is the formal
definition of single-line functions:

```
<function_declaration>    <identifier>(<parameter_list>) => <return_value>
<parameter_list>    {<parameter_definition>{, <parameter_definition>}}
<parameter_definition>    [<identifier> = <default_value>]
<return_value>    <statement> | <expression> | <tuple>
```

Here is an example:

```
f(x, y) => x + y
```

After the function `f()` has been declared, it's possible to call it
using different types of arguments:

```
a = f(open, close)
b = f(2, 2)
c = f(open, 2)
```

In the example above, the type of variable `a` is *series* because the
arguments are both *series*. The type of variable `b` is *integer*
because arguments are both *literal integers*. The type of variable `c`
is *series* because the addition of a *series* and *literal integer*
produces a *series* result.

## [Multi-line functions](https://www.tradingview.com#multi-line-functions)

Pine Script™ also supports multi-line functions with the following
syntax:

```
<identifier>(<parameter_list>) =>    <local_block>
<identifier>(<list of parameters>) =>    <variable declaration>    ...    <variable declaration or expression>
```

where:

```
<parameter_list>    {<parameter_definition>{, <parameter_definition>}}
<parameter_definition>    [<identifier> = <default_value>]
```

The body of a multi-line function consists of several statements. Each
statement is placed on a separate line and must be preceded by 1
indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab). The indentation before the statement
indicates that it is a part of the body of the function and not part of
the script's global scope. After the function's code, the first
statement without an indent indicates the body of the function has
ended.

Either an expression or a declared variable should be the last statement
of the function's body. The result of this expression (or variable)
will be the result of the function's call. For example:

```
geom_average(x, y) =>
    a = x*x
    b = y*y
    math.sqrt(a + b)
```

The function `geom_average` has two arguments and creates two variables
in the body: `a` and `b`. The last statement calls the function
`math.sqrt` (an extraction of the square root). The `geom_average` call
will return the value of the last expression: `(math.sqrt(a + b))`.

## [Scopes in the script](https://www.tradingview.com#scopes-in-the-script)

Variables declared outside the body of a function or of other local
blocks belong to the *global* scope. User-declared and built-in
functions, as well as built-in variables also belong to the global
scope.

Each function has its own *local* scope. All the variables declared
within the function, as well as the function's arguments, belong to the
scope of that function, meaning that it is impossible to reference them
from outside --- e.g., from the global scope or the local scope of
another function.

On the other hand, since it is possible to refer to any variable or
function declared in the global scope from the scope of a function
(except for self-referencing recursive calls), one can say that the
local scope is embedded into the global scope.

In Pine Script™, nested functions are not allowed, i.e., one cannot
declare a function inside another one. All user functions are declared
in the global scope. Local scopes cannot intersect with each other.

## [Functions that return multiple results](https://www.tradingview.com#functions-that-return-multiple-results)

In most cases a function returns only one result, but it is possible to
return a list of results (a *tuple*-like result):

```
fun(x, y) =>
    a = x+y
    b = x-y
    [a, b]
```

Special syntax is required for calling such functions:

```
[res0, res1] = fun(open, close)
plot(res0)
plot(res1)
```

## [Limitations](https://www.tradingview.com#limitations)

User-defined functions can contain calls to most built-in functions within their local scopes. However, calls to any of the following functions are **not** allowed in a function's scope: [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor), [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor), [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape), [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar), [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow), [plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle), [plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar), [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline), [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill), [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition), [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), or [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library).

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Objects

ADVANCED

# [Objects](https://www.tradingview.com#objects)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ objects are instances of *user-defined types* (UDTs). They
are the equivalent of variables containing parts called *fields*, each
able to hold independent values that can be of various types.

Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as methodless classes. They
allow users to create custom types that organize different values under
one logical entity.

## [Creating objects](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-objects)

Before an object can be created, its type must be defined. The
[User-defined types](#user-defined-types) section of the
[Type system](#type-system) page
explains how to do so.

Let's define a `pivotPoint` type to hold pivot information:

```
type pivotPoint
    int x
    float y
    string xloc = xloc.bar_time
```

Note that:

- We use the
  [type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_type)
  keyword to declare the creation of a UDT.
- We name our new UDT `pivotPoint`.
- After the first line, we create a local block containing the type
  and name of each field.
- The `x` field will hold the x-coordinate of the pivot. It is
  declared as an "int" because it will hold either a timestamp or a
  bar index of "int" type.
- `y` is a "float" because it will hold the pivot's price.
- `xloc` is a field that will specify the units of `x`:
  [xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_index)
  or
  [xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_time).
  We set its default value to
  [xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_time)
  by using the `=` operator. When an object is created from that UDT,
  its `xloc` field will thus be set to that value.

Now that our `pivotPoint` UDT is defined, we can proceed to create
objects from it. We create objects using the UDT's `new()` built-in
method. To create a new `foundPoint` object from our `pivotPoint` UDT,
we use:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new()
```

We can also specify field values for the created object using the
following:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time, high)
```

Or the equivalent:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(x = time, y = high)
```

At this point, the `foundPoint` object's `x` field will contain the
value of the
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
built-in when it is created, `y` will contain the value of
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and the `xloc` field will contain its default value of
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_time)
because no value was defined for it when creating the object.

Object placeholders can also be created by declaring
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
object names using the following:

```
pivotPoint foundPoint = na
```

This example displays a label where high pivots are detected. The pivots
are detected `legsInput` bars after they occur, so we must plot the
label in the past for it to appear on the pivot:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Pivot labels", overlay = true)
int legsInput = input(10)

// Define the `pivotPoint` UDT.
type pivotPoint
    int x
    float y
    string xloc = xloc.bar_time

// Detect high pivots.
pivotHighPrice = ta.pivothigh(legsInput, legsInput)
if not na(pivotHighPrice)
    // A new high pivot was found; display a label where it occurred `legsInput` bars back.
    foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time[legsInput], pivotHighPrice)
    label.new(
      foundPoint.x,
      foundPoint.y,
      str.tostring(foundPoint.y, format.mintick),
      foundPoint.xloc,
      textcolor = color.white)
```

Take note of this line from the above example:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time[legsInput], pivotHighPrice)
```

This could also be written using the following:

```
pivotPoint foundPoint = na
foundPoint := pivotPoint.new(time[legsInput], pivotHighPrice)
```

When using the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword while declaring a variable assigned to an object of a
[user-defined type](#user-defined-types), the keyword automatically applies to all the object's
fields:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Objects using `var` demo")

//@type A custom type to hold index, price, and volume information.
type BarInfo
    int   index = bar_index
    float price = close
    float vol   = volume

//@variable A `BarInfo` instance whose fields persist through all iterations, starting from the first bar.
var BarInfo firstBar = BarInfo.new()
//@variable A `BarInfo` instance declared on every bar.
BarInfo currentBar = BarInfo.new()

// Plot the `index` fields of both instances to compare the difference. 
plot(firstBar.index)
plot(currentBar.index)
```

It's important to note that assigning an object to a variable that uses
the
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keyword does *not* automatically allow the object's fields to persist
without rolling back on each *intrabar* update. One must apply the
keyword to each desired field in the type declaration to achieve this
behavior. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Objects using `varip` fields demo")

//@type A custom type that counts the bars and ticks in the script's execution.
type Counter
    int       bars  = 0
    varip int ticks = 0

//@variable A `Counter` object whose reference persists throughout all bars.
var Counter counter = Counter.new()

// Add 1 to the `bars` and `ticks` fields. The `ticks` field is not subject to rollback on unconfirmed bars.
counter.bars  += 1
counter.ticks += 1

// Plot both fields for comparison. 
plot(counter.bars, "Bar counter", color.blue, 3)
plot(counter.ticks, "Tick counter", color.purple, 3)
```

Note that:

- We used the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword to specify that the `Counter` object assigned to the
  `counter` variable persists throughout the script's execution.
- The `bars` field rolls back on realtime bars, whereas the
  `ticks` field does not since we included
  [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
  in its declaration.

## [Changing field values](https://www.tradingview.com#changing-field-values)

The value of an object's fields can be changed using the
[:=](#-reassignment-operator)
reassignment operator.

This line of our previous example:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time[legsInput], pivotHighPrice)
```

Could be written using the following:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new()
foundPoint.x := time[legsInput]
foundPoint.y := pivotHighPrice
```

## [Collecting objects](https://www.tradingview.com#collecting-objects)

Pine Script™ collections ([arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices), and [maps](#maps)) can contain
objects, allowing users to add virtual dimensions to their data
structures. To declare a collection of objects, pass a UDT name into its
[type template](#type-templates).

This example declares an empty
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
that will hold objects of a `pivotPoint` user-defined type:

```
pivotHighArray = array.new<pivotPoint>()
```

To explicitly declare the type of a variable as an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix),
or [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
of a
[user-defined type](#user-defined-types), use the collection's type keyword followed by its
[type template](#type-templates). For example:

```
var array<pivotPoint> pivotHighArray = na
pivotHighArray := array.new<pivotPoint>()
```

Let's use what we have learned to create a script that detects high
pivot points. The script first collects historical pivot information in
an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).
It then loops through the array on the last historical bar, creating a
label for each pivot and connecting the pivots with lines:

![image](images/Objects-CollectingObjects-1.Or5ovJGC_Zw2Kvh.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Pivot Points High", overlay = true)

int legsInput = input(10)

// Define the `pivotPoint` UDT containing the time and price of pivots.
type pivotPoint
    int openTime
    float level

// Create an empty `pivotPoint` array.
var pivotHighArray = array.new<pivotPoint>()

// Detect new pivots (`na` is returned when no pivot is found).
pivotHighPrice = ta.pivothigh(legsInput, legsInput)

// Add a new `pivotPoint` object to the end of the array for each detected pivot.
if not na(pivotHighPrice)
    // A new pivot is found; create a new object of `pivotPoint` type, setting its `openTime` and `level` fields.
    newPivot = pivotPoint.new(time[legsInput], pivotHighPrice)
    // Add the new pivot object to the array.
    array.push(pivotHighArray, newPivot)

// On the last historical bar, draw pivot labels and connecting lines.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var pivotPoint previousPoint = na
    for eachPivot in pivotHighArray
        // Display a label at the pivot point.
        label.new(eachPivot.openTime, eachPivot.level, str.tostring(eachPivot.level, format.mintick), xloc.bar_time, textcolor = color.white)
        // Create a line between pivots.
        if not na(previousPoint)
            // Only create a line starting at the loop's second iteration because lines connect two pivots.
            line.new(previousPoint.openTime, previousPoint.level, eachPivot.openTime, eachPivot.level, xloc = xloc.bar_time)
        // Save the pivot for use in the next iteration.
        previousPoint := eachPivot
```

## [Copying objects](https://www.tradingview.com#copying-objects)

In Pine, objects are assigned by reference. When an existing object is
assigned to a new variable, both point to the same object.

In the example below, we create a `pivot1` object and set its `x` field
to 1000. Then, we declare a `pivot2` variable containing the reference
to the `pivot1` object, so both point to the same instance. Changing
`pivot2.x` will thus also change `pivot1.x`, as both refer to the `x`
field of the same object:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
type pivotPoint
    int x
    float y
pivot1 = pivotPoint.new()
pivot1.x := 1000
pivot2 = pivot1
pivot2.x := 2000
// Both plot the value 2000.
plot(pivot1.x)
plot(pivot2.x)
```

To create a copy of an object that is independent of the original, we
can use the built-in `copy()` method in this case.

In this example, we declare the `pivot2` variable referring to a copied
instance of the `pivot1` object. Now, changing `pivot2.x` will not
change `pivot1.x`, as it refers to the `x` field of a separate object:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
type pivotPoint
    int x
    float y
pivot1 = pivotPoint.new()
pivot1.x := 1000
pivot2 = pivotPoint.copy(pivot1)
pivot2.x := 2000
// Plots 1000 and 2000.
plot(pivot1.x)
plot(pivot2.x)
```

It's important to note that the built-in `copy()` method produces a
*shallow copy* of an object. If an object has fields with *special
types*
([array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix),
[map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map),
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table),
or
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)),
those fields in a shallow copy of the object will point to the same
instances as the original.

In the following example, we have defined an `InfoLabel` type with a
label as one of its fields. The script instantiates a `shallow` copy of
the `parent` object, then calls a user-defined `set()`[method](#methods) to update the
`info` and `lbl` fields of each object. Since the `lbl` field of both
objects points to the same label instance, changes to this field in
either object affect the other:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Shallow Copy")

type InfoLabel
    string info
    label  lbl

method set(InfoLabel this, int x = na, int y = na, string info = na) =>
    if not na(x)
        this.lbl.set_x(x)
    if not na(y)
        this.lbl.set_y(y)
    if not na(info)
        this.info := info
        this.lbl.set_text(this.info)

var parent  = InfoLabel.new("", label.new(0, 0))
var shallow = parent.copy()

parent.set(bar_index, 0, "Parent")
shallow.set(bar_index, 1, "Shallow Copy")
```

To produce a *deep copy* of an object with all of its special type
fields pointing to independent instances, we must explicitly copy those
fields as well.

In this example, we have defined a `deepCopy()` method that instantiates
a new `InfoLabel` object with its `lbl` field pointing to a copy of the
original's field. Changes to the `deep` copy's `lbl` field will not
affect the `parent` object, as it points to a separate instance:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Deep Copy")

type InfoLabel
    string info
    label  lbl

method set(InfoLabel this, int x = na, int y = na, string info = na) =>
    if not na(x)
        this.lbl.set_x(x)
    if not na(y)
        this.lbl.set_y(y)
    if not na(info)
        this.info := info
        this.lbl.set_text(this.info)

method deepCopy(InfoLabel this) =>
    InfoLabel.new(this.info, this.lbl.copy())

var parent = InfoLabel.new("", label.new(0, 0))
var deep   = parent.deepCopy()

parent.set(bar_index, 0, "Parent")
deep.set(bar_index, 1, "Deep Copy")
```

## [Shadowing](https://www.tradingview.com#shadowing)

To avoid potential conflicts in the eventuality where namespaces added
to Pine Script™ in the future would collide with UDTs or object names in
existing scripts; as a rule, UDTs and object names shadow the
language's namespaces. For example, a UDT or object can use the name of
built-in types, such as
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
or
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table).

Only the language's five primitive types cannot be used to name UDTs or
objects:
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int),
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float),
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string),
[bool](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_bool),
and
[color](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_color).

# [Enums](https://www.tradingview.com#enums)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ Enums, otherwise known as *enumerations*, *enumerated
types*, or
[enum types](#enum-types), are unique data types with all possible values (*members*)
explicitly defined by the programmer. They provide a human-readable,
expressive way to declare distinct sets of *predefined values* that
variables, conditional expressions, and
[collections](#collections) can accept, allowing more strict control over the values
used in a script's logic.

## [Declaring an enum](https://www.tradingview.com#declaring-an-enum)

To declare an enum, use the
[enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_enum)
keyword with the following syntax:

```
[export ]enum <enumName>    <field_1>[ = <title_1>]    <field_2>[ = <title_2>]    ...    <field_N>[ = <title_N>]
```

Each **field** in the enum represents a unique, *named member* (value)
of the [enum type](#enum-types). Users can specify optional "const string" **titles** for
enum fields to add extra information about what their values represent.
If the programmer does not specify a field's title, its title is the
"string" representation of its name.
[Enum inputs](#enum-input) display enum field titles within their dropdown menus in a
script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. Scripts can also retrieve enum field
titles using the
[str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
function, allowing their use in additional calculations. See
[this section](#utilizing-field-titles) below for more information.

While the above syntax may look similar to the syntax for declaring
[user-defined types (UDTs)](#user-defined-types), it's crucial to understand that
[enum types](#enum-types) and
[UDTs](#user-defined-types)
serve different purposes. Scripts use
[UDTs](#user-defined-types)
to create [objects](#objects) with
"series" fields that can hold values of *any* specified type. In
contrast, enums are distinct groups of "simple" fields representing
the specific, *predefined values* of the same *unique* type that
variables, expressions, and
[collections](#collections) can accept.

For example, this code block declares a `Signal` enum with three fields:
`buy`, `sell`, and `neutral`. Each field represents a distinct member
(possible value) of the `Signal`[enum type](#enum-types):

```
//@enum           An enumeration of named values representing buy, sell, and neutral signal states.
//@field buy      Represents a "Buy signal" state.
//@field sell     Represents a "Sell signal" state.
//@field neutral  Represents a "neutral" state. 
enum Signal
    buy     = "Buy signal"
    sell    = "Sell signal"
    neutral
```

Note that:

- The `Signal` identifier represents the enum's name, which
  signifies the *unique type* the fields belong to.
- We used the `//@enum` and `//@field`[annotations](#compiler-annotations) to document the meaning of the enum and its fields.
- Unlike the `buy` and `sell` fields, the `neutral` field does not
  include a specified title. As such, its title is the "string"
  representation of its *name* ("neutral").

To retrieve a member of an enum, reference its field name using *dot
notation* syntax, i.e.:

```
enumName.fieldName
```

As with other types, scripts can assign enum members to variables,
function parameters, and
[UDT](#user-defined-types)
fields, allowing strict control over their allowed values.

For instance, this line of code declares a `mySignal` variable whose
value is the `neutral` member of the `Signal` enum. Any value assigned
to this variable later must also be of the same
[enum type](#enum-types):

```
mySignal = Signal.neutral
```

Note that the above line does not require declaring the variable's
*type* as `Signal` because the compiler can automatically infer that
information from the assigned value. If we use
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) as
the initial value instead, we must use `Signal` as the type keyword to
specify that `mySignal` will accept a `Signal` member:

```
Signal mySignal = na
```

## [Using enums](https://www.tradingview.com#using-enums)

Scripts can compare enum members with the
[==](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_==) and
[!=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_!=)
operators and use them in
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures), allowing the convenient creation of logical patterns with a
reduced risk of unintended values or operations.

The following example declares an `OscType` enum with three fields
representing different oscillator choices: `rsi`, `mfi`, and `cci`. The
`calcOscillator()` function uses `OscType` members within a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure to determine which oscillator it calculates. The script calls
this function using the value from an
[enum input](#enum-input) as the `selection` argument and plots the
resulting oscillator:

![image](images/Enums-Using-enums-1.nGh65GZL_1UbRFt.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Using enums demo")

//@enum An enumeration of oscillator choices.
enum OscType
    rsi = "Relative Strength Index"
    mfi = "Money Flow Index"
    cci = "Commodity Channel Index"

//@variable An enumerator (member) of the `OscType` enum.
OscType oscInput = input.enum(OscType.rsi, "Oscillator type")

//@function         Calculates one of three oscillators based on a specified `selection`.
//@param source     The series of values to process.
//@param length     The number of bars in the calculation.
//@param selection  Determines which oscillator to calculate.
calcOscillator(float source, simple int length, OscType selection) =>
    result = switch selection
        OscType.rsi => ta.rsi(source, length)
        OscType.mfi => ta.mfi(source, length)
        OscType.cci => ta.cci(source, length)

// Plot the value of a `calcOscillator()` call with `oscInput` as the `selection`.
plot(calcOscillator(close, 20, oscInput))
```

Note that:

- The `selection` parameter of the `calcOscillator()` function can
  only take on one of *four* values: `OscType.rsi`, `OscType.mfi`,
  `OscType.cci`, or
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).
- The "Oscillator type" input in the script's
  "Settings/Inputs" tab displays all `OscType` field titles in
  its dropdown. See
  [this section](#enum-input) to learn more about enum inputs.

It's crucial to note that each declared enum represents a *unique*
type. Scripts **cannot** compare members of different enums or use such
members in expressions requiring a specific
[enum type](#enum-types), even if the fields have identical names and titles.

In this example, we added an `OscType2` enum to the above script and
changed the `oscInput` variable to use a member of that enum. The script
now raises a *compilation error* because it can't use a member of the
`OscType2` enum as the `selection` argument in the `calcOscillator()`
call:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Incompatible enums demo")

//@enum An enumeration of oscillator choices.
enum OscType
    rsi = "Relative Strength Index"
    mfi = "Money Flow Index"
    cci = "Commodity Channel Index"

//@enum An enumeration of oscillator choices. Its fields DO NOT represent the same values those in the `OscType` enum.
enum OscType2
    rsi = "Relative Strength Index"
    mfi = "Money Flow Index"
    cci = "Commodity Channel Index"

//@variable An enumerator (member) of the `OscType2` enum.
OscType2 oscInput = input.enum(OscType2.rsi, "Oscillator type")

//@function         Calculates one of three oscillators based on a specified `selection`.
//@param source     The series of values to process.
//@param length     The number of bars in the calculation.
//@param selection  Determines which oscillator to calculate.
calcOscillator(float source, simple int length, OscType selection) =>
    result = switch selection
        OscType.rsi => ta.rsi(source, length)
        OscType.mfi => ta.mfi(source, length)
        OscType.cci => ta.cci(source, length)

// Plot the value of a `calcOscillator()` call with `oscInput` as the `selection`.
// Raises a compilation error because only members of `OscType` are allowed. 
plot(calcOscillator(close, 20, oscInput))
```

### [Utilizing field titles](https://www.tradingview.com#utilizing-field-titles)

The "string" titles of an enum's fields allow programmers to add
extra information to each member. These field titles appear within a
dropdown in the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab when calling the
[input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
function.

Scripts can also utilize enum field titles in their calculations and
logic. Use the string conversion function
([str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring))
on an enum field to access its title.

The following example combines different enum field titles to construct
a ticker ID for requesting data from
[another context](#other-timeframes-and-data). The script declares two enums, `Exchange` and `Pair`, whose
respective fields represent *exchange* and *currency pair* names. It
uses
[input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
to assign user-specified enum members to the `exchangeInput` and
`pairInput` variables, then retrieves the "string" titles from those
variables with
[str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
and concatenates them to form an "Exchange:Symbol" pair for use in a
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call:

![image](images/Enums-Using-enums-Utilizing-field-titles-1.AzP84EB1_1aSLkU.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Utilizing field titles demo")

//@enum An enumeration of cryptocurrency exchanges. All field titles are the same as the field names.
enum Exchange
    BINANCE
    BITSTAMP
    BITFINEX
    COINBASE
    KRAKEN

//@enum An enumeration of cryptocurrency pairs. All the field titles are the same as the field names. 
enum Pair
    BTCUSD
    ETHUSD
    SOLUSD
    XRPUSD

//@variable An enumerator (member) of the `Exchange` enum.
Exchange exchangeInput = input.enum(Exchange.BINANCE, "Exchange")
//@variable An enumerator (member) of the `Pair` enum.
Pair pairInput = input.enum(Pair.BTCUSD, "Pair")

//@variable The exchange-symbol pair for the data request. 
simple string symbol = str.tostring(exchangeInput) + ":" + str.tostring(pairInput)

// Plot the `close` value requested from the `symbol` context.
plot(request.security(symbol, timeframe.period, close), "Requested close", color.purple, 3)
```

Note that:

- None of the members of the `Exchange` or `Pair` enums have
  specified titles. Therefore, each field's title is the
  "string" representation of its name, as shown by the script's
  [enum inputs](#enum-input).
- Calling the
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
  function on an enum field is the **only** way to retrieve its
  title for additional calculations. The
  [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
  and `log.*()` functions *cannot* accept enum members. To use a
  field's title in a string formatting function, call
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
  on the field first, then pass the resulting "string" to the
  function.

## [Collecting enum members](https://www.tradingview.com#collecting-enum-members)

Pine Script™ [collections](#collections) ([arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices), and [maps](#maps)) can store enum members, allowing strict control over the values they can contain. To declare a collection of enum members, include the enum's *name* in the collection's [type template](#type-templates).

For example, this code block creates an empty
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
to hold members of the `FooBar` enum. The only values this array can
allow as elements are `FooBar.foo`, `FooBar.bar`, `FooBar.baz`, and
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na):

```
//@variable An enumeration of miscellaneous named members.
enum FooBar
    foo
    bar
    baz

//@variable An array that can only contain the following values: `FooBar.foo`, `FooBar.bar`, `FooBar.baz`, `na`.
array<FooBar> fooBarArray = array.new<FooBar>()
```

Enums are particularly helpful when working with
[maps](#maps), as unlike other
*non-fundamental*[types](#types), scripts can declare [maps](#maps) with *keys* of an
[enum type](#enum-types), enabling strict control over all possible keys allowed in
their key-value pairs.

The following example uses a
[map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
with enum keys and "int" values to track and count signal states
across chart bars. The script's `Signal` enum contains five fields
representing specific named states. The `signalCounters`[map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
uses the `Signal` name as the *first keyword* in its
[type template](#type-templates) to specify that it can only accept `Signal` members as keys.

The script uses a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure to calculate a `signalState` variable whose value is a member
of the `Signal` enum, which it uses to determine the counter value to
update in the `signalCounters` map. It constructs a "string" to
represent the key-value pairs of the
[map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
and displays the result in a single-cell
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
on the last chart bar:

![image](images/Enums-Collecting-enums-1.ZTw8lVuz_1tEOAf.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Collecting enum members demo", overlay = true)

//@enum An enumeration of named signal states. 
enum Signal
    strongBuy  = "Strong buy"
    buy        = "Buy"
    neutral    = "Neutral"
    sell       = "Sell"
    strongSell = "Strong sell"

//@variable The number of bars in the signal calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 2)

//@variable A map of `Signal.*` keys and "int" values counting the number of bars with each signal state. 
//          Allowed keys: `Signal.strongBuy`, `Signal.buy`, `Signal.neutral`, `Signal.sell`, `Signal.strongSell`, `na`.
var map<Signal, float> signalCounters = map.new<Signal, float>()

//@variable A single-cell table displaying the key-value pairs of the `signalCounters` map.
var table infoTable = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1, chart.fg_color)

if barstate.isfirst
    // Put `Signal.*`-"int" pairs into the `signalCounters` map to establish insertion order.
    signalCounters.put(Signal.strongBuy, 0)
    signalCounters.put(Signal.buy, 0)
    signalCounters.put(Signal.neutral, 0)
    signalCounters.put(Signal.sell, 0)
    signalCounters.put(Signal.strongSell, 0)
    // Initialize the `infoTable` cell.
    infoTable.cell(0, 0, text_color = chart.bg_color, text_halign = text.align_left, text_size = size.large)

// Calculate the EMA and Percent rank of `source` data over `length` bars.
float ema  = ta.ema(close, lengthInput)
float rank = ta.percentrank(close, lengthInput)

//@variable A `Signal` member representing the current signal state based on `ema` and `rank` values. 
Signal signalState = switch
    close > ema => rank > 70 ? Signal.strongBuy  : rank > 50 ? Signal.buy  : Signal.neutral
    close < ema => rank < 30 ? Signal.strongSell : rank < 50 ? Signal.sell : Signal.neutral
    => Signal.neutral

// Add 1 to the value in the `signalCounters` map associated with the `signalState` key.
signalCounters.put(signalState, signalCounters.get(signalState) + 1)

// Update the `infoTable` cell's text using the keys and values from the `signalCounters` map on the last bar.
if barstate.islast
    string tableText = ""
    for [state, count] in signalCounters
        tableText += str.tostring(state) + ": " + str.tostring(count) + "\n"
    infoTable.cell_set_text(0, 0, str.trim(tableText))
```

Note that:

- The `signalCounters` map can contain up to *six* key-value
  pairs, as the `Signal` enum has *five* predefined values, plus a
  possible value of
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
  and [maps](#maps) cannot
  contain *repetitive* keys.
- The script declares the `signalCounters` variable using the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword, signifying that the assigned
  [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
  instance persists across executions.
- On the first chart bar, the script uses five
  [map.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
  calls to establish the *insertion order* of keys in the
  `signalCounters` map. See
  [this section](#mapkeys-and-mapvalues) of the [Maps](#maps) page for more information.
- To minimize *resource usage*, the script declares the
  `infoTable` and initializes its cell on the *first bar*, then
  updates the cell's text on the *latest bar*. See
  [this section](#reducing-drawing-updates) of the
  [Profiling and optimization](#profiling-and-optimization) page to learn more.

## [Shadowing](https://www.tradingview.com#shadowing)

In contrast to [user-defined types (UDTs)](#user-defined-types), which can have names that *shadow* some built-in types or namespaces, enum types require *unique* names that do **not** match any built-in types or namespaces.

For example, this code declares four enums named `Syminfo`, `syminfo`, `polyline`, and `ta`. The last three all cause a compilation error because their names match built-in namespaces:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Shadowing demo")

// Naming an enum "Syminfo" with a capital "S" works without an issue. 
enum Syminfo 
    abcd

// In contrast, the names "syminfo", "polyline", "ta", etc. cause a compilation error because they match 
// built-in namespaces:
enum syminfo
    abcd

enum polyline
    abcd

enum ta
    abcd
```

# [Methods](https://www.tradingview.com#methods)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ methods are specialized functions associated with values of specific [built-in types](#types),
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types), or [enum types](#enum-types).
They behave the same as regular functions in most regards while offering a shorter, more convenient syntax.
Users can access methods using *dot notation* syntax on variables of the associated type, similar to accessing the fields
of a Pine Script™ [object](#objects).

## [Built-in methods](https://www.tradingview.com#built-in-methods)

Pine Script™ includes built-in methods for all *special types*,
including
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix),
[map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map),
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
and
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table).
These methods provide users with a more concise way to call specialized
routines for these types within their scripts.

When using these special types, the expressions:

```
<namespace>.<functionName>([paramName =] <objectName>, …)
```

and:

```
<objectName>.<functionName>(…)
```

are equivalent. For example, rather than using:

```
array.get(id, index)
```

to get the value from an array `id` at the specified `index`, we can
simply use:

```
id.get(index)
```

to achieve the same effect. This notation eliminates the need for users
to reference the function's namespace, as
[get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get)
is a method of `id` in this context.

Written below is a practical example to demonstrate the usage of
built-in methods in place of functions.

The following script computes Bollinger Bands over a specified number of
prices sampled once every `n` bars. It calls
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
and
[array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
to queue `sourceInput` values through the `sourceArray`, then
[array.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg)
and
[array.stdev()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.stdev)
to compute the `sampleMean` and `sampleDev`. The script then uses these
values to calculate the `highBand` and `lowBand`, which it plots on the
chart along with the `sampleMean`:

![image](images/Methods_custom_bb.DR1SlFGg_2tQfSW.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Custom Sample BB", overlay = true)

float sourceInput  = input.source(close, "Source")
int   samplesInput = input.int(20, "Samples")
int   n            = input.int(10, "Bars")
float multiplier   = input.float(2.0, "StdDev")

var array<float> sourceArray = array.new<float>(samplesInput)
var float        sampleMean  = na
var float        sampleDev   = na

// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar_index % n == 0
    // Update the queue.
    array.push(sourceArray, sourceInput)
    array.shift(sourceArray)
    // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
    sampleMean := array.avg(sourceArray)
    sampleDev  := array.stdev(sourceArray) * multiplier

// Calculate bands.
float highBand = sampleMean + sampleDev
float lowBand  = sampleMean - sampleDev

plot(sampleMean, "Basis", color.orange)
plot(highBand, "Upper", color.lime)
plot(lowBand, "Lower", color.red)
```

Let's rewrite this code to utilize methods rather than built-in
functions. In this version, we have replaced all built-in
[array.*](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
functions in the script with equivalent methods:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Custom Sample BB", overlay = true)

float sourceInput  = input.source(close, "Source")
int   samplesInput = input.int(20, "Samples")
int   n            = input.int(10, "Bars")
float multiplier   = input.float(2.0, "StdDev")

var array<float> sourceArray = array.new<float>(samplesInput)
var float        sampleMean  = na
var float        sampleDev   = na

// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar_index % n == 0
    // Update the queue.
    sourceArray.push(sourceInput)
    sourceArray.shift()
    // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
    sampleMean := sourceArray.avg()
    sampleDev  := sourceArray.stdev() * multiplier

// Calculate band values.
float highBand = sampleMean + sampleDev
float lowBand  = sampleMean - sampleDev

plot(sampleMean, "Basis", color.orange)
plot(highBand, "Upper", color.lime)
plot(lowBand, "Lower", color.red)
```

Note that:

- We call the array methods using `sourceArray.*` rather than
  referencing the
  [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
  namespace.
- We do not include `sourceArray` as a parameter when we call the
  methods since they already reference the object.

## [User-defined methods](https://www.tradingview.com#user-defined-methods)

Pine Script™ allows users to define custom methods for use with objects
of any built-in or user-defined type. Defining a method is essentially
the same as defining a function, but with two key differences:

- The
  [method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_method)
  keyword must be included before the function name.
- The type of the first parameter in the signature must be explicitly
  declared, as it represents the type of object that the method will
  be associated with.

```
[export] method <functionName>(<paramType> <paramName> [= <defaultValue>], …) =>    <functionBlock>
```

Let's apply user-defined methods to our previous Bollinger Bands
example to encapsulate operations from the global scope, which will
simplify the code and promote reusability. See this portion from the
example:

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar_index % n == 0
    // Update the queue.
    sourceArray.push(sourceInput)
    sourceArray.shift()
    // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
    sampleMean := sourceArray.avg()
    sampleDev  := sourceArray.stdev() * multiplier

// Calculate band values.
float highBand = sampleMean + sampleDev
float lowBand  = sampleMean - sampleDev
```

We will start by defining a simple method to queue values through an
array in a single call.

This `maintainQueue()` method invokes the
[push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
and
[shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
methods on a `srcArray` when `takeSample` is true and returns the
object:

```
// @function         Maintains a queue of the size of `srcArray`. 
//                   It appends a `value` to the array and removes its oldest element at position zero.
// @param srcArray   (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param value      (float) The new value to be added to the queue. 
//                   The queue's oldest value is also removed, so its size is constant.
// @param takeSample (bool) A new `value` is only pushed into the queue if this is true.
// @returns          (array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method maintainQueue(array<float> srcArray, float value, bool takeSample = true) =>
    if takeSample
        srcArray.push(value)
        srcArray.shift()
    srcArray
```

Note that:

- Just as with user-defined functions, we use the `@function`[compiler annotation](#compiler-annotations) to document method descriptions.

Now we can replace `sourceArray.push()` and `sourceArray.shift()` with
`sourceArray.maintainQueue()` in our example:

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar_index % n == 0
    // Update the queue.
    sourceArray.maintainQueue(sourceInput)
    // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
    sampleMean  := sourceArray.avg()
    sampleDev   := sourceArray.stdev() * multiplier

// Calculate band values.
float highBand  = sampleMean + sampleDev
float lowBand   = sampleMean - sampleDev
```

From here, we will further simplify our code by defining a method that
handles all Bollinger Band calculations within its scope.

This `calcBB()` method invokes the
[avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg)
and
[stdev()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.stdev)
methods on a `srcArray` to update `mean` and `dev` values when
`calculate` is true. The method uses these values to return a tuple
containing the basis, upper band, and lower band values respectively:

```
// @function         Computes Bollinger Band values from an array of data.
// @param srcArray   (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param multiplier (float) Standard deviaiton multiplier.
// @param calcuate   (bool) The method will only calculate new values when this is true.
// @returns          A tuple containing the basis, upper band, and lower band respectively.
method calcBB(array<float> srcArray, float mult, bool calculate = true) =>
    var float mean = na
    var float dev  = na
    if calculate
        // Compute the mean and standard deviation of the array.
        mean := srcArray.avg()
        dev  := srcArray.stdev() * mult
    [mean, mean + dev, mean - dev]
```

With this method, we can now remove Bollinger Band calculations from the
global scope and improve code readability:

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
bool newSample = bar_index % n == 0

// Update the queue and compute new BB values on each new sample.
[sampleMean, highBand, lowBand] = sourceArray.maintainQueue(sourceInput, newSample).calcBB(multiplier, newSample)
```

Note that:

- Rather than using an `if` block in the global scope, we have
  defined a `newSample` variable that is only true once every `n`
  bars. The `maintainQueue()` and `calcBB()` methods use this
  value for their respective `takeSample` and `calculate`
  parameters.
- Since the `maintainQueue()` method returns the object that it
  references, we're able to call `calcBB()` from the same line of
  code, as both methods apply to `array<float>` instances.

Here is how the full script example looks now that we've applied our
user-defined methods:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Custom Sample BB", overlay = true)

float sourceInput  = input.source(close, "Source")
int   samplesInput = input.int(20, "Samples")
int   n            = input.int(10, "Bars")
float multiplier   = input.float(2.0, "StdDev")

var array<float> sourceArray = array.new<float>(samplesInput)

// @function         Maintains a queue of the size of `srcArray`. 
//                   It appends a `value` to the array and removes its oldest element at position zero.
// @param srcArray   (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param value      (float) The new value to be added to the queue. 
//                   The queue's oldest value is also removed, so its size is constant.
// @param takeSample (bool) A new `value` is only pushed into the queue if this is true.
// @returns          (array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method maintainQueue(array<float> srcArray, float value, bool takeSample = true) =>
    if takeSample
        srcArray.push(value)
        srcArray.shift()
    srcArray

// @function         Computes Bollinger Band values from an array of data.
// @param srcArray   (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param multiplier (float) Standard deviaiton multiplier.
// @param calcuate   (bool) The method will only calculate new values when this is true.
// @returns          A tuple containing the basis, upper band, and lower band respectively.
method calcBB(array<float> srcArray, float mult, bool calculate = true) =>
    var float mean = na
    var float dev  = na
    if calculate
        // Compute the mean and standard deviation of the array.
        mean := srcArray.avg()
        dev  := srcArray.stdev() * mult
    [mean, mean + dev, mean - dev]

// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
bool newSample = bar_index % n == 0

// Update the queue and compute new BB values on each new sample.
[sampleMean, highBand, lowBand] = sourceArray.maintainQueue(sourceInput, newSample).calcBB(multiplier, newSample)

plot(sampleMean, "Basis", color.orange)
plot(highBand, "Upper", color.lime)
plot(lowBand, "Lower", color.red)
```

## [Method overloading](https://www.tradingview.com#method-overloading)

User-defined methods can override and overload existing built-in and
user-defined methods with the same identifier. This capability allows
users to define multiple routines associated with different parameter
signatures under the same method name.

As a simple example, suppose we want to define a method to identify a
variable's type. Since we must explicitly specify the type of object
associated with a user-defined method, we will need to define overloads
for each type that we want it to recognize.

Below, we have defined a `getType()` method that returns a string
representation of a variable's type with overloads for the five
primitive types:

```
// @function   Identifies an object's type.
// @param this Object to inspect.
// @returns    (string) A string representation of the type.
method getType(int this) =>
    na(this) ? "int(na)" : "int"

method getType(float this) =>
    na(this) ? "float(na)" : "float"

method getType(bool this) =>
    // "bool" values only have two states, `true` and `false`, but never `na`.
    "bool"

method getType(color this) =>
    na(this) ? "color(na)" : "color"

method getType(string this) =>
    na(this) ? "string(na)" : "string"
```

Now we can use these overloads to inspect some variables. This script
uses
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
to format the results from calling the `getType()` method on five
different variables into a single `results` string, then displays the
string in the `lbl` label using the built-in
[set_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.set_text)
method:

![image](images/Methods_overloads_type_inspection.BxAK0zpG_2p2qvn.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Type Inspection")

// @function   Identifies an object's type.
// @param this Object to inspect.
// @returns    (string) A string representation of the type.
method getType(int this) =>
    na(this) ? "int(na)" : "int"

method getType(float this) =>
    na(this) ? "float(na)" : "float"

method getType(bool this) =>
    na(this) ? "bool(na)" : "bool"

method getType(color this) =>
    na(this) ? "color(na)" : "color"

method getType(string this) =>
    na(this) ? "string(na)" : "string"

a = 1
b = 1.0
c = true
d = color.white
e = "1"

// Inspect variables and format results.
results = str.format(
 "a: {0}\nb: {1}\nc: {2}\nd: {3}\ne: {4}", 
 a.getType(), b.getType(), c.getType(), d.getType(), e.getType()
 )

var label lbl = label.new(0, 0)
lbl.set_x(bar_index)
lbl.set_text(results)
```

Note that:

- The underlying type of each variable determines which overload
  of `getType()` the compiler will use.
- The method will append "(na)" to the output string when a
  variable is `na` to demarcate that it is empty.

## [Advanced example](https://www.tradingview.com#advanced-example)

Let's apply what we've learned to construct a script that estimates
the cumulative distribution of elements in an array, meaning the
fraction of elements in the array that are less than or equal to any
given value.

There are many ways in which we could choose to tackle this objective.
For this example, we will start by defining a method to replace elements
of an array, which will help us count the occurrences of elements within
a range of values.

Written below is an overload of the built-in
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.fill)
method for `array<float>` instances. This overload replaces elements in
a `srcArray` within the range between the `lowerBound` and `upperBound`
with an `innerValue`, and replaces all elements outside the range with
an `outerValue`:

```
// @function          Replaces elements in a `srcArray` between `lowerBound` and `upperBound` with an `innerValue`,
//                    and replaces elements outside the range with an `outerValue`.
// @param srcArray    (array<float>) Array to modify.
// @param innerValue  (float) Value to replace elements within the range with.
// @param outerValue  (float) Value to replace elements outside the range with.
// @param lowerBound  (float) Lowest value to replace with `innerValue`.
// @param upperBound  (float) Highest value to replace with `innerValue`.
// @returns           (array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method fill(array<float> srcArray, float innerValue, float outerValue, float lowerBound, float upperBound) =>
    for [i, element] in srcArray
        if (element >= lowerBound or na(lowerBound)) and (element <= upperBound or na(upperBound))
            srcArray.set(i, innerValue)
        else
            srcArray.set(i, outerValue)
    srcArray
```

With this method, we can filter an array by value ranges to produce an
array of occurrences. For example, the expression:

```
srcArray.copy().fill(1.0, 0.0, min, val)
```

copies the `srcArray` object, replaces all elements between `min` and
`val` with 1.0, then replaces all elements above `val` with 0.0. From
here, it's easy to estimate the output of the cumulative distribution
function at the `val`, as it's simply the average of the resulting
array:

```
srcArray.copy().fill(1.0, 0.0, min, val).avg()
```

Note that:

- The compiler will only use this `fill()` overload instead of the
  built-in when the user provides `innerValue`, `outerValue`,
  `lowerBound`, and `upperBound` arguments in the call.
- If either `lowerBound` or `upperBound` is `na`, its value is
  ignored while filtering the fill range.
- We are able to call `copy()`, `fill()`, and `avg()` successively
  on the same line of code because the first two methods return an
  `array<float>` instance.

We can now use this to define a method that will calculate our empirical
distribution values. The following `eCDF()` method estimates a number of
evenly spaced ascending `steps` from the cumulative distribution
function of a `srcArray` and pushes the results into a `cdfArray`:

```
// @function       Estimates the empirical CDF of a `srcArray`.
// @param srcArray (array<float>) Array to calculate on.
// @param steps    (int) Number of steps in the estimation.
// @returns        (array<float>) Array of estimated CDF ratios.
method eCDF(array<float> srcArray, int steps) =>
    float min = srcArray.min()
    float rng = srcArray.range() / steps
    array<float> cdfArray = array.new<float>()
    // Add averages of `srcArray` filtered by value region to the `cdfArray`.
    float val = min
    for i = 1 to steps
        val += rng
        cdfArray.push(srcArray.copy().fill(1.0, 0.0, min, val).avg())
    cdfArray
```

Lastly, to ensure that our `eCDF()` method functions properly for arrays
containing small and large values, we will define a method to normalize
our arrays.

This `featureScale()` method uses array
[min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min)
and
[range()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.range)
methods to produce a rescaled copy of a `srcArray`. We will use this to
normalize our arrays prior to invoking the `eCDF()` method:

```
// @function        Rescales the elements within a `srcArray` to the interval [0, 1].
// @param srcArray  (array<float>) Array to normalize.
// @returns         (array<float>) Normalized copy of the `srcArray`.
method featureScale(array<float> srcArray) =>
    float min = srcArray.min()
    float rng = srcArray.range()
    array<float> scaledArray = array.new<float>()
    // Push normalized `element` values into the `scaledArray`.
    for element in srcArray
        scaledArray.push((element - min) / rng)
    scaledArray
```

Note that:

- This method does not include special handling for divide by zero
  conditions. If `rng` is 0, the value of the array element will
  be `na`.

The full example below queues a `sourceArray` of size `length` with
`sourceInput` values using our previous `maintainQueue()` method,
normalizes the array's elements using the `featureScale()` method, then
calls the `eCDF()` method to get an array of estimates for `n` evenly
spaced steps on the distribution. The script then calls a user-defined
`makeLabel()` function to display the estimates and prices in a label on
the right side of the chart:

![image](images/Methods_empirical_distribution.BdS9hiv6_Z1t1cl8.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Empirical Distribution", overlay = true)

float sourceInput = input.source(close, "Source")
int length        = input.int(20, "Length")
int n             = input.int(20, "Steps")

// @function         Maintains a queue of the size of `srcArray`. 
//                   It appends a `value` to the array and removes its oldest element at position zero.
// @param srcArray   (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param value      (float) The new value to be added to the queue. 
//                   The queue's oldest value is also removed, so its size is constant.
// @param takeSample (bool) A new `value` is only pushed into the queue if this is true.
// @returns          (array<float>) `srcArray` object.

# [Arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#arrays)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ Arrays are one-dimensional collections that can hold
multiple value references. Think of them as a better way to handle cases
where one would otherwise need to explicitly declare a set of similar
variables (e.g., `price00`, `price01`, `price02`, …).

All elements in an array must be of the same [built-in type](#types), [user-defined type](#user-defined-types), or [enum type](#enum-types).

Scripts reference arrays using array IDs similar to the IDs of [lines](#lines), [labels](#labels), and other *special types*. Pine Script™ does not use an indexing operator to reference individual array elements.
Instead, functions including [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get) and [array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set) read and write the values of array elements.

Scripts reference the elements of an array using an *index*, which
starts at 0 and extends to the number of elements in the array minus
one. Arrays in Pine Script™ can have a dynamic size that varies across
bars, as one can change the number of elements in an array on each
iteration of a script. Scripts can contain multiple array instances. The
size of arrays is limited to 100,000 elements.

## [Declaring arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#declaring-arrays)

Pine Script™ uses the following syntax to declare arrays:

```
[var/varip ][array<type>/<type[]> ]<identifier> = <expression>
```

Where `<type>` is a
[type template](#type-templates) for the array that declares the type of values it will
contain, and the `<expression>` returns either an array of the specified
type or `na`.

When declaring a variable as an array, we can use the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
keyword followed by a
[type template](#type-templates). Alternatively, we can use the `type` name followed by the
`[]` modifier (not to be confused with the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)*history-referencing operator*).

Since Pine always uses type-specific functions to create arrays, the
`array<type>/type[]` part of the declaration is redundant, except when
declaring an array variable assigned to `na`. Even when not required,
explicitly declaring the array type helps clearly state the intention to
readers.

This line of code declares an array variable named `prices` that points
to `na`. In this case, we must specify the type to declare that the
variable can reference arrays containing "float" values:

```
array<float> prices = na
```

We can also write the above example in this form:

```
float[] prices = na
```

When declaring an array and the `<expression>` is not `na`, use one of
the following functions: [array.new<type>(size, initial_value)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.new%3Ctype%3E),
[array.from()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.from),
or
[array.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.copy).
For `array.new<type>(size, initial_value)` functions, the arguments of
the `size` and `initial_value` parameters can be "series" to allow
dynamic sizing and initialization of array elements. The following
example creates an array containing zero "float" elements, and this
time, the array ID returned by the [array.new<float>()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.new%3Ctype%3E)
function call is assigned to `prices`:

```
prices = array.new<float>(0)
```

The `initial_value` parameter of `array.new*` functions allows users to
set all elements in the array to a specified value. If no argument is
provided for `initial_value`, the array is filled with `na` values.

This line declares an array ID named `prices` pointing to an array
containing two elements, each assigned to the bar's `close` value:

```
prices = array.new<float>(2, close)
```

To create an array and initialize its elements with different values,
use
[array.from()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.from).
This function infers the array's size and the type of elements it will
hold from the arguments in the function call. As with `array.new*`
functions, it accepts "series" arguments. All values supplied to the
function must be of the same type.

For example, all three of these lines of code will create identical
"bool" arrays with the same two elements:

```
statesArray = array.from(close > open, high != close)
bool[] statesArray = array.from(close > open, high != close)
array<bool> statesArray = array.from(close > open, high != close)
```

### [Using `var` and `varip` keywords](https://www.tradingview.com#using-var-and-varip-keywords)

Users can utilize
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) and
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keywords to instruct a script to declare an array variable only once on
the first iteration of the script on the first chart bar. Array
variables declared using these keywords point to the same array
instances until explicitly reassigned, allowing an array and its element
references to persist across bars.

When declaring an array variable using these keywords and pushing a new
value to the end of the referenced array on each bar, the array will
grow by one on each bar and be of size `bar_index + 1`
([bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
starts at zero) by the time the script executes on the last bar, as this
code demonstrates:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Using `var`")
//@variable An array that expands its size by 1 on each bar.
var a = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(a, close)

if barstate.islast
    //@variable A string containing the size of `a` and the current `bar_index` value.
    string labelText = "Array size: " + str.tostring(a.size()) + "\nbar_index: " + str.tostring(bar_index)
    // Display the `labelText`.
    label.new(bar_index, 0, labelText, size = size.large)
```

The same code without the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword would re-declare the array on each bar. In this case, after
execution of the
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
call, the
[a.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
call would return a value of 1.

## [Reading and writing array elements](https://www.tradingview.com#reading-and-writing-array-elements)

Scripts can write values to existing individual array elements using
[array.set(id, index,
value)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set),
and read using [array.get(id,
index)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get).
When using these functions, it is imperative that the `index` in the
function call is always less than or equal to the array's size (because
array indices start at zero). To get the size of an array, use the
[array.size(id)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
function.

The following example uses the
[set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set)
method to populate a `fillColors` array with instances of one base color
using different transparency levels. It then uses
[array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get)
to retrieve one of the colors from the array based on the location of
the bar with the highest price within the last `lookbackInput` bars:

![image](images/Arrays-ReadingAndWriting-DistanceFromHigh.B8Ur_B4a_Z1HV6bi.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Distance from high", "", true)
lookbackInput = input.int(100)
FILL_COLOR = color.green
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
var fillColors = array.new<color>(5)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill color.
    fillColors.set(0, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
    fillColors.set(1, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    fillColors.set(2, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    fillColors.set(3, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    fillColors.set(4, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))

// Find the offset to highest high. Change its sign because the function returns a negative value.
lastHiBar = - ta.highestbars(high, lookbackInput)
// Convert the offset to an array index, capping it to 4 to avoid a runtime error.
// The index used by `array.get()` will be the equivalent of `floor(fillNo)`.
fillNo = math.min(lastHiBar / (lookbackInput / 5), 4)
// Set background to a progressively lighter fill with increasing distance from location of highest high.
bgcolor(array.get(fillColors, fillNo))
// Plot key values to the Data Window for debugging.
plotchar(lastHiBar, "lastHiBar", "", location.top, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(fillNo, "fillNo", "", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

Another technique for initializing the elements in an array is to create
an *empty array* (an array with no elements), then use
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
to append **new** elements to the end of the array, increasing the size
of the array by one on each call. The following code is functionally
identical to the initialization section from the preceding script:

```
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
var fillColors = array.new<color>(0)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill color.
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))
```

This code is equivalent to the one above, but it uses
[array.unshift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.unshift)
to insert new elements at the *beginning* of the `fillColors` array:

```
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
var fillColors = array.new<color>(0)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill color.
    array.unshift(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))
    array.unshift(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    array.unshift(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    array.unshift(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    array.unshift(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
```

We can also use
[array.from()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.from)
to create the same `fillColors` array with a single function call:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Using `var`")
FILL_COLOR = color.green
var array<color> fillColors = array.from(
     color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70),
     color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75),
     color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80),
     color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85),
     color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90)
 )
// Cycle background through the array's colors.
bgcolor(array.get(fillColors, bar_index % (fillColors.size())))
```

The [array.fill(id, value, index_from,
index_to)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.fill)
function points all array elements, or the elements within the
`index_from` to `index_to` range, to a specified `value`. Without the
last two optional parameters, the function fills the whole array, so:

```
a = array.new<float>(10, close)
```

and:

```
a = array.new<float>(10)
a.fill(close)
```

are equivalent, but:

```
a = array.new<float>(10)
a.fill(close, 1, 3)
```

only fills the second and third elements (at index 1 and 2) of the array
with `close`. Note how
[array.fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.fill)'s
last parameter, `index_to`, must be one greater than the last index the
function will fill. The remaining elements will hold `na` values, as the
[array.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.new%3Ctype%3E)
function call does not contain an `initial_value` argument.

## [Looping through array elements](https://www.tradingview.com#looping-through-array-elements)

When looping through an array's element indices and the array's size
is unknown, one can use the
[array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
function to get the maximum index value. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Protected `for` loop", overlay = true)
//@variable An array of `close` prices from the 1-minute timeframe.
array<float> a = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close)

//@variable A string representation of the elements in `a`.
string labelText = ""
for i = 0 to (array.size(a) == 0 ? na : array.size(a) - 1)
    labelText += str.tostring(array.get(a, i)) + "\n"

label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
```

Note that:

- We use the
  [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
  function which returns an array of
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  prices at the `1 minute` timeframe.
- This code example will throw an error if you use it on a chart
  timeframe smaller than `1 minute`.
- [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)
  loops do not execute if the `to` expression is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).
  Note that the `to` value is only evaluated once upon entry.

An alternative method to loop through an array is to use a
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop. This approach is a variation of the standard for loop that can
iterate over the value references and indices in an array. Here is an
example of how we can write the code example from above using a
`for...in` loop:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`for...in` loop", overlay = true)
//@variable An array of `close` prices from the 1-minute timeframe.
array<float> a = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close)

//@variable A string representation of the elements in `a`.
string labelText = ""
for price in a
    labelText += str.tostring(price) + "\n"

label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
```

Note that:

- [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
  loops can return a tuple containing each index and corresponding
  element. For example, `for [i, price] in a` returns the `i`
  index and `price` value for each element in `a`.

A
[while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while)
loop statement can also be used:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`while` loop", overlay = true)
array<float> a = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close)

string labelText = ""
int i = 0
while i < array.size(a)
    labelText += str.tostring(array.get(a, i)) + "\n"
    i += 1

label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
```

## [Scope](https://www.tradingview.com#scope)

Users can declare arrays within the global scope of a script, as well as
the local scopes of
[functions](#user-defined-functions),
[methods](#methods), and
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures). Unlike some of the other built-in types, namely
*fundamental* types, scripts can modify globally-assigned arrays from
within local scopes, allowing users to implement global variables that
any function in the script can directly interact with. We use the
functionality here to calculate progressively lower or higher price
levels:

![image](images/Arrays-Scope-Bands.BasWVnm1_2v9lBn.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Bands", "", true)
//@variable The distance ratio between plotted price levels.
factorInput = 1 + (input.float(-2., "Step %") / 100)
//@variable A single-value array holding the lowest `ohlc4` value within a 50 bar window from 10 bars back.
level = array.new<float>(1, ta.lowest(ohlc4, 50)[10])

nextLevel(val) =>
    newLevel = level.get(0) * val
    // Write new level to the global `level` array so we can use it as the base in the next function call.
    level.set(0, newLevel)
    newLevel

plot(nextLevel(1))
plot(nextLevel(factorInput))
plot(nextLevel(factorInput))
plot(nextLevel(factorInput))
```

## [History referencing](https://www.tradingview.com#history-referencing)

Pine Script™'s history-referencing operator [[
]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D) can
access the history of array variables, allowing scripts to interact with
past array instances previously assigned to a variable.

To illustrate this, let's create a simple example to show how one can
fetch the previous bar's `close` value in two equivalent ways. This
script uses the [[
]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
operator to get the array instance assigned to `a` on the previous bar,
then uses the
[get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get)
method to retrieve the value of the first element (`previousClose1`).
For `previousClose2`, we use the history-referencing operator on the
`close` variable directly to retrieve the value. As we see from the
plots, `previousClose1` and `previousClose2` both return the same value:

![image](images/Arrays-History-referencing.D1DIjFIM_Z23jPGQ.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("History referencing")

//@variable A single-value array declared on each bar.
a = array.new<float>(1)
// Set the value of the only element in `a` to `close`.
array.set(a, 0, close)

//@variable The array instance assigned to `a` on the previous bar.
previous = a[1]

previousClose1 = na(previous) ? na : previous.get(0)
previousClose2 = close[1]

plot(previousClose1, "previousClose1", color.gray, 6)
plot(previousClose2, "previousClose2", color.white, 2)
```

## [Inserting and removing array elements](https://www.tradingview.com#inserting-and-removing-array-elements)

### [Inserting](https://www.tradingview.com#inserting)

The following three functions can insert new elements into an array.

[array.unshift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.unshift)
inserts a new element at the beginning of an array (index 0) and
increases the index values of any existing elements by one.

[array.insert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.insert)
inserts a new element at the specified `index` and increases the index
of existing elements at or after the `index` by one.

![image](images/Arrays-InsertingAndRemovingArrayElements-Insert.jdY5CZ2M_Z1kDUQL.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`array.insert()`")
a = array.new<float>(5, 0)
for i = 0 to 4
    array.set(a, i, i + 1)
if barstate.islast
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "BEFORE\na: " + str.tostring(a), size = size.large)
    array.insert(a, 2, 999)    
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "AFTER\na: " + str.tostring(a), style = label.style_label_up, size = size.large)
```

[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
adds a new element at the end of an array.

### [Removing](https://www.tradingview.com#removing)

These four functions remove elements from an array. The first three also
return the value of the removed element.

[array.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.remove)
removes the element at the specified `index` and returns that element's
value.

[array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
removes the first element from an array and returns its value.

[array.pop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.pop)
removes the last element of an array and returns its value.

[array.clear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.clear)
removes all elements from an array. Note that clearing an array won't
delete any objects its elements referenced. See the example below that
illustrates how this works:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`array.clear()` example", overlay = true)

// Create a label array and add a label to the array on each new bar.
var a = array.new<label>()
label lbl = label.new(bar_index, high, "Text", color = color.red)
array.push(a, lbl)

var table t = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
// Clear the array on the last bar. This doesn't remove the labels from the chart. 
if barstate.islast
    array.clear(a)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, "Array elements count: " + str.tostring(array.size(a)), bgcolor = color.yellow)
```

### [Using an array as a stack](https://www.tradingview.com#using-an-array-as-a-stack)

Stacks are LIFO (last in, first out) constructions. They behave somewhat
like a vertical pile of books to which books can only be added or
removed one at a time, always from the top. Pine Script™ arrays can be
used as a stack, in which case we use the
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
and
[array.pop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.pop)
functions to add and remove elements at the end of the array.

`array.push(prices, close)` will add a new element to the end of the
`prices` array, increasing the array's size by one.

`array.pop(prices)` will remove the end element from the `prices` array,
return its value and decrease the array's size by one.

See how the functions are used here to track successive lows in rallies:

![image](images/Arrays-InsertingAndRemovingArrayElements-LowsFromNewHighs.V3h-ojnF_Z1hO9xN.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Lows from new highs", "", true)
var lows = array.new<float>(0)
flushLows = false

//@function Removes the last element from the `id` stack when `cond` is `true`.
array_pop(id, cond) => cond and array.size(id) > 0 ? array.pop(id) : float(na)

if ta.rising(high, 1)
    // Rising highs; push a new low on the stack.
    lows.push(low)
    // Force the return type of this `if` block to be the same as that of the next block.
    bool(na)
else if lows.size() >= 4 or low < array.min(lows)
    // We have at least 4 lows or price has breached the lowest low;
    // sort lows and set flag indicating we will plot and flush the levels.
    array.sort(lows, order.ascending)
    flushLows := true

// If needed, plot and flush lows.
lowLevel = array_pop(lows, flushLows)
plot(lowLevel, "Low 1", low > lowLevel ? color.silver : color.purple, 2, plot.style_linebr)
lowLevel := array_pop(lows, flushLows)
plot(lowLevel, "Low 2", low > lowLevel ? color.silver : color.purple, 3, plot.style_linebr)
lowLevel := array_pop(lows, flushLows)
plot(lowLevel, "Low 3", low > lowLevel ? color.silver : color.purple, 4, plot.style_linebr)
lowLevel := array_pop(lows, flushLows)
plot(lowLevel, "Low 4", low > lowLevel ? color.silver : color.purple, 5, plot.style_linebr)

if flushLows
    // Clear remaining levels after the last 4 have been plotted.
    lows.clear()
```

### [Using an array as a queue](https://www.tradingview.com#using-an-array-as-a-queue)

Queues are FIFO (first in, first out) constructions. They behave
somewhat like cars arriving at a red light. New cars are queued at the
end of the line, and the first car to leave will be the first one that
arrived to the red light.

In the following code example, we let users decide through the script's
inputs how many labels they want to have on their chart. We use that
quantity to determine the size of the array of labels we then create,
initializing the array's elements to `na`.

When a new pivot is detected, we create a label for it, saving the
label's ID in the `pLabel` variable. We then queue the ID of that label
by using
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
to append the new label's ID to the end of the array, making our array
size one greater than the maximum number of labels to keep on the chart.

Lastly, we de-queue the oldest label by removing the array's first
element using
[array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
and deleting the label referenced by that array element's value. As we
have now de-queued an element from our queue, the array contains
`pivotCountInput` elements once again. Note that on the dataset's first
bars we will be deleting `na` label IDs until the maximum number of
labels has been created, but this does not cause runtime errors. Let's
look at our code:

![image](images/Arrays-InsertingAndRemovingArrayElements-ShowLastnHighPivots.WcryVum8_201EAB.png)

```
//@version=6
MAX_LABELS = 100
indicator("Show Last n High Pivots", "", true, max_labels_count = MAX_LABELS)

pivotCountInput = input.int(5, "How many pivots to show", minval = 0, maxval = MAX_LABELS)
pivotLegsInput  = input.int(3, "Pivot legs", minval = 1, maxval = 5)

// Create an array containing the user-selected max count of label IDs.
var labelIds = array.new<label>(pivotCountInput)

pHi = ta.pivothigh(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput)
if not na(pHi)
    // New pivot found; plot its label `pivotLegsInput` bars behind the current `bar_index`.
    pLabel = label.new(bar_index - pivotLegsInput, pHi, str.tostring(pHi, format.mintick), textcolor = color.white)
    // Queue the new label's ID by appending it to the end of the array.
    array.push(labelIds, pLabel)
    // De-queue the oldest label ID from the queue and delete the corresponding label.
    label.delete(array.shift(labelIds))
```

## [Negative indexing](https://www.tradingview.com#negative-indexing)

The [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get), [array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set), [array.insert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.insert), and [array.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.remove) functions support *negative indexing*, which references elements starting from the end of the array. An index of `-1` refers to the last element in the array, an index of `-2` refers to the second to last element, and so on.

When using a *positive* index, functions traverse the array *forwards* from the beginning of the array (*first to last* element). The first element's index is `0`, and the last element's index is `array.size() - 1`. When using a *negative* index, functions traverse the array *backwards* from the end of the array (*last to first* element). The last element's index is `-1`, and the first element's index is `–array.size()`:

```
array<string> myArray = array.from("first", "second", "third", "fourth", "last")

// Positive indexing: Indexes forwards from the beginning of the array.
myArray.get(0)                        // Returns "first" element
myArray.get(myArray.size() - 1)       // Returns "last" element
myArray.get(4)                        // Returns "last" element

// Negative indexing: Indexes backwards from the end of the array.
myArray.get(-1)                       // Returns "last" element
myArray.get(-myArray.size())          // Returns "first" element
myArray.get(-5)                       // Returns "first" element
```

Like positive indexing, negative indexing is bound by the size of the array. For example, functions operating on an array of 5 elements only accept indices of 0 to 4 (first to last element) or -1 to -5 (last to first element). Any other indices are [out of bounds](#index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-array-size-is-yy) and will raise a runtime error.

We can use negative indices to retrieve, update, add, and remove array elements. This simple script creates an "int" `countingArray` and calls the [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get), [array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set), [array.insert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.insert), and [array.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.remove) functions to perform various array operations using negative indices. It displays each array operation and its corresponding result in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.new):

![image](images/Arrays-Negative-indexing-1.BuqdF9oM_1glV1g.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Negative indexing demo", overlay = false)

//@variable A `table` that displays various array operations and their results.
var table displayTable = table.new(
     position.middle_center, 2, 15, bgcolor = color.white, 
     frame_color = color.black, frame_width = 1, border_width = 1
 )

//@function Initializes a `displayTable` row to output a "string" of an `arrayOperation` and the `operationResult`.
displayRow(int rowID, string arrayOperation, operationResult) =>
    //@variable Is white if the `rowID` is even, light blue otherwise. Used to set alternating table row colors.
    color rowColor = rowID % 2 == 0 ? color.white : color.rgb(33, 149, 243, 75)
    // Display the `arrayOperation` in the row's first cell.
    displayTable.cell(0, rowID, arrayOperation, text_color = color.black, 
         text_halign = text.align_left, bgcolor = rowColor, text_font_family = font.family_monospace
     )
    // Display the `operationResult` in the row's second cell.
    displayTable.cell(1, rowID, str.tostring(operationResult), text_color = color.black, 
         text_halign = text.align_right, bgcolor = rowColor
     )

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable Array of "int" numbers. Holds six multiples of 10, counting from 10 to 60.
    array<int> countingArray = array.from(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)

    // Initialize the table's header cells.
    displayTable.cell(0, 0, "ARRAY OPERATION")
    displayTable.cell(1, 0, "RESULT")

    // Display the initial `countingArray` values.
    displayTable.cell(0, 1, "Initial `countingArray`", 
         text_color = color.black, text_halign = text.align_center, bgcolor = color.yellow)
    displayTable.cell(1, 1, str.tostring(countingArray), 
         text_color = color.black, text_halign = text.align_right, bgcolor = color.yellow)

    // Retrieve array elements using negative indices in `array.get()`.
    displayRow(2, "`countingArray.get(0)`", countingArray.get(0))
    displayRow(3, "`countingArray.get(-1)`", countingArray.get(-1))
    displayRow(4, "`countingArray.get(-countingArray.size())`", countingArray.get(-countingArray.size()))

    // Update array elements using negative indices in `array.set()` and `array.insert()`.
    countingArray.set(-2, 99)
    displayRow(5, "`countingArray.set(-2, 99)`", countingArray)

    countingArray.insert(-5, 878)
    displayRow(6, "`countingArray.insert(-5, 878)`", countingArray)

    // Remove array elements using negative indices in `array.remove()`.
    countingArray.remove(-3)
    displayRow(7, "`countingArray.remove(-3)`", countingArray)
```

Note that not all array operations can use negative indices. For example, [search functions](#searching-arrays) like [array.indexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.indexof) and [array.binary_search()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.binary_search) return the *positive* index of an element if it's found in the array. If the value is not found, the functions return `-1`. However, this returned value is **not** a negative index, and using it as one would incorrectly reference the last array element. If a script needs to use a search function's returned index in subsequent array operations, it must appropriately differentiate between this `-1` result and other valid indices.

## [Calculations on arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#calculations-on-arrays)

While series variables can be viewed as a horizontal set of values
stretching back in time, Pine Script™'s one-dimensional arrays can be
viewed as vertical structures residing on each bar. As an array's set
of elements is not a
[time series](#time-series),
Pine Script™'s usual mathematical functions are not allowed on them.
Special-purpose functions must be used to operate on all of an array's
values. The available functions are:
[array.abs()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.abs),
[array.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg),
[array.covariance()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.covariance),
[array.min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min),
[array.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.max),
[array.median()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.median),
[array.mode()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.mode),
[array.percentile_linear_interpolation()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.percentile_linear_interpolation),
[array.percentile_nearest_rank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.percentile_nearest_rank),
[array.percentrank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.percentrank),
[array.range()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.range),
[array.standardize()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.standardize),
[array.stdev()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.stdev),
[array.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.sum),
[array.variance()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.variance).

Note that contrary to the usual mathematical functions in Pine Script™,
those used on arrays do not return `na` when some of the values they
calculate on have `na` values. There are a few exceptions to this rule:

- When all array elements have `na` value or the array contains no
  elements, `na` is returned. `array.standardize()` however, will
  return an empty array.
- `array.mode()` will return `na` when no mode is found.

## [Manipulating arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#manipulating-arrays)

### [Concatenation](https://www.tradingview.com#concatenation)

Two arrays can be merged — or concatenated — using
[array.concat()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.concat).
When arrays are concatenated, the second array is appended to the end of
the first, so the first array is modified while the second one remains
intact. The function returns the array ID of the first array:

![image](images/Arrays-ManipulatingArrays-Concat.CQ5DQ3gZ_ZTX5jU.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`array.concat()`")
a = array.new<float>(0)
b = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
array.push(b, 2)
array.push(b, 3)
if barstate.islast
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "BEFORE\na: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nb: " + str.tostring(b), size = size.large)
    c = array.concat(a, b)
    array.push(c, 4)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "AFTER\na: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nb: " + str.tostring(b) + "\nc: " + str.tostring(c), style = label.style_label_up, size = size.large)
```

### [Copying](https://www.tradingview.com#copying)

You can copy an array using
[array.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.copy).
Here we copy the array `a` to a new array named `_b`:

![image](images/Arrays-ManipulatingArrays-Copy.CEsYR745_Z1XGnfX.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`array.copy()`")
a = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
if barstate.islast
    b = array.copy(a)
    array.push(b, 2)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "a: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nb: " + str.tostring(b), size = size.large)
```

Note that simply using `_b = a` in the previous example would not have
copied the array, but only its ID. From thereon, both variables would
point to the same array, so using either one would affect the same
array.

### [Joining](https://www.tradingview.com#joining)

Use
[array.join()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.join)
to concatenate all of the elements in the array into a string and
separate these elements with the specified separator:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
v1 = array.new<string>(10, "test")
v2 = array.new<string>(10, "test")
array.push(v2, "test1")
v3 = array.new_float(5, 5)
v4 = array.new_int(5, 5)
l1 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v1))
l2 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v2, ","))
l3 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v3, ","))
l4 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v4, ","))
```

### [Sorting](https://www.tradingview.com#sorting)

Arrays containing "int" or "float" elements can be sorted in either
ascending or descending order using
[array.sort()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.sort).
The `order` parameter is optional and defaults to
[order.ascending](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_order.ascending).
As all `array.*()` function arguments, it is qualified as "series", so
can be determined at runtime, as is done here. Note that in the example,
which array is sorted is also determined at runtime:

![image](images/Arrays-ManipulatingArrays-Sort.haUz9_aY_1pWobe.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`array.sort()`")
a = array.new<float>(0)
b = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(a, 2)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
array.push(b, 4)
array.push(b, 3)
array.push(b, 5)
if barstate.islast
    barUp = close > open
    array.sort(barUp ? a : b, barUp ? order.ascending : order.descending)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, 
      "a " + (barUp ? "is sorted ▲: "   : "is not sorted: ") + str.tostring(a) + "\n\n" +
      "b " + (barUp ? "is not sorted: " : "is sorted ▼: ")   + str.tostring(b), size = size.large)
```

Another useful option for sorting arrays is to use the
[array.sort_indices()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.sort_indices)
function, which takes a reference to the original array and returns an
array containing the indices from the original array. Please note that
this function won't modify the original array. The `order` parameter is
optional and defaults to
[order.ascending](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_order.ascending).

### [Reversing](https://www.tradingview.com#reversing)

Use
[array.reverse()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.reverse)
to reverse an array:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`array.reverse()`")
a = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
array.push(a, 2)
if barstate.islast
    array.reverse(a)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "a: " + str.tostring(a))
```

### [Slicing](https://www.tradingview.com#slicing)

Slicing an array using
[array.slice()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.slice)
creates a shallow copy of a subset of the parent array. You determine
the size of the subset to slice using the `index_from` and `index_to`
parameters. The `index_to` argument must be one greater than the end of
the subset you want to slice.

The shallow copy created by the slice acts like a window on the parent
array's content. The indices used for the slice define the window's
position and size over the parent array. If, as in the example below, a
slice is created from the first three elements of an array (indices 0 to
2), then regardless of changes made to the parent array, and as long as
it contains at least three elements, the shallow copy will always
contain the parent array's first three elements.

Additionally, once the shallow copy is created, operations on the copy
are mirrored on the parent array. Adding an element to the end of the
shallow copy, as is done in the following example, will widen the window
by one element and also insert that element in the parent array at index
3. In this example, to slice the subset from index 0 to index 2 of array
`a`, we must use `sliceOfA = array.slice(a, 0, 3)`:

![image](images/Arrays-ManipulatingArrays-Slice.DDHrRFqO_1X3bnc.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`array.slice()`")
a = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
array.push(a, 2)
array.push(a, 3)
if barstate.islast
    // Create a shadow of elements at index 1 and 2 from array `a`.
    sliceOfA = array.slice(a, 0, 3)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "BEFORE\na: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nsliceOfA: " + str.tostring(sliceOfA))
    // Remove first element of parent array `a`.
    array.remove(a, 0)
    // Add a new element at the end of the shallow copy, thus also affecting the original array `a`.
    array.push(sliceOfA, 4)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "AFTER\na: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nsliceOfA: " + str.tostring(sliceOfA), style = label.style_label_up)
```

## [Searching arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#searching-arrays)

We can test if a value is part of an array with the
[array.includes()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.includes)
function, which returns true if the element is found. We can find the
first occurrence of a value in an array by using the
[array.indexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.indexof)
function. The first occurence is the one with the lowest index. We can
also find the last occurrence of a value with
[array.lastindexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.lastindexof):

```
//@version=6
indicator("Searching in arrays")
valueInput = input.int(1)
a = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
array.push(a, 2)
array.push(a, 1)
if barstate.islast
    valueFound      = array.includes(a, valueInput)
    firstIndexFound = array.indexof(a, valueInput)
    lastIndexFound  = array.lastindexof(a, valueInput)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "a: " + str.tostring(a) + 
      "\nFirst " + str.tostring(valueInput) + (firstIndexFound != -1 ? " value was found at index: " + str.tostring(firstIndexFound) : " value was not found.") +
      "\nLast " + str.tostring(valueInput)  + (lastIndexFound  != -1 ? " value was found at index: " + str.tostring(lastIndexFound) : " value was not found."))
```

We can also perform a binary search on an array but note that performing
a binary search on an array means that the array will first need to be
sorted in ascending order only. The
[array.binary_search()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.binary_search)
function will return the value's index if it was found or -1 if it
wasn't. If we want to always return an existing index from the array
even if our chosen value wasn't found, then we can use one of the other
binary search functions available. The
[array.binary_search_leftmost()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.binary_search_leftmost)
function, which returns an index if the value was found or the first
index to the left where the value would be found. The
[array.binary_search_rightmost()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.binary_search_rightmost)
function is almost identical and returns an index if the value was found
or the first index to the right where the value would be found.

## [Error handling](https://www.tradingview.com#error-handling)

Malformed `array.*()` call syntax in Pine scripts will cause the usual
**compiler** error messages to appear in Pine Editor's console, at the
bottom of the window, when you save a script. Refer to the Pine Script™
[v6 Reference
Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/) when in
doubt regarding the exact syntax of function calls.

Scripts using arrays can also throw **runtime** errors, which appear as
an exclamation mark next to the indicator's name on the chart. We
discuss those runtime errors in this section.

### [Index xx is out of bounds. Array size is yy](https://www.tradingview.com#index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-array-size-is-yy)

This error is the most frequent one programmers encounter when using arrays. The error occurs when the script references a *nonexistent* array index. The "xx"
value represents the out-of-bounds index the function tried to use, and "yy" represents the array's size. Recall that array indices start at zero — not one — and end at the array's size, minus one. For instance, the last valid index in a three-element array is `2`.

To avoid this error, you must make provisions in your code logic to prevent using an index value outside the array's boundaries. This code example generates the error because the last `i` value in the loop's iterations is beyond the valid index range for the `a` array:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Out of bounds index")
a = array.new<float>(3)
for i = 1 to 3
    array.set(a, i, i)
plot(array.pop(a))
```

To resolve the error, last `i` value in the loop statement should be less than or equal to 2:

```
for i = 0 to 2
```

To iterate over all elements in an array of *unknown* size with a [for](#for-loops) loop, set the loop counter's final value to one less than the [array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Protected `for` loop")
sizeInput = input.int(0, "Array size", minval = 0, maxval = 100000)
a = array.new<float>(sizeInput)
for i = 0 to (array.size(a) == 0 ? na : array.size(a) - 1)
    array.set(a, i, i)
plot(array.pop(a))
```

When sizing arrays dynamically using a field in the script's
*Settings/Inputs* tab, protect the boundaries of that value using
[input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)'s
`minval` and `maxval` parameters:

```

### [Cannot call array methods when ID of array is 'na'](https://www.tradingview.com#cannot-call-array-methods-when-id-of-array-is-na)

When an array ID is initialized to `na`, operations on it are not
allowed, since no array exists. All that exists at that point is an
array variable containing the `na` value rather than a valid array ID
pointing to an existing array. Note that an array created with no
elements in it, as you do when you use `a = array.new_int(0)`, has a
valid ID nonetheless. This code will throw the error we are discussing:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Array methods on `na` array")
array<int> a = na
array.push(a, 111)
label.new(bar_index, 0, "a: " + str.tostring(a))
```

To avoid it, create an array with size zero using:

```
array<int> a = array.new_int(0)
```

or:

```
a = array.new_int(0)
```

### [Array is too large. Maximum size is 100000](https://www.tradingview.com#array-is-too-large-maximum-size-is-100000)

This error will appear if your code attempts to declare an array with a
size greater than 100,000. It will also occur if, while dynamically
appending elements to an array, a new element would increase the
array's size past the maximum.

### [Cannot create an array with a negative size](https://www.tradingview.com#cannot-create-an-array-with-a-negative-size)

We haven't found any use for arrays of negative size yet, but if you
ever do, we may allow them :)

### [Cannot use shift() if array is empty.](https://www.tradingview.com#cannot-use-shift-if-array-is-empty)

This error will occur if
[array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
is called to remove the first element of an empty array.

### [Cannot use pop() if array is empty.](https://www.tradingview.com#cannot-use-pop-if-array-is-empty)

This error will occur if
[array.pop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.pop)
is called to remove the last element of an empty array.

### [Index 'from' should be less than index 'to'](https://www.tradingview.com#index-from-should-be-less-than-index-to)

When two indices are used in functions such as
[array.slice()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.slice),
the first index must always be smaller than the second one.

### [Slice is out of bounds of the parent array](https://www.tradingview.com#slice-is-out-of-bounds-of-the-parent-array)

This message occurs whenever the parent array's size is modified in
such a way that it makes the shallow copy created by a slice point
outside the boundaries of the parent array. This code will reproduce it
because after creating a slice from index 3 to 4 (the last two elements
of our five-element parent array), we remove the parent's first
element, making its size four and its last index 3. From that moment on,
the shallow copy which is still pointing to the "window" at the parent
array's indices 3 to 4, is pointing out of the parent array's
boundaries:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Slice out of bounds")
a = array.new<float>(5, 0)
b = array.slice(a, 3, 5)
array.remove(a, 0)
c = array.indexof(b, 2)
plot(c)
```

# [Matrices](https://www.tradingview.com#matrices)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ Matrices are [collections](#collections) that store value references in a
rectangular format. They are the equivalent of two-dimensional [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) objects with functions and methods for inspection, modification, and specialized calculations. As with [arrays](#arrays), all matrix elements must be of the same [type](#types), [user-defined type](#user-defined-types), or [enum type](#enum-types).

Matrices reference their elements using *two* indices: one index for their
*rows* and the other for their *columns*. Each index starts at 0 and extends
to the number of rows/columns in the matrix minus one. Matrices in Pine
can have dynamic numbers of rows and columns that vary across bars. The
[total number of
elements](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.elements_count)
within a matrix is the *product* of the number of
[rows](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows)
and
[columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.columns)
(e.g., a 5x5 matrix has a total of 25). Like
[arrays](#arrays), the total number of
elements in a matrix cannot exceed 100,000.

## [Declaring a matrix](https://www.tradingview.com#declaring-a-matrix)

Pine Script™ uses the following syntax for matrix declaration:

```
[var/varip ][matrix<type> ]<identifier> = <expression>
```

Where `<type>` is a
[type template](#type-templates) for the matrix that declares the type of values it will
contain, and the `<expression>` returns either a matrix instance of the
type or `na`.

When declaring a matrix variable as `na`, users must specify that the
identifier will reference matrices of a specific type by including the
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix)
keyword followed by a
[type template](#type-templates).

This line declares a new `myMatrix` variable with a value of `na`. It
explicitly declares the variable as `matrix<float>`, which tells the
compiler that the variable can only accept
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix)
objects containing
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
values:

```
matrix<float> myMatrix = na
```

When a matrix variable is not assigned to `na`, the
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix)
keyword and its type template are optional, as the compiler will use the
type information from the object the variable references.

Here, we declare a `myMatrix` variable referencing a new `matrix<float>`
instance with two rows, two columns, and an `initial_value` of 0. The
variable gets its type information from the new object in this case, so
it doesn't require an explicit type declaration:

```
myMatrix = matrix.new<float>(2, 2, 0.0)
```

### [Using `var` and `varip` keywords](https://www.tradingview.com#using-var-and-varip-keywords)

As with other variables, users can include the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keywords to instruct a script to declare a matrix variable only once
rather than on every bar. A matrix variable declared with this keyword
will point to the same instance throughout the span of the chart unless
the script explicitly assigns another matrix to it, allowing a matrix
and its element references to persist between script iterations.

This script declares an `m` variable assigned to a matrix that holds a
single row of two
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
elements using the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword. On every 20th bar, the script adds 1 to the first element on
the first row of the `m` matrix. The
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
call displays this element on the chart. As we see from the plot, the
value of [m.get(0,
0)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.get)
persists between bars, never returning to the initial value of 0:

![image](images/Matrices-Declaring-a-matrix-Using-var-and-varip-keywords-1.DaUqe-zB_10ShDW.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("var matrix demo")

//@variable A 1x2 rectangular matrix declared only at `bar_index == 0`, i.e., the first bar.
var m = matrix.new<int>(1, 2, 0)

//@variable Is `true` on every 20th bar.
bool update = bar_index % 20 == 0

if update
    int currentValue = m.get(0, 0) // Get the current value of the first row and column.
    m.set(0, 0, currentValue + 1)  // Set the first row and column element value to `currentValue + 1`.

plot(m.get(0, 0), linewidth = 3) // Plot the value from the first row and column.
```

## [Reading and writing matrix elements](https://www.tradingview.com#reading-and-writing-matrix-elements)

### [`matrix.get()` and `matrix.set()`](https://www.tradingview.com#matrixget-and-matrixset)

To retrieve the value from a matrix at a specified `row` and `column`
index, use
[matrix.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.get).
This function locates the specified matrix element and returns its
value. Similarly, to overwrite a specific element's value, use
[matrix.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.set)
to assign the element at the specified `row` and `column` to a new
`value`.

The example below defines a square matrix `m` with two rows and columns
and an `initial_value` of 0 for all elements on the first bar. The
script adds 1 to each element's value on different bars using the
[m.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.get)
and
[m.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.set)
methods. It updates the first row's first value once every 11 bars, the
first row's second value once every seven bars, the second row's first
value once every five bars, and the second row's second value once
every three bars. The script plots each element's value on the chart:

![image](images/Matrices-Reading-and-writing-matrix-elements-1.Cpd5xwu1_Z2j5Ymv.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reading and writing elements demo")

//@variable A 2x2 square matrix of `float` values.
var m = matrix.new<float>(2, 2, 0.0)

switch
    bar_index % 11 == 0 => m.set(0, 0, m.get(0, 0) + 1.0) // Adds 1 to the value at row 0, column 0 every 11th bar.
    bar_index % 7  == 0 => m.set(0, 1, m.get(0, 1) + 1.0) // Adds 1 to the value at row 0, column 1 every 7th bar.
    bar_index % 5  == 0 => m.set(1, 0, m.get(1, 0) + 1.0) // Adds 1 to the value at row 1, column 0 every 5th bar.
    bar_index % 3  == 0 => m.set(1, 1, m.get(1, 1) + 1.0) // Adds 1 to the value at row 1, column 1 every 3rd bar.

plot(m.get(0, 0), "Row 0, Column 0 Value", color.red, 2)
plot(m.get(0, 1), "Row 0, Column 1 Value", color.orange, 2)
plot(m.get(1, 0), "Row 1, Column 0 Value", color.green, 2)
plot(m.get(1, 1), "Row 1, Column 1 Value", color.blue, 2)
```

### [`matrix.fill()`](https://www.tradingview.com#matrixfill)

To overwrite all matrix elements with a specific value, use
[matrix.fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.fill).
This function points all items in the entire matrix or within the
`from_row/column` and `to_row/column` index range to the `value`
specified in the call. For example, this snippet declares a 4x4 square
matrix, then fills its elements with a
[random](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random)
value:

```
myMatrix = matrix.new<float>(4, 4)
myMatrix.fill(math.random())
```

Note when using
[matrix.fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.fill)
with matrices containing special types
([line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table),
or
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point))
or [UDTs](#user-defined-types), all replaced elements will point to the same object passed
in the function call.

This script declares a matrix with four rows and columns of
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
references, which it fills with a new
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
object on the first bar. On each bar, the script sets the `x` attribute
of the label referenced at row 0, column 0 to
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index),
and the `text` attribute of the one referenced at row 3, column 3 to the
number of labels on the chart. Although the matrix can reference 16
(4x4) labels, each element points to the *same* instance, resulting in
only one label on the chart that updates its `x` and `text` attributes
on each bar:

![image](images/Matrices-Reading-and-writing-matrix-elements-2.EKhiO87r_27PkSE.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Object matrix fill demo")

//@variable A 4x4 label matrix.
var matrix<label> m = matrix.new<label>(4, 4)

// Fill `m` with a new label object on the first bar.
if bar_index == 0
    m.fill(label.new(0, 0, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge))

//@variable The number of label objects on the chart.
int numLabels = label.all.size()

// Set the `x` of the label from the first row and column to `bar_index`.
m.get(0, 0).set_x(bar_index)
// Set the `text` of the label at the last row and column to the number of labels.
m.get(3, 3).set_text(str.format("Total labels on the chart: {0}", numLabels))
```

## [Rows and columns](https://www.tradingview.com#rows-and-columns)

### [Retrieving](https://www.tradingview.com#retrieving)

Matrices facilitate the retrieval of all values from a specific row or
column via the
[matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row)
and
[matrix.col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.col)
functions. These functions return the values as an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
object sized according to the other dimension of the matrix, i.e., the
size of a
[matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row)
array equals the [number of
columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.columns)
and the size of a
[matrix.col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.col)
array equals the [number of
rows](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows).

The script below populates a 3x2 `m` matrix with the values 1 - 6 on the
first chart bar. It calls the
[m.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row)
and
[m.col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.col)
methods to access the first row and column arrays from the matrix and
displays them on the chart in a label along with the array sizes:

![image](images/Matrices-Rows-and-columns-Retrieving-1.BTrlXXxp_Zjj8GI.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Retrieving rows and columns demo")

//@variable A 3x2 rectangular matrix.
var matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>(3, 2)

if bar_index == 0
    m.set(0, 0, 1.0) // Set row 0, column 0 value to 1.
    m.set(0, 1, 2.0) // Set row 0, column 1 value to 2.
    m.set(1, 0, 3.0) // Set row 1, column 0 value to 3.
    m.set(1, 1, 4.0) // Set row 1, column 1 value to 4.
    m.set(2, 0, 5.0) // Set row 2, column 0 value to 5.
    m.set(2, 1, 6.0) // Set row 2, column 1 value to 6.

//@variable The first row of the matrix.
array<float> row0 = m.row(0)
//@variable The first column of the matrix.
array<float> column0 = m.col(0)

//@variable Displays the first row and column of the matrix and their sizes in a label.
var label debugLabel = label.new(0, 0, color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge)
debugLabel.set_x(bar_index)
debugLabel.set_text(str.format("Row 0: {0}, Size: {1}\nCol 0: {2}, Size: {3}", row0, m.columns(), column0, m.rows()))
```

Note that:

- To get the sizes of the arrays displayed in the label, we used
  the
  [rows()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows)
  and
  [columns()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.columns)
  methods rather than
  [array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
  to demonstrate that the size of the `row0` array equals the
  number of columns and the size of the `column0` array equals the
  number of rows.

[matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row)
and
[matrix.col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.col)
copy the references in a row/column to a new
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).
Modifications to the [arrays](#arrays)
returned by these functions do not directly affect the elements or the
shape of a matrix.

Here, we've modified the previous script to set the first element of
`row0` to 10 via the
[array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set)
method before displaying the label. This script also plots the value
from row 0, column 0. As we see, the label shows that the first element
of the `row0` array is 10. However, the
[plot](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
shows that the corresponding matrix element still has a value of 1:

![image](images/Matrices-Rows-and-columns-Retrieving-2.CJgBcT5Y_1sKqb7.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Retrieving rows and columns demo")

//@variable A 3x2 rectangular matrix.
var matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>(3, 2)

if bar_index == 0
    m.set(0, 0, 1.0) // Set row 0, column 0 value to 1.
    m.set(0, 1, 2.0) // Set row 0, column 1 value to 2.
    m.set(1, 0, 3.0) // Set row 1, column 0 value to 3.
    m.set(1, 1, 4.0) // Set row 1, column 1 value to 4.
    m.set(2, 0, 5.0) // Set row 1, column 0 value to 5.
    m.set(2, 1, 6.0) // Set row 1, column 1 value to 6.

//@variable The first row of the matrix.
array<float> row0 = m.row(0)
//@variable The first column of the matrix.
array<float> column0 = m.col(0)

// Set the first `row` element to 10.
row0.set(0, 10)

//@variable Displays the first row and column of the matrix and their sizes in a label.
var label debugLabel = label.new(0, m.get(0, 0), color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge)
debugLabel.set_x(bar_index)
debugLabel.set_text(str.format("Row 0: {0}, Size: {1}\nCol 0: {2}, Size: {3}", row0, m.columns(), column0, m.rows()))

// Plot the first element of `m`.
plot(m.get(0, 0), linewidth = 3)
```

Although changes to an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
returned by
[matrix.row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.row)
or
[matrix.col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.col)
do not directly affect a parent matrix, it's important to note the
resulting array from a matrix containing
[UDTs](#user-defined-types)
or special types, including
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table),
or
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point),
behaves as a *shallow copy* of a row/column, i.e., the elements within
an array returned from these functions point to the same objects as the
corresponding matrix elements.

This script contains a custom `myUDT` type containing a `value` field
with an initial value of 0. It declares a 1x1 `m` matrix to hold a
single `myUDT` instance on the first bar, then calls `m.row(0)` to copy
the first row of the matrix as an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).
On every chart bar, the script adds 1 to the `value` field of the first
`row` array element. In this case, the `value` field of the matrix
element increases on every bar as well since both elements reference the
same object:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Row with reference types demo")

//@type A custom type that holds a float value.
type myUDT
    float value = 0.0

//@variable A 1x1 matrix of `myUDT` type.
var matrix<myUDT> m = matrix.new<myUDT>(1, 1, myUDT.new())
//@variable A shallow copy of the first row of `m`.
array<myUDT> row = m.row(0)
//@variable The first element of the `row`.
myUDT firstElement = row.get(0)

firstElement.value += 1.0 // Add 1 to the `value` field of `firstElement`. Also affects the element in the matrix.

plot(m.get(0, 0).value, linewidth = 3) // Plot the `value` of the `myUDT` object from the first row and column of `m`.
```

### [Inserting](https://www.tradingview.com#inserting)

Scripts can add new rows and columns to a matrix via
[matrix.add_row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_row)
and
[matrix.add_col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_col).
These functions insert the value references from an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
into a matrix at the specified `row/column` index. If the `id` matrix is
empty (has no rows or columns), the `array_id` in the call can be of any
size. If a row/column exists at the specified index, the matrix
increases the index value for the existing row/column and all after it
by 1.

The script below declares an empty `m` matrix and inserts rows and
columns using the
[m.add_row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_row)
and
[m.add_col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_col)
methods. It first inserts an array with three elements at row 0, turning
`m` into a 1x3 matrix, then another at row 1, changing the shape to 2x3.
After that, the script inserts another array at row 0, which changes the
shape of `m` to 3x3 and shifts the index of all rows previously at index
0 and higher. It inserts another array at the last column index,
changing the shape to 3x4. Finally, it adds an array with four values at
the end row index.

The resulting matrix has four rows and columns and contains values 1-16
in ascending order. The script displays the rows of `m` after each
row/column insertion with a user-defined `debugLabel()` function to
visualize the process:

![image](images/Matrices-Rows-and-columns-Inserting-1.SBCXGGVm_ZyieEL.png)

```
//@version=6

//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//Create an empty matrix.
var m = matrix.new<float>()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    debugLabel(m, bar_index - 30, note = "Empty matrix")

    // Insert an array at row 0. `m` will now have 1 row and 3 columns.
    m.add_row(0, array.from(5, 6, 7))
    debugLabel(m, bar_index - 20, note = "New row at\nindex 0")

    // Insert an array at row 1. `m` will now have 2 rows and 3 columns.
    m.add_row(1, array.from(9, 10, 11))
    debugLabel(m, bar_index - 10, note = "New row at\nindex 1")

    // Insert another array at row 0. `m` will now have 3 rows and 3 columns.
    // The values previously on row 0 will now be on row 1, and the values from row 1 will be on row 2.
    m.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3))
    debugLabel(m, bar_index, note = "New row at\nindex 0")

    // Insert an array at column 3. `m` will now have 3 rows and 4 columns.
    m.add_col(3, array.from(4, 8, 12))
    debugLabel(m, bar_index + 10, note = "New column at\nindex 3")

    // Insert an array at row 3. `m` will now have 4 rows and 4 columns.
    m.add_row(3, array.from(13, 14, 15, 16))
    debugLabel(m, bar_index + 20, note = "New row at\nindex 3")
```

### [Removing](https://www.tradingview.com#removing)

To remove a specific row or column from a matrix, use
[matrix.remove_row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.remove_row)
and
[matrix.remove_col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.remove_col).
These functions remove the specified row/column and decrease the index
values of all rows/columns after it by 1.

For this example, we've added these lines of code to our "Rows and
columns demo" script from the
[section above](#inserting):

```
// Removing example

    // Remove the first row and last column from the matrix. `m` will now have 3 rows and 3 columns.
    m.remove_row(0)
    m.remove_col(3)
    debugLabel(m, bar_index + 30, color.red, note = "Removed row 0\nand column 3")
```

This code removes the first row and the last column of the `m` matrix
using the
[m.remove_row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.remove_row)
and
[m.remove_col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.remove_col)
methods and displays the rows in a label at `bar_index + 30`. As we can
see, `m` has a 3x3 shape after executing this block, and the index
values for all existing rows are reduced by 1:

![image](images/Matrices-Rows-and-columns-Removing-1.Bi1zJWmd_ZpgTSa.png)

### [Swapping](https://www.tradingview.com#swapping)

To swap the rows and columns of a matrix without altering its
dimensions, use
[matrix.swap_rows()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.swap_rows)
and
[matrix.swap_columns()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.swap_columns).
These functions swap the locations of the elements at the `row1/column1`
and `row2/column2` indices.

Let's add the following lines to the
[previous example](#removing), which swap the first and last rows of `m` and display the
changes in a label at `bar_index + 40`:

```
// Swapping example

    // Swap the first and last row. `m` retains the same dimensions.
    m.swap_rows(0, 2)
    debugLabel(m, bar_index + 40, color.purple, note = "Swapped rows 0\nand 2")
```

In the new label, we see the matrix has the same number of rows as
before, and the first and last rows have traded places:

![image](images/Matrices-Rows-and-columns-Swapping-1.CEKWu0X8_ZXVDWE.png)

### [Replacing](https://www.tradingview.com#replacing)

It may be desirable in some cases to completely *replace* a row or
column in a matrix. To do so,
[insert](#inserting) the new array at the desired `row/column` and
[remove](#removing) the old elements previously at that index.

In the following code, we've defined a `replaceRow()` method that uses
the
[add_row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_row)
method to insert the new `values` at the `row` index and uses the
[remove_row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.remove_row)
method to remove the old row that moved to the `row + 1` index. This
script uses the `replaceRow()` method to fill the rows of a 3x3 matrix
with the numbers 1-9. It draws a label on the chart before and after
replacing the rows using the custom `debugLabel()` method:

![image](images/Matrices-Rows-and-columns-Replacing-1.DOIpvAMN_ZBuSGC.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Replacing rows demo")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@function Replaces the `row` of `this` matrix with a new array of `values`.
//@param    row The row index to replace.
//@param    values The array of values to insert.
method replaceRow(matrix<float> this, int row, array<float> values) =>
    this.add_row(row, values) // Inserts a copy of the `values` array at the `row`.
    this.remove_row(row + 1)  // Removes the old elements previously at the `row`.

//@variable A 3x3 matrix.
var matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>(3, 3, 0.0)

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    m.debugLabel(note = "Original")
    // Replace each row of `m`.
    m.replaceRow(0, array.from(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
    m.replaceRow(1, array.from(4.0, 5.0, 6.0))
    m.replaceRow(2, array.from(7.0, 8.0, 9.0))
    m.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, note = "Replaced rows")
```

## [Looping through a matrix](https://www.tradingview.com#looping-through-a-matrix)

### [`for`](https://www.tradingview.com#for)

When a script only needs to iterate over the row/column indices in a
matrix, the most common method is to use
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)
loops. For example, this line creates a loop with a `row` value that
starts at 0 and increases by one until it reaches one less than the
number of rows in the `m` matrix (i.e., the last row index):

```
for row = 0 to m.rows() - 1
```

To iterate over all index values in the `m` matrix, we can create a
*nested* loop that iterates over each `column` index on each `row`
value:

```
for row = 0 to m.rows() - 1
    for column = 0 to m.columns() - 1
```

Let's use this nested structure to create a
[method](#methods) that visualizes
matrix elements. In the script below, we've defined a `toTable()`
method that displays the elements of a matrix within a
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
object. It iterates over each `row` index and over each `column` index
on every `row`. Within the loop, it converts each element to a
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
to display in the corresponding table cell.

On the first bar, the script creates an empty `m` matrix, populates it
with rows, and calls `m.toTable()` to display its elements:

![image](images/Matrices-Looping-through-a-matrix-For-1.AD9eoMUJ_ZEOwGG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("for loop demo", "Matrix to table")

//@function Displays the elements of `this` matrix in a table.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    position The position of the table on the chart.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the table.
//@param    textColor The color of the text in each cell.
//@param    note A note string to display on the bottom row of the table.
//@returns  A new `table` object with cells corresponding to each element of `this` matrix.
method toTable(
     matrix<float> this, string position = position.middle_center,
     color bgColor = color.blue, color textColor = color.white,
     string note = na
 ) =>
    //@variable The number of rows in `this` matrix.
    int rows = this.rows()
    //@variable The number of columns in `this` matrix.
    int columns = this.columns()
    //@variable A table that displays the elements of `this` matrix with an optional `note` cell.
    table result = table.new(position, columns, rows + 1, bgColor)

    // Iterate over each row index of `this` matrix.
    for row = 0 to rows - 1
        // Iterate over each column index of `this` matrix on each `row`.
        for col = 0 to columns - 1
            //@variable The element from `this` matrix at the `row` and `col` index.
            float element = this.get(row, col)
            // Initialize the corresponding `result` cell with the `element` value.
            result.cell(col, row, str.tostring(element), text_color = textColor, text_size = size.huge)

    // Initialize a merged cell on the bottom row if a `note` is provided.
    if not na(note)
        result.cell(0, rows, note, text_color = textColor, text_size = size.huge)
        result.merge_cells(0, rows, columns - 1, rows)

    result // Return the `result` table.

//@variable A 3x4 matrix of values.
var m = matrix.new<float>()

if bar_index == 0
    // Add rows to `m`.
    m.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3))
    m.add_row(1, array.from(5, 6, 7))
    m.add_row(2, array.from(9, 10, 11))
    // Add a column to `m`.
    m.add_col(3, array.from(4, 8, 12))
    // Display the elements of `m` in a table.
    m.toTable()
```

### [`for…in`](https://www.tradingview.com#forin)

When a script needs to iterate over and retrieve the rows of a matrix,
using the
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_for%7Bdot%7D%7Bdot%7D%7Bdot%7Din)
structure is often preferred over the standard `for` loop. This
structure directly references the row
[arrays](#arrays) in a matrix, making
it a more convenient option for such use cases. For example, this line
creates a loop that returns a `row` array for each row in the `m`
matrix:

```
for row in m
```

The following indicator calculates the moving average of OHLC data with
an input `length` and displays the values on the chart. The custom
`rowWiseAvg()` method loops through the rows of a matrix using a
`for...in` structure to produce an array containing the
[array.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg)
of each `row`.

On the first chart bar, the script creates a new `m` matrix with four
rows and `length` columns, which it queues a new column of OHLC data
into via the
[m.add_col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_col)
and
[m.remove_col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.remove_col)
methods on each subsequent bar. It uses `m.rowWiseAvg()` to calculate
the array of row-wise `averages`, then it plots the element values on
the chart:

![image](images/Matrices-Looping-through-a-matrix-For-in-1.DsFiIU_K_Z1Fdgid.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("for...in loop demo", "Average OHLC", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of terms in the average.
int length = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 1)

//@function Calculates the average of each matrix row.
method rowWiseAvg(matrix<float> this) =>
    //@variable An array with elements corresponding to each row's average.
    array<float> result = array.new<float>()
    // Iterate over each `row` of `this` matrix.
    for row in this
        // Push the average of each `row` into the `result`.
        result.push(row.avg())
    result // Return the resulting array.

//@variable A 4x`length` matrix of values.
var matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>(4, length)

// Add a new column containing OHLC values to the matrix.
m.add_col(m.columns(), array.from(open, high, low, close))
// Remove the first column.
m.remove_col(0)

//@variable An array containing averages of `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` over `length` bars.
array<float> averages = m.rowWiseAvg()

plot(averages.get(0), "Average Open",  color.blue,   2)
plot(averages.get(1), "Average High",  color.green,  2)
plot(averages.get(2), "Average Low",   color.red,    2)
plot(averages.get(3), "Average Close", color.orange, 2)
```

Note that:

- `for...in` loops can also reference the index value of each row.
  For example, `for [i, row] in m` creates a tuple containing the
  `i` row index and the corresponding `row` array from the `m`
  matrix on each loop iteration.

## [Copying a matrix](https://www.tradingview.com#copying-a-matrix)

### [Shallow copies](https://www.tradingview.com#shallow-copies)

Pine scripts can copy matrices via
[matrix.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.copy).
This function returns a *shallow copy* of a matrix that does not affect
the shape of the original matrix or its references.

For example, this script assigns a new matrix to the `myMatrix` variable
and adds two columns. It creates a new `myCopy` matrix from `myMatrix`
using the
[myMatrix.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.copy)
method, then adds a new row. It displays the rows of both matrices in
labels via the user-defined `debugLabel()` function:

![image](images/Matrices-Copying-a-matrix-Shallow-copies-1.Bwmv7fvt_Z2gUKoY.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Shallow copy demo")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 2x2 `float` matrix.
matrix<float> myMatrix = matrix.new<float>()
myMatrix.add_col(0, array.from(1.0, 3.0))
myMatrix.add_col(1, array.from(2.0, 4.0))

//@variable A shallow copy of `myMatrix`.
matrix<float> myCopy = myMatrix.copy()
// Add a row to the last index of `myCopy`.
myCopy.add_row(myCopy.rows(), array.from(5.0, 6.0))

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Display the rows of both matrices in separate labels.
    myMatrix.debugLabel(note = "Original")
    myCopy.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, color.green, note = "Shallow Copy")
```

It's important to note that the elements within shallow copies of a
matrix point to the same values as the original matrix. When matrices
contain special types
([line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table),
or
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point))
or
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types), the elements of a shallow copy reference the same objects
as the original.

This script declares a `myMatrix` variable with a `newLabel` as the
initial value. It then copies `myMatrix` to a `myCopy` variable via
[myMatrix.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.copy)
and plots the number of labels. As we see below, there's only one
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
on the chart, as the element in `myCopy` references the same object as
the element in `myMatrix`. Consequently, changes to the element values
in `myCopy` affect the values in both matrices:

![image](images/Matrices-Copying-a-matrix-Shallow-copies-2.CimkBVuC_XKEfb.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Shallow copy demo")

//@variable Initial value of the original matrix elements.
var label newLabel = label.new(
     bar_index, 1, "Original", color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
 )

//@variable A 1x1 matrix containing a new `label` instance.
var matrix<label> myMatrix = matrix.new<label>(1, 1, newLabel)
//@variable A shallow copy of `myMatrix`.
var matrix<label> myCopy = myMatrix.copy()

//@variable The first label from the `myCopy` matrix.
label testLabel = myCopy.get(0, 0)

// Change the `text`, `style`, and `x` values of `testLabel`. Also affects the `newLabel`.
testLabel.set_text("Copy")
testLabel.set_style(label.style_label_up)
testLabel.set_x(bar_index)

// Plot the total number of labels.
plot(label.all.size(), linewidth = 3)
```

### [Deep copies](https://www.tradingview.com#deep-copies)

One can produce a *deep copy* of a matrix (i.e., a matrix whose elements
point to copies of the original values) by explicitly copying each
object the matrix references.

Here, we've added a `deepCopy()` user-defined method to our previous
script. The method creates a new matrix and uses
[nested for loops](#for) to assign all elements to copies of the originals. When the
script calls this method instead of the built-in
[copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.copy),
we see that there are now two labels on the chart, and any changes to
the label from `myCopy` do not affect the one from `myMatrix`:

![image](images/Matrices-Copying-a-matrix-Deep-copies-1.DxEfU-j0_1Lkpmy.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Deep copy demo")

//@function Returns a deep copy of a label matrix.
method deepCopy(matrix<label> this) =>
    //@variable A deep copy of `this` matrix.
    matrix<label> that = this.copy()
    for row = 0 to that.rows() - 1
        for column = 0 to that.columns() - 1
            // Assign the element at each `row` and `column` of `that` matrix to a copy of the retrieved label.
            that.set(row, column, that.get(row, column).copy())
    that

//@variable Initial value of the original matrix.
var label newLabel = label.new(
     bar_index, 2, "Original", color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
 )

//@variable A 1x1 matrix containing a new `label` instance.
var matrix<label> myMatrix = matrix.new<label>(1, 1, newLabel)
//@variable A deep copy of `myMatrix`.
var matrix<label> myCopy = myMatrix.deepCopy()

//@variable The first label from the `myCopy` matrix.
label testLabel = myCopy.get(0, 0)

// Change the `text`, `style`, and `x` values of `testLabel`. Does not affect the `newLabel`.
testLabel.set_text("Copy")
testLabel.set_style(label.style_label_up)
testLabel.set_x(bar_index)

// Change the `x` value of `newLabel`.
newLabel.set_x(bar_index)

// Plot the total number of labels.
plot(label.all.size(), linewidth = 3)
```

### [Submatrices](https://www.tradingview.com#submatrices)

In Pine, a *submatrix* is a
[shallow copy](#shallow-copies) of an existing matrix that only includes the rows and
columns specified by the `from_row/column` and `to_row/column`
parameters. In essence, it is a sliced copy of a matrix.

For example, the script below creates an `mSub` matrix from the `m`
matrix via the
[m.submatrix()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.submatrix)
method, then calls our user-defined `debugLabel()` function to display
the rows of both matrices in labels:

![image](images/Matrices-Copying-a-matrix-Submatrices-1.BTbnoi2I_Z7HBh.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Submatrix demo")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 3x3 matrix of values.
var m = matrix.new<float>()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Add columns to `m`.
    m.add_col(0, array.from(9, 6, 3))
    m.add_col(1, array.from(8, 5, 2))
    m.add_col(2, array.from(7, 4, 1))
    // Display the rows of `m`.
    m.debugLabel(note = "Original Matrix")

    //@variable A 2x2 submatrix of `m` containing the first two rows and columns.
    matrix<float> mSub = m.submatrix(from_row = 0, to_row = 2, from_column = 0, to_column = 2)
    // Display the rows of `mSub`
    debugLabel(mSub, bar_index + 10, bgColor = color.green, note = "Submatrix")
```

## [Scope and history](https://www.tradingview.com#scope-and-history)

Matrix variables leave historical trails on each bar, allowing scripts
to use the history-referencing operator
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
to interact with past matrix instances previously assigned to a
variable. Additionally, scripts can modify matrices assigned to global
variables from within the scopes of
[functions](#user-defined-functions),
[methods](#methods), and
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures).

This script calculates the average ratios of body and wick distances
relative to the bar range over `length` bars. It displays the data along
with values from `length` bars ago in a table. The user-defined
`addData()` function adds columns of current and historical ratios to
the `globalMatrix`, and the `calcAvg()` function references `previous`
matrices assigned to `globalMatrix` using the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
operator to calculate a matrix of averages:

![image](images/Matrices-Scope-and-history-1.iA9FQFRn_Z1tlC9r.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Scope and history demo", "Bar ratio comparison")

int length = input.int(10, "Length", 1)

//@variable A global matrix.
matrix<float> globalMatrix = matrix.new<float>()

//@function Calculates the ratio of body range to candle range.
bodyRatio() =>
    math.abs(close - open) / (high - low)

//@function Calculates the ratio of upper wick range to candle range.
upperWickRatio() =>
    (high - math.max(open, close)) / (high - low)

//@function Calculates the ratio of lower wick range to candle range.
lowerWickRatio() =>
    (math.min(open, close) - low) / (high - low)

//@function Adds data to the `globalMatrix`.
addData() =>
    // Add a new column of data at `column` 0.
    globalMatrix.add_col(0, array.from(bodyRatio(), upperWickRatio(), lowerWickRatio()))
    //@variable The column of `globalMatrix` from index 0 `length` bars ago.
    array<float> pastValues = globalMatrix.col(0)[length]
    // Add `pastValues` to the `globalMatrix`, or an array of `na` if `pastValues` is `na`.
    if na(pastValues)
        globalMatrix.add_col(1, array.new<float>(3))
    else
        globalMatrix.add_col(1, pastValues)

//@function Returns the `length`-bar average of matrices assigned to `globalMatrix` on historical bars.
calcAvg() =>
    //@variable The sum historical `globalMatrix` matrices.
    matrix<float> sums = matrix.new<float>(globalMatrix.rows(), globalMatrix.columns(), 0.0)
    for i = 0 to length - 1
        //@variable The `globalMatrix` matrix `i` bars before the current bar.
        matrix<float> previous = globalMatrix[i]
        // Break the loop if `previous` is `na`.
        if na(previous)
            sums.fill(na)
            break
        // Assign the sum of `sums` and `previous` to `sums`.
        sums := matrix.sum(sums, previous)
    // Divide the `sums` matrix by the `length`.
    result = sums.mult(1.0 / length)

// Add data to the `globalMatrix`.
addData()

//@variable The historical average of the `globalMatrix` matrices.
globalAvg = calcAvg()

//@variable A `table` displaying information from the `globalMatrix`.
var table infoTable = table.new(
     position.middle_center, globalMatrix.columns() + 1, globalMatrix.rows() + 1, bgcolor = color.navy
 )

// Define value cells.
for [i, row] in globalAvg
    for [j, value] in row
        color textColor = value > 0.333 ? color.orange : color.gray
        infoTable.cell(j + 1, i + 1, str.tostring(value), text_color = textColor, text_size = size.huge)

// Define header cells.
infoTable.cell(0, 1, "Body ratio", text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge)
infoTable.cell(0, 2, "Upper wick ratio", text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge)
infoTable.cell(0, 3, "Lower wick ratio", text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge)
infoTable.cell(1, 0, "Current average", text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge)
infoTable.cell(2, 0, str.format("{0} bars ago", length), text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge)
```

Note that:

- The `addData()` and `calcAvg()` functions have no parameters, as
  they directly interact with the `globalMatrix` and `length`
  variables declared in the outer scope.
- `calcAvg()` calculates the average by adding `previous` matrices
  using
  [matrix.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.sum)
  and multiplying all elements by `1 / length` using
  [matrix.mult()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.mult).
  We discuss these and other specialized functions in our
  [Matrix calculations](#matrix-calculations) section below.

## [Inspecting a matrix](https://www.tradingview.com#inspecting-a-matrix)

The ability to inspect the shape of a matrix and patterns within its
elements is crucial, as it helps reveal important information about a
matrix and its compatibility with various calculations and
transformations. Pine Script™ includes several built-ins for matrix
inspection, including
[matrix.is_square()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_square),
[matrix.is_identity()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_identity),
[matrix.is_diagonal()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_diagonal),
[matrix.is_antidiagonal()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_antidiagonal),
[matrix.is_symmetric()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_symmetric),
[matrix.is_antisymmetric()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_antisymmetric),
[matrix.is_triangular()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_triangular),
[matrix.is_stochastic()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_stochastic),
[matrix.is_binary()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_binary),
and
[matrix.is_zero()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_zero).

To demonstrate these features, this example contains a custom
`inspect()` method that uses conditional blocks with `matrix.is_*()`
functions to return information about a matrix. It displays a string
representation of an `m` matrix and the description returned from
`m.inspect()` in labels on the chart:

![image](images/Matrices-Inspecting-a-matrix-1.CnldBvch_25YXn4.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Matrix inspection demo")

//@function Inspects a matrix using `matrix.is_*()` functions and returns a `string` describing some of its features.
method inspect(matrix<int> this)=>
    //@variable A string describing `this` matrix.
    string result = "This matrix:\n"
    if this.is_square()
        result += "- Has an equal number of rows and columns.\n"
    if this.is_binary()
        result += "- Contains only 1s and 0s.\n"
    if this.is_zero()
        result += "- Is filled with 0s.\n"
    if this.is_triangular()
        result += "- Contains only 0s above and/or below its main diagonal.\n"
    if this.is_diagonal()
        result += "- Only has nonzero values in its main diagonal.\n"
    if this.is_antidiagonal()
        result += "- Only has nonzero values in its main antidiagonal.\n"
    if this.is_symmetric()
        result += "- Equals its transpose.\n"
    if this.is_antisymmetric()
        result += "- Equals the negative of its transpose.\n"
    if this.is_identity()
        result += "- Is the identity matrix.\n"
    result

//@variable A 4x4 identity matrix.
matrix<int> m = matrix.new<int>()

// Add rows to the matrix.
m.add_row(0, array.from(1, 0, 0, 0))
m.add_row(1, array.from(0, 1, 0, 0))
m.add_row(2, array.from(0, 0, 1, 0))
m.add_row(3, array.from(0, 0, 0, 1))

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Display the `m` matrix in a blue label.
    label.new(
         bar_index, 0, str.tostring(m), color = color.blue, style = label.style_label_right,
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
     )
    // Display the result of `m.inspect()` in a purple label.
    label.new(
         bar_index, 0, m.inspect(), color = color.purple, style = label.style_label_left,
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
     )
```

## [Manipulating a matrix](https://www.tradingview.com#manipulating-a-matrix)

### [Reshaping](https://www.tradingview.com#reshaping)

The shape of a matrix can determine its compatibility with various
matrix operations. In some cases, it is necessary to change the
dimensions of a matrix without affecting the number of elements or the
values they reference, otherwise known as *reshaping*. To reshape a
matrix in Pine, use the
[matrix.reshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.reshape)
function.

This example demonstrates the results of multiple reshaping operations
on a matrix. The initial `m` matrix has a 1x8 shape (one row and eight
columns). Through successive calls to the
[m.reshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.reshape)
method, the script changes the shape of `m` to 2x4, 4x2, and 8x1. It
displays each reshaped matrix in a label on the chart using the custom
`debugLabel()` method:

![image](images/Matrices-Manipulating-a-matrix-Reshaping-1.DYGzopbC_Z2j7E98.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reshaping example")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A matrix containing the values 1-8.
matrix<int> m = matrix.new<int>()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Add the initial vector of values.
    m.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8))
    m.debugLabel(note = "Initial 1x8 matrix")

    // Reshape. `m` now has 2 rows and 4 columns.
    m.reshape(2, 4)
    m.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, note = "Reshaped to 2x4")

    // Reshape. `m` now has 4 rows and 2 columns.
    m.reshape(4, 2)
    m.debugLabel(bar_index + 20, note = "Reshaped to 4x2")

    // Reshape. `m` now has 8 rows and 1 column.
    m.reshape(8, 1)
    m.debugLabel(bar_index + 30, note = "Reshaped to 8x1")
```

Note that:

- The order of elements in `m` does not change with each
  `m.reshape()` call.
- When reshaping a matrix, the product of the `rows` and `columns`
  arguments must equal the
  [matrix.elements_count()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.elements_count)
  value, as
  [matrix.reshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.reshape)
  cannot change the number of elements in a matrix.

### [Reversing](https://www.tradingview.com#reversing)

One can reverse the order of all elements in a matrix using
[matrix.reverse()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.reverse).
This function moves the references of an m-by-n matrix `id` at the i-th
row and j-th column to the m - 1 - i row and n - 1 - j column.

For example, this script creates a 3x3 matrix containing the values 1-9
in ascending order, then uses the
[reverse()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.reverse)
method to reverse its contents. It displays the original and modified
versions of the matrix in labels on the chart via `m.debugLabel()`:

![image](images/Matrices-Manipulating-a-matrix-Reversing-1.Cgfm4aYH_1ccxk3.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reversing demo")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 3x3 matrix.
matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>()

// Add rows to `m`.
m.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3))
m.add_row(1, array.from(4, 5, 6))
m.add_row(2, array.from(7, 8, 9))

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Display the contents of `m`.
    m.debugLabel(note = "Original")
    // Reverse `m`, then display its contents.
    m.reverse()
    m.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, color.red, note = "Reversed")
```

### [Transposing](https://www.tradingview.com#transposing)

Transposing a matrix is a fundamental operation that flips all rows and
columns in a matrix about its *main diagonal* (the diagonal vector of
all values in which the row index equals the column index). This process
produces a new matrix with reversed row and column dimensions, known as
the *transpose*. Scripts can calculate the transpose of a matrix using
[matrix.transpose()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose).

For any m-row, n-column matrix, the matrix returned from
[matrix.transpose()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose)
will have n rows and m columns. All elements in a matrix at the i-th row
and j-th column correspond to the elements in its transpose at the j-th
row and i-th column.

This example declares a 2x4 `m` matrix, calculates its transpose using
the
[m.transpose()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose)
method, and displays both matrices on the chart using our custom
`debugLabel()` method. As we can see below, the transposed matrix has a
4x2 shape, and the rows of the transpose match the columns of the
original:

![image](images/Matrices-Manipulating-a-matrix-Transposing-1.DLTkeyZ__ZDefeU.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Transpose example")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 2x4 matrix.
matrix<int> m = matrix.new<int>()

// Add columns to `m`.
m.add_col(0, array.from(1, 5))
m.add_col(1, array.from(2, 6))
m.add_col(2, array.from(3, 7))
m.add_col(3, array.from(4, 8))

//@variable The transpose of `m`. Has a 4x2 shape.
matrix<int> mt = m.transpose()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    m.debugLabel(note = "Original")
    mt.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, note = "Transpose")
```

### [Sorting](https://www.tradingview.com#sorting)

Scripts can sort the contents of a matrix via
[matrix.sort()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.sort).
Unlike
[array.sort()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.sort),
which sorts *elements*, this function organizes all *rows* in a matrix
in a specified `order`
([order.ascending](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_order.ascending)
by default) based on the values in a specified `column`.

This script declares a 3x3 `m` matrix, sorts the rows of the `m1` copy
in ascending order based on the first column, then sorts the rows of the
`m2` copy in descending order based on the second column. It displays
the original matrix and sorted copies in labels using our `debugLabel()`
method:

![image](images/Matrices-Manipulating-a-matrix-Sorting-1.7v_kYwQL_ZOu1j2.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Sorting rows example")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 3x3 matrix.
matrix<int> m = matrix.new<int>()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Add rows to `m`.
    m.add_row(0, array.from(3, 2, 4))
    m.add_row(1, array.from(1, 9, 6))
    m.add_row(2, array.from(7, 8, 9))
    m.debugLabel(note = "Original")

    // Copy `m` and sort rows in ascending order based on the first column (default).
    matrix<int> m1 = m.copy()
    m1.sort()
    m1.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, color.green, note = "Sorted using col 0\n(Ascending)")

    // Copy `m` and sort rows in descending order based on the second column.
    matrix<int> m2 = m.copy()
    m2.sort(1, order.descending)
    m2.debugLabel(bar_index + 20, color.red, note = "Sorted using col 1\n(Descending)")
```

It's important to note that
[matrix.sort()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.sort)
does not sort the columns of a matrix. However, one *can* use this
function to sort matrix columns with the help of
[matrix.transpose()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose).

As an example, this script contains a `sortColumns()` method that uses
the
[sort()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.sort)
method to sort the
[transpose](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose)
of a matrix using the column corresponding to the `row` of the original
matrix. The script uses this method to sort the `m` matrix based on the
contents of its first row:

![image](images/Matrices-Manipulating-a-matrix-Sorting-2.BaU7IEP__2g88Bo.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Sorting columns example")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@function Sorts the columns of `this` matrix based on the values in the specified `row`.
method sortColumns(matrix<int> this, int row = 0, bool ascending = true) =>
    //@variable The transpose of `this` matrix.
    matrix<int> thisT = this.transpose()
    //@variable Is `order.ascending` when `ascending` is `true`, `order.descending` otherwise.
    order = ascending ? order.ascending : order.descending
    // Sort the rows of `thisT` using the `row` column.
    thisT.sort(row, order)
    //@variable A copy of `this` matrix with sorted columns.
    result = thisT.transpose()

//@variable A 3x3 matrix.
matrix<int> m = matrix.new<int>()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Add rows to `m`.
    m.add_row(0, array.from(3, 2, 4))
    m.add_row(1, array.from(1, 9, 6))
    m.add_row(2, array.from(7, 8, 9))
    m.debugLabel(note = "Original")

    // Sort the columns of `m` based on the first row and display the result.
    m.sortColumns(0).debugLabel(bar_index + 10, note = "Sorted using row 0\n(Ascending)")
```

### [Concatenating](https://www.tradingview.com#concatenating)

Scripts can *concatenate* two matrices using
[matrix.concat()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.concat).
This function appends the rows of an `id2` matrix to the end of an `id1`
matrix with the same number of columns.

To create a matrix with elements representing the *columns* of a matrix
appended to another,
[transpose](#transposing) both matrices, use
[matrix.concat()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.concat)
on the transposed matrices, then
[transpose()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose)
the result.

For example, this script appends the rows of the `m2` matrix to the `m1`
matrix and appends their columns using *transposed copies* of the
matrices. It displays the `m1` and `m2` matrices and the results after
concatenating their rows and columns in labels using the custom
`debugLabel()` method:

![image](images/Matrices-Manipulating-a-matrix-Concatenating-1.Dk8fPc4l_1FGbFm.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Concatenation demo")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 2x3 matrix filled with 1s.
matrix<int> m1 = matrix.new<int>(2, 3, 1)
//@variable A 2x3 matrix filled with 2s.
matrix<int> m2 = matrix.new<int>(2, 3, 2)

//@variable The transpose of `m1`.
t1 = m1.transpose()
//@variable The transpose of `m2`.
t2 = m2.transpose()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Display the original matrices.
    m1.debugLabel(note = "Matrix 1")
    m2.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, note = "Matrix 2")
    // Append the rows of `m2` to the end of `m1` and display `m1`.
    m1.concat(m2)
    m1.debugLabel(bar_index + 20, color.blue, note = "Appended rows")
    // Append the rows of `t2` to the end of `t1`, then display the transpose of `t1`.
    t1.concat(t2)
    t1.transpose().debugLabel(bar_index + 30, color.purple, note = "Appended columns")
```

## [Matrix calculations](https://www.tradingview.com#matrix-calculations)

### [Element-wise calculations](https://www.tradingview.com#element-wise-calculations)

Pine scripts can calculate the *average*, *minimum*, *maximum*, and
*mode* of all elements within a matrix via
[matrix.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.avg),
[matrix.min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.min),
[matrix.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.max),
and
[matrix.mode()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.mode).
These functions operate the same as their `array.*` equivalents,
allowing users to run element-wise calculations on a matrix, its
[submatrices](#submatrices), and its
[rows and columns](#rows-and-columns) using the same syntax. For example, the built-in `*.avg()`
functions called on a 3x3 matrix with values 1-9 and an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
with the same nine elements will both return a value of 5.

The script below uses `*.avg()`, `*.max()`, and `*.min()` methods to
calculate developing averages and extremes of OHLC data in a period. It
adds a new column of
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low),
and
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
values to the end of the `ohlcData` matrix whenever `queueColumn` is
`true`. When `false`, the script uses the

and
[set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.set)
matrix methods to adjust the elements in the last column for developing
HLC values in the current period. It uses the `ohlcData` matrix, a
[submatrix()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.submatrix),
and

### [Special calculations](https://www.tradingview.com#special-calculations)

and
[matrix.kron()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.kron).
These functions are advanced features that facilitate a variety of
matrix calculations and transformations.

Below, we explain a few fundamental functions with some basic examples.

#### [`matrix.sum()` and `matrix.diff()`](https://www.tradingview.com#matrixsum-and-matrixdiff)

Scripts can perform addition and subtraction of two matrices with the
same shape or a matrix and a scalar value using the
[matrix.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.sum)
and
[matrix.diff()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.diff)
functions. These functions use the values from the `id2` matrix or
scalar to add to or subtract from the elements in `id1`.

This script demonstrates a simple example of matrix addition and
subtraction in Pine. It creates a 3x3 matrix, calculates its
[transpose](#transposing), then calculates the
[matrix.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.sum)
and
[matrix.diff()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.diff)
of the two matrices. This example displays the original matrix, its
[transpose](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose),
and the resulting sum and difference matrices in labels on the chart:

![image](images/Matrices-Matrix-calculations-Special-calculations-1.CqDsJl37_RrqVF.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Matrix sum and diff example")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 3x3 matrix.
m = matrix.new<float>()

// Add rows to `m`.
m.add_row(0, array.from(0.5, 1.0, 1.5))
m.add_row(1, array.from(2.0, 2.5, 3.0))
m.add_row(2, array.from(3.5, 4.0, 4.5))

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Display `m`.
    m.debugLabel(note = "A")
    // Get and display the transpose of `m`.
    matrix<float> t = m.transpose()
    t.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, note = "Aᵀ")
    // Calculate the sum of the two matrices. The resulting matrix is symmetric.
    matrix.sum(m, t).debugLabel(bar_index + 20, color.green, note = "A + Aᵀ")
    // Calculate the difference between the two matrices. The resulting matrix is antisymmetric.
    matrix.diff(m, t).debugLabel(bar_index + 30, color.red, note = "A - Aᵀ")
```

Note that:

- In this example, we've labeled the original matrix as "A" and
  the transpose as "Aᵀ".
- Adding "A" and "Aᵀ" produces a
  [symmetric](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_symmetric)
  matrix, and subtracting them produces an
  [antisymmetric](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_antisymmetric)
  matrix.

#### [`matrix.mult()`](https://www.tradingview.com#matrixmult)

Scripts can multiply two matrices via the
[matrix.mult()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.mult)
function. This function also facilitates the multiplication of a matrix
by an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
or a scalar value.

In the case of multiplying two matrices, unlike addition and
subtraction, matrix multiplication does not require two matrices to
share the same shape. However, the number of columns in the first matrix
must equal the number of rows in the second one. The resulting matrix
returned by
[matrix.mult()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.mult)
will contain the same number of rows as `id1` and the same number of
columns as `id2`. For instance, a 2x3 matrix multiplied by a 3x4 matrix
will produce a matrix with two rows and four columns, as shown below.
Each value within the resulting matrix is the [dot
product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) of the corresponding
row in `id1` and column in `id2`:

![image](images/Matrices-Matrix-calculations-Special-calculations-2.B9VMtj33_ZXAisD.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Matrix mult example")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 2x3 matrix.
a = matrix.new<float>()
//@variable A 3x4 matrix.
b = matrix.new<float>()

// Add rows to `a`.
a.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3))
a.add_row(1, array.from(4, 5, 6))

// Add rows to `b`.
b.add_row(0, array.from(0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0))
b.add_row(1, array.from(2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0))
b.add_row(0, array.from(4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0))

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    //@variable The result of `a` * `b`.
    matrix<float> ab = a.mult(b)
    // Display `a`, `b`, and `ab` matrices.
    debugLabel(a, note = "A")
    debugLabel(b, bar_index + 10, note = "B")
    debugLabel(ab, bar_index + 20, color.green, note = "A * B")
```

Note that:

- In contrast to the multiplication of scalars, matrix
  multiplication is *non-commutative*, i.e., `matrix.mult(a, b)`
  does not necessarily produce the same result as
  `matrix.mult(b, a)`. In the context of our example, the latter
  will raise a runtime error because the number of columns in `b`
  doesn't equal the number of rows in `a`.

When multiplying a matrix and an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
this function treats the operation the same as multiplying `id1` by a
single-column matrix, but it returns an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
with the same number of elements as the number of rows in `id1`. When
[matrix.mult()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.mult)
passes a scalar as its `id2` value, the function returns a new matrix
whose elements are the elements in `id1` multiplied by the `id2` value.

#### [`matrix.det()`](https://www.tradingview.com#matrixdet)

A *determinant* is a scalar value associated with a
[square](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_square)
matrix that describes some of its characteristics, namely its
invertibility. If a matrix has an
[inverse](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.inv),
its determinant is nonzero. Otherwise, the matrix is *singular*
(non-invertible). Scripts can calculate the determinant of a matrix via
[matrix.det()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.det).

Programmers can use determinants to detect similarities between
matrices, identify *full-rank* and *rank-deficient* matrices, and solve
systems of linear equations, among other applications.

For example, this script utilizes determinants to solve a system of
linear equations with a matching number of unknown values using
[Cramer's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer's_rule). The
user-defined `solve()` function returns an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
containing solutions for each unknown value in the system, where the
n-th element of the array is the determinant of the coefficient matrix
with the n-th column replaced by the column of constants divided by the
determinant of the original coefficients.

In this script, we've defined the matrix `m` that holds coefficients
and constants for these three equations:

```
3 * x0 + 4 * x1 - 1 * x2 = 85 * x0 - 2 * x1 + 1 * x2 = 42 * x0 - 2 * x1 + 1 * x2 = 1
```

The solution to this system is `(x0 = 1, x1 = 2, x2 = 3)`. The script
calculates these values from `m` via `m.solve()` and plots them on the
chart:

![image](images/Matrices-Matrix-calculations-Special-calculations-3.Bq84ZoEi_1X2sQR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Determinants example", "Cramer's Rule")

//@function Solves a system of linear equations with a matching number of unknowns using Cramer's rule.
//@param    this An augmented matrix containing the coefficients for each unknown and the results of
//          the equations. For example, a row containing the values 2, -1, and 3 represents the equation
//          `2 * x0 + (-1) * x1 = 3`, where `x0` and `x1` are the unknown values in the system.
//@returns  An array containing solutions for each variable in the system.
solve(matrix<float> this) =>
    //@variable The coefficient matrix for the system of equations.
    matrix<float> coefficients = this.submatrix(from_column = 0, to_column = this.columns() - 1)
    //@variable The array of resulting constants for each equation.
    array<float> constants = this.col(this.columns() - 1)
    //@variable An array containing solutions for each unknown in the system.
    array<float> result = array.new<float>()

    //@variable The determinant value of the coefficient matrix.
    float baseDet = coefficients.det()
    matrix<float> modified = na
    for col = 0 to coefficients.columns() - 1        
        modified := coefficients.copy()
        modified.add_col(col, constants)
        modified.remove_col(col + 1)

        // Calculate the solution for the column's unknown by dividing the determinant of `modified` by the `baseDet`.
        result.push(modified.det() / baseDet)

    result

//@variable A 3x4 matrix containing coefficients and results for a system of three equations.
m = matrix.new<float>()

// Add rows for the following equations:
// Equation 1: 3 * x0 + 4 * x1 - 1 * x2 = 8
// Equation 2: 5 * x0 - 2 * x1 + 1 * x2 = 4
// Equation 3: 2 * x0 - 2 * x1 + 1 * x2 = 1
m.add_row(0, array.from(3.0, 4.0, -1.0, 8.0))
m.add_row(1, array.from(5.0, -2.0, 1.0, 4.0))
m.add_row(2, array.from(2.0, -2.0, 1.0, 1.0))

//@variable An array of solutions to the unknowns in the system of equations represented by `m`.
solutions = solve(m)

plot(solutions.get(0), "x0", color.red, 3)   // Plots 1.
plot(solutions.get(1), "x1", color.green, 3) // Plots 2.
plot(solutions.get(2), "x2", color.blue, 3)  // Plots 3.
```

Note that:

- Solving systems of equations is particularly useful for
  *regression analysis*, e.g., linear and polynomial regression.
- Cramer's rule works fine for small systems of equations.
  However, it's computationally inefficient on larger systems.
  Other methods, such as [Gaussian
  elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination),
  are often preferred for such use cases.

#### [`matrix.inv()` and `matrix.pinv()`](https://www.tradingview.com#matrixinv-and-matrixpinv)

For any non-singular
[square](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_square)
matrix, there is an inverse matrix that yields the
[identity](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_identity)
matrix when
[multiplied](#matrixmult) by the original. Inverses have utility in various matrix
transformations and solving systems of equations. Scripts can calculate
the inverse of a matrix **when one exists** via the
[matrix.inv()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.inv)
function.

For singular (non-invertible) matrices, one can calculate a generalized
inverse
([pseudoinverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse)),
regardless of whether the matrix is square or has a nonzero [determinant](#matrixdet), via the
[matrix.pinv()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.pinv)
function. Keep in mind that unlike a true inverse, the product of a
pseudoinverse and the original matrix does not necessarily equal the
identity matrix unless the original matrix *is invertible*.

The following example forms a 2x2 `m` matrix from user inputs, then uses
the
[m.inv()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.inv)
and
[m.pinv()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.pinv)
methods to calculate the inverse or pseudoinverse of `m`. The script
displays the original matrix, its inverse or pseudoinverse, and their
product in labels on the chart:

![image](images/Matrices-Matrix-calculations-Special-calculations-4.BXfICGI-_Z1Y52Ud.png)

```
//@version=6

// Element inputs for the 2x2 matrix.
float r0c0 = input.float(4.0, "Row 0, Col 0")
float r0c1 = input.float(3.0, "Row 0, Col 1")
float r1c0 = input.float(2.0, "Row 1, Col 0")
float r1c1 = input.float(1.0, "Row 1, Col 1")

//@function Displays the rows of a matrix in a label with a note.
//@param    this The matrix to display.
//@param    barIndex The `bar_index` to display the label at.
//@param    bgColor The background color of the label.
//@param    textColor The color of the label's text.
//@param    note The text to display above the rows.
method debugLabel(
     matrix<float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    labelText = note + "\n" + str.tostring(this)
    if barstate.ishistory
        label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

//@variable A 2x2 matrix of input values.
m = matrix.new<float>()

// Add input values to `m`.
m.add_row(0, array.from(r0c0, r0c1))
m.add_row(1, array.from(r1c0, r1c1))

//@variable Is `true` if `m` is square with a nonzero determinant, indicating invertibility.
bool isInvertible = m.is_square() and m.det() != 0

//@variable The inverse or pseudoinverse of `m`.
mInverse = isInvertible ? m.inv() : m.pinv()

//@variable The product of `m` and `mInverse`. Returns the identity matrix when `isInvertible` is `true`.
matrix<float> product = m.mult(mInverse)

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Display `m`, `mInverse`, and their `product`.
    m.debugLabel(note = "Original")
    mInverse.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, color.purple, note = isInvertible ? "Inverse" : "Pseudoinverse")
    product.debugLabel(bar_index + 20, color.green, note = "Product")
```

Note that:

- This script will only call
  [m.inv()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.inv)
  when `isInvertible` is `true`, i.e., when `m` is
  [square](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.is_square)
  and has a nonzero
  [determinant](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.det).
  Otherwise, it uses
  [m.pinv()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.pinv)
  to calculate the generalized inverse.

#### [`matrix.rank()`](https://www.tradingview.com#matrixrank)

The *rank* of a matrix represents the number of linearly independent
vectors (rows or columns) it contains. In essence, matrix rank measures
the number of vectors one cannot express as a linear combination of
others, or in other words, the number of vectors that contain **unique**
information. Scripts can calculate the rank of a matrix via
[matrix.rank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rank).

This script identifies the number of linearly independent vectors in two
3x3 matrices (`m1` and `m2`) and plots the values in a separate pane. As
we see on the chart, the
[m1.rank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rank)
value is 3 because each vector is unique. The
[m2.rank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rank)
value, on the other hand, is 1 because it has just one unique vector:

![image](images/Matrices-Matrix-calculations-Special-calculations-5.DU77KrgW_Z14e0aC.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Matrix rank example")

//@variable A 3x3 full-rank matrix.
m1 = matrix.new<float>()
//@variable A 3x3 rank-deficient matrix.
m2 = matrix.new<float>()

// Add linearly independent vectors to `m1`.
m1.add_row(0, array.from(3, 2, 3))
m1.add_row(1, array.from(4, 6, 6))
m1.add_row(2, array.from(7, 4, 9))

// Add linearly dependent vectors to `m2`.
m2.add_row(0, array.from(1, 2, 3))
m2.add_row(1, array.from(2, 4, 6))
m2.add_row(2, array.from(3, 6, 9))

// Plot `matrix.rank()` values.
plot(m1.rank(), color = color.green, linewidth = 3)
plot(m2.rank(), color = color.red, linewidth = 3)
```

Note that:

- The highest rank value a matrix can have is the minimum of its
  number of rows and columns. A matrix with the maximum possible
  rank is known as a *full-rank* matrix, and any matrix without
  full rank is known as a *rank-deficient* matrix.
- The
  [determinants](#matrixdet) of full-rank square matrices are nonzero, and such
  matrices have
  [inverses](#matrixinv-and-matrixpinv). Conversely, the
  [determinant](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.det)
  of a rank-deficient matrix is always 0.
- For any matrix that contains nothing but the same value in each
  of its elements (e.g., a matrix filled with 0), the rank is
  always 0 since none of the vectors hold unique information. For
  any other matrix with distinct values, the minimum possible rank
  is 1.

## [Error handling](https://www.tradingview.com#error-handling)

In addition to usual **compiler** errors, which occur during a script's
compilation due to improper syntax, scripts using matrices can raise
specific **runtime** errors during their execution. When a script raises
a runtime error, it displays a red exclamation point next to the script
title. Users can view the error message by clicking this icon.

In this section, we discuss runtime errors that users may encounter
while utilizing matrices in their scripts.

### [The row/column index (xx) is out of bounds, row/column size is (yy).](https://www.tradingview.com#the-rowcolumn-index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-rowcolumn-size-is-yy)

This runtime error occurs when trying to access indices outside the
matrix dimensions with functions including
[matrix.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.get),
[matrix.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.set),
[matrix.fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.fill),
and
[matrix.submatrix()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.submatrix),
as well as some of the functions relating to the
[rows and columns](#rows-and-columns) of a matrix.

For example, this code contains two lines that will produce this runtime
error. The
[m.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.set)
method references a `row` index that doesn't exist (2). The
[m.submatrix()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.submatrix)
method references all column indices up to `to_column - 1`. A
`to_column` value of 4 results in a runtime error because the last
column index referenced (3) does not exist in `m`:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Out of bounds demo")

//@variable A 2x3 matrix with a max row index of 1 and max column index of 2. 
matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>(2, 3, 0.0)

m.set(row = 2, column = 0, value = 1.0)     // The `row` index is out of bounds on this line. The max value is 1.
m.submatrix(from_column = 1, to_column = 4) // The `to_column` index is invalid on this line. The max value is 3.

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    label.new(bar_index, 0, str.tostring(m), color = color.navy, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge)
```

Users can avoid this error in their scripts by ensuring their function
calls do not reference indices greater than or equal to the number of
rows/columns.

### [The array size does not match the number of rows/columns in the matrix.](https://www.tradingview.com#the-array-size-does-not-match-the-number-of-rowscolumns-in-the-matrix)

When using
[matrix.add_row()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_row)
and
[matrix.add_col()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.add_col)
functions to
[insert](#inserting) rows and columns into a non-empty matrix, the size of the
inserted array must align with the matrix dimensions. The size of an
inserted row must match the number of columns, and the size of an
inserted column must match the number of rows. Otherwise, the script
will raise this runtime error. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Invalid array size demo")

// Declare an empty matrix.
m = matrix.new<float>()

m.add_col(0, array.from(1, 2))    // Add a column. Changes the shape of `m` to 2x1.
m.add_col(1, array.from(1, 2, 3)) // Raises a runtime error because `m` has 2 rows, not 3. 

plot(m.col(0).get(1))
```

Note that:

- When `m` is empty, one can insert a row or column array of *any*
  size, as shown in the first `m.add_col()` line.

### [Cannot call matrix methods when the ID of matrix is 'na'.](https://www.tradingview.com#cannot-call-matrix-methods-when-the-id-of-matrix-is-na)

When a matrix variable is assigned to `na`, it means that the variable
doesn't reference an existing object. Consequently, one cannot use
built-in `matrix.*()` functions and methods with it. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("na matrix methods demo") 

//@variable A `matrix` variable assigned to `na`.
matrix<float> m = na

mCopy = m.copy() // Raises a runtime error. You can't copy a matrix that doesn't exist.

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    label.new(bar_index, 0, str.tostring(mCopy), color = color.navy, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge)
```

To resolve this error, assign `m` to a valid matrix instance before
using `matrix.*()` functions.

### [Matrix is too large. Maximum size of the matrix is 100,000 elements.](https://www.tradingview.com#matrix-is-too-large-maximum-size-of-the-matrix-is-100000-elements)

The total number of elements in a matrix
([matrix.elements_count()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.elements_count))
cannot exceed **100,000**, regardless of its shape. For example, this
script will raise an error because it
[inserts](#inserting) 1000 rows with 101 elements into the `m` matrix:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Matrix too large demo") 

var matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>()

if bar_index == 0
    for i = 1 to 1000
        // This raises an error because the script adds 101 elements on each iteration.
        // 1000 rows * 101 elements per row = 101000 total elements. This is too large.
        m.add_row(m.rows(), array.new<float>(101, i))

plot(m.get(0, 0))
```

### [The row/column index must be 0 <= from_row/column < to_row/column.](https://www.tradingview.com#the-rowcolumn-index-must-be-0--from_rowcolumn--to_rowcolumn)

When using `matrix.*()` functions with `from_row/column` and
`to_row/column` indices, the `from_*` values must be less than the
corresponding `to_*` values, with the minimum possible value being 0.
Otherwise, the script will raise a runtime error.

For example, this script shows an attempt to declare a
[submatrix](#submatrices) from a 4x4 `m` matrix with a `from_row` value of 2 and a
`to_row` value of 2, which will result in an error:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Invalid from_row, to_row demo") 

//@variable A 4x4 matrix filled with a random value. 
matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>(4, 4, math.random())

matrix<float> mSub = m.submatrix(from_row = 2, to_row = 2) // Raises an error. `from_row` can't equal `to_row`.

plot(mSub.get(0, 0))
```

### [Matrices 'id1' and 'id2' must have an equal number of rows and columns to be added.](https://www.tradingview.com#matrices-id1-and-id2-must-have-an-equal-number-of-rows-and-columns-to-be-added)

When using
[matrix.sum() and matrix.diff()](#matrixsum-and-matrixdiff) functions, the `id1` and `id2` matrices must have the same
number of rows and the same number of columns. Attempting to add or
subtract two matrices with mismatched dimensions will raise an error, as
demonstrated by this code:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Invalid sum dimensions demo") 

//@variable A 2x3 matrix. 
matrix<float> m1 = matrix.new<float>(2, 3, 1)
//@variable A 3x4 matrix.
matrix<float> m2 = matrix.new<float>(3, 4, 2)

mSum = matrix.sum(m1, m2) // Raises an error. `m1` and `m2` don't have matching dimensions.

plot(mSum.get(0, 0))
```

### [The number of columns in the 'id1' matrix must equal the number of rows in the matrix (or the number of elements in the array) 'id2'.](https://www.tradingview.com#the-number-of-columns-in-the-id1-matrix-must-equal-the-number-of-rows-in-the-matrix-or-the-number-of-elements-in-the-array-id2)

When using
[matrix.mult()](#matrixmult) to multiply an `id1` matrix by an `id2` matrix or array, the
[matrix.rows()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.rows)
or
[array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
of `id2` must equal the
[matrix.columns()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.columns)
in `id1`. If they don't align, the script will raise this error.

For example, this script tries to multiply two 2x3 matrices. While
*adding* these matrices is possible, *multiplying* them is not:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Invalid mult dimensions demo") 

//@variable A 2x3 matrix. 
matrix<float> m1 = matrix.new<float>(2, 3, 1)
//@variable A 2x3 matrix.
matrix<float> m2 = matrix.new<float>(2, 3, 2)

mSum = matrix.mult(m1, m2) // Raises an error. The number of columns in `m1` and rows in `m2` aren't equal.

plot(mSum.get(0, 0))
```

### [Operation not available for non-square matrices.](https://www.tradingview.com#operation-not-available-for-non-square-matrices)

Some matrix operations, including
[matrix.inv()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.inv),
[matrix.det()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.det),
[matrix.eigenvalues()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.eigenvalues),
and
[matrix.eigenvectors()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.inv)
only work with **square** matrices, i.e., matrices with the same number
of rows and columns. When attempting to execute such functions on
non-square matrices, the script will raise an error stating the
operation isn't available or that it cannot calculate the result for
the matrix `id`. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Non-square demo") 

//@variable A 3x5 matrix. 
matrix<float> m = matrix.new<float>(3, 5, 1)

plot(m.det()) // Raises a runtime error. You can't calculate the determinant of a 3x5 matrix.
```

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Language](#execution-model)/Maps

ADVANCED

# [Maps](https://www.tradingview.com#maps)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ Maps are collections that store elements in *key-value
pairs*. They allow scripts to collect multiple value references
associated with unique identifiers (keys).

Unlike [arrays](#arrays) and
[matrices](#matrices), maps are *unordered* collections. Scripts quickly access a map's
values by referencing the keys from the key-value pairs put into them
rather than traversing an internal index.

A map's keys can be of any [fundamental type](#types) or [enum type](#enum-types),
and its values can be of any available type. Maps cannot directly use other [collections](#collections) (maps, [arrays](#arrays), or [matrices](#matrices)) as values, but they can hold [UDT](#user-defined-types) instances containing these data structures within their fields. See [this section](#maps-of-other-collections) for more information.

As with other collections, maps can contain up to 100,000 elements in
total. Since each key-value pair in a map consists of two elements (a
unique *key* and its associated *value*), the maximum number of
key-value pairs a map can hold is 50,000.

## [Declaring a map](https://www.tradingview.com#declaring-a-map)

Pine Script™ uses the following syntax to declare maps:

```
[var/varip ][map<keyType, valueType> ]<identifier> = <expression>
```

Where `<keyType, valueType>` is the map's
[type template](#type-templates) that declares the types of keys and values it will contain,
and the `<expression>` returns either a map instance or `na`.

When declaring a map variable assigned to `na`, users must include the
[map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
keyword followed by a
[type template](#type-templates) to tell the compiler that the variable can accept maps with
`keyType` keys and `valueType` values.

For example, this line of code declares a new `myMap` variable that can
accept map instances holding pairs of
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
keys and
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
values:

```
map<string, float> myMap = na
```

When the `<expression>` is not `na`, the compiler does not require
explicit type declaration, as it will infer the type information from
the assigned map object.

This line declares a `myMap` variable assigned to an empty map with
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
keys and
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
values. Any maps assigned to this variable later must have the same key
and value types:

```
myMap = map.new<string, float>()
```

### [Using `var` and `varip` keywords](https://www.tradingview.com#using-var-and-varip-keywords)

Users can include the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keywords to instruct their scripts to declare map variables only on the
first chart bar. Variables that use these keywords point to the same map
instances on each script iteration until explicitly reassigned.

For example, this script declares a `colorMap` variable assigned to a
map that holds pairs of
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
keys and
[color](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_color)
values on the first chart bar. The script displays an `oscillator` on
the chart and uses the values it
[put](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
into the `colorMap` on the *first* bar to color the plots on *all* bars:

![image](images/Maps-Declaring-a-map-Using-var-and-varip-keywords-1.DMKyDQUN_ZNaztD.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("var map demo")

//@variable A map associating color values with string keys.
var colorMap = map.new<string, color>()

// Put `<string, color>` pairs into `colorMap` on the first bar.
if bar_index == 0
    colorMap.put("Bull", color.green)
    colorMap.put("Bear", color.red)
    colorMap.put("Neutral", color.gray)

//@variable The 14-bar RSI of `close`.
float oscillator = ta.rsi(close, 14)

//@variable The color of the `oscillator`.
color oscColor = switch
    oscillator > 50 => colorMap.get("Bull")
    oscillator < 50 => colorMap.get("Bear")
    =>                 colorMap.get("Neutral")

// Plot the `oscillator` using the `oscColor` from our `colorMap`.
plot(oscillator, "Histogram", oscColor, 2, plot.style_histogram, histbase = 50)
plot(oscillator, "Line", oscColor, 3)
```

## [Reading and writing](https://www.tradingview.com#reading-and-writing)

### [Putting and getting key-value pairs](https://www.tradingview.com#putting-and-getting-key-value-pairs)

The
[map.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
function is one that map users will utilize quite often, as it's the
primary method to put a new key-value pair into a map. It associates the
`key` argument with the `value` argument in the call and adds the pair
to the map `id`.

If the `key` argument in the
[map.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
call already exists in the map's
[keys](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys),
the new pair passed into the function will **replace** the existing one.

To retrieve the value from a map `id` associated with a given `key`, use
[map.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.get).
This function returns the value if the `id` map
[contains](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.contains)
the `key`. Otherwise, it returns
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

The following example calculates the difference between the
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
values from when
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
was last
[rising](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rising)
and
[falling](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.falling)
over a given `length` with the help of
[map.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
and
[map.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.get)
methods. The script puts a `("Rising", bar_index)` pair into the `data`
map when the price is rising and puts a `("Falling", bar_index)` pair
into the map when the price is falling. It then puts a pair containing
the "Difference" between the "Rising" and "Falling" values into
the map and plots its value on the chart:

![image](images/Maps-Reading-and-writing-Putting-and-getting-key-value-pairs-1.CnULguMa_ZMFlOi.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Putting and getting demo")

//@variable The length of the `ta.rising()` and `ta.falling()` calculation.
int length = input.int(2, "Length")

//@variable A map associating `string` keys with `int` values.
var data = map.new<string, int>()

// Put a new ("Rising", `bar_index`) pair into the `data` map when `close` is rising.
if ta.rising(close, length)
    data.put("Rising", bar_index)
// Put a new ("Falling", `bar_index`) pair into the `data` map when `close` is falling.
if ta.falling(close, length)
    data.put("Falling", bar_index)

// Put the "Difference" between current "Rising" and "Falling" values into the `data` map.
data.put("Difference", data.get("Rising") - data.get("Falling"))

//@variable The difference between the last "Rising" and "Falling" `bar_index`.
int index = data.get("Difference")

//@variable Returns `color.green` when `index` is positive, `color.red` when negative, and `color.gray` otherwise.
color indexColor = index > 0 ? color.green : index < 0 ? color.red : color.gray

plot(index, color = indexColor, style = plot.style_columns)
```

Note that:

- This script replaces the values associated with the "Rising",
  "Falling", and "Difference" keys on successive
  [data.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
  calls, as each of these keys is unique and can only appear once
  in the `data` map.
- Replacing the pairs in a map does not change the internal
  *insertion order* of its keys. We discuss this further in the
  [next section](#inspecting-keys-and-values).

Similar to working with other collections, when putting a value of a
*special type*
([line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table),
or
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point))
or a
[user-defined type](#user-defined-types) into a map, it's important to note the inserted pair's
`value` points to that same object without copying it. Modifying the
value referenced by a key-value pair will also affect the original
object.

For example, this script contains a custom `ChartData` type with `o`,
`h`, `l`, and `c` fields. On the first chart bar, the script declares a
`myMap` variable and adds the pair `("A", myData)`, where `myData` is a
`ChartData` instance with initial field values of `na`. It adds the pair
`("B", myData)` to `myMap` and updates the object from this pair on
every bar via the user-defined `update()` method.

Each change to the object with the "B" key affects the one referenced
by the "A" key, as shown by the candle plot of the "A" object's
fields:

![image](images/Maps-Reading-and-writing-Putting-and-getting-key-value-pairs-2.wNHX2-4R_Z21EdVP.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Putting and getting objects demo")

//@type A custom type to hold OHLC data.
type ChartData
    float o
    float h
    float l
    float c

//@function Updates the fields of a `ChartData` object.
method update(ChartData this) =>
    this.o := open
    this.h := high
    this.l := low
    this.c := close

//@variable A new `ChartData` instance declared on the first bar.
var myData = ChartData.new()
//@variable A map associating `string` keys with `ChartData` instances.
var myMap = map.new<string, ChartData>()

// Put a new pair with the "A" key into `myMap` only on the first bar.
if bar_index == 0
    myMap.put("A", myData)

// Put a pair with the "B" key into `myMap` on every bar.
myMap.put("B", myData)

//@variable The `ChartData` value associated with the "A" key in `myMap`.
ChartData oldest = myMap.get("A")
//@variable The `ChartData` value associated with the "B" key in `myMap`.
ChartData newest = myMap.get("B")

// Update `newest`. Also affects `oldest` and `myData` since they all reference the same `ChartData` object.
newest.update()

// Plot the fields of `oldest` as candles.
plotcandle(oldest.o, oldest.h, oldest.l, oldest.c)
```

Note that:

- This script would behave differently if it passed a copy of
  `myData` into each
  [myMap.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
  call. For more information, see
  [this](#copying-objects) section of our User Manual's page on
  [objects](#objects).

### [Inspecting keys and values](https://www.tradingview.com#inspecting-keys-and-values)

#### [`map.keys()` and `map.values()`](https://www.tradingview.com#mapkeys-and-mapvalues)

To retrieve all keys and values put into a map, use
[map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys)
and
[map.values()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.values).
These functions copy all key/value references within a map `id` to a new
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
object. Modifying the array returned from either of these functions does
not affect the `id` map.

Although maps are *unordered* collections, Pine Script™ internally
maintains the *insertion order* of a map's key-value pairs. As a
result, the
[map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys)
and
[map.values()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.values)
functions always return [arrays](#arrays) with their elements ordered based on the `id` map's
insertion order.

The script below demonstrates this by displaying the key and value
arrays from an `m` map in a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
once every 50 bars. As we see on the chart, the order of elements in
each array returned by `m.keys()` and `m.values()` aligns with the
insertion order of the key-value pairs in `m`:

![image](images/Maps-Reading-and-writing-Inspecting-keys-and-values-1.BtySOORc_ZqH8ET.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Keys and values demo")

if bar_index % 50 == 0
    //@variable A map containing pairs of `string` keys and `float` values.
    m = map.new<string, float>()

    // Put pairs into `m`. The map will maintain this insertion order.
    m.put("First", math.round(math.random(0, 100)))
    m.put("Second", m.get("First") + 1)
    m.put("Third", m.get("Second") + 1)

    //@variable An array containing the keys of `m` in their insertion order.
    array<string> keys = m.keys()
    //@variable An array containing the values of `m` in their insertion order.
    array<float> values = m.values()

    //@variable A label displaying the `size` of `m` and the `keys` and `values` arrays.
    label debugLabel = label.new(
         bar_index, 0,
         str.format("Pairs: {0}\nKeys: {1}\nValues: {2}", m.size(), keys, values),
         color = color.navy, style = label.style_label_center, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
     )
```

Note that:

- The value with the "First" key is a
  [random](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random)
  whole number between 0 and 100. The "Second" value is one
  greater than the "First", and the "Third" value is one
  greater than the "Second".

It's important to note a map's internal insertion order **does not**
change when replacing its key-value pairs. The locations of the new
elements in the
[keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys)
and
[values()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.values)
arrays will be the same as the old elements in such cases. The only
exception is if the script completely
[removes](#removing-key-value-pairs) the key beforehand.

Below, we've added a line of code to
[put](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
a new value with the "Second" key into the `m` map, overwriting the
previous value associated with that key. Although the script puts this
new pair into the map *after* the one with the "Third" key, the
pair's key and value are still second in the `keys` and `values` arrays
since the key was already present in `m`*before* the change:

![image](images/Maps-Reading-and-writing-Inspecting-keys-and-values-2.CRhK5y_B_Z25ivPS.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Keys and values demo")

if bar_index % 50 == 0
    //@variable A map containing pairs of `string` keys and `float` values.
    m = map.new<string, float>()

    // Put pairs into `m`. The map will maintain this insertion order.
    m.put("First", math.round(math.random(0, 100)))
    m.put("Second", m.get("First") + 1)
    m.put("Third", m.get("Second") + 1)

    // Overwrite the "Second" pair in `m`. This will NOT affect the insertion order.
    // The key and value will still appear second in the `keys` and `values` arrays.
    m.put("Second", -2)

    //@variable An array containing the keys of `m` in their insertion order.
    array<string> keys = m.keys()
    //@variable An array containing the values of `m` in their insertion order.
    array<float> values = m.values()

    //@variable A label displaying the `size` of `m` and the `keys` and `values` arrays.
    label debugLabel = label.new(
         bar_index, 0,
         str.format("Pairs: {0}\nKeys: {1}\nValues: {2}", m.size(), keys, values),
         color = color.navy, style = label.style_label_center, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
     )
```

#### [`map.contains()`](https://www.tradingview.com#mapcontains)

To check if a specific `key` exists within a map `id`, use
[map.contains()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.contains).
This function is a convenient alternative to calling
[array.includes()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.includes)
on the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
returned from
[map.keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys).

For example, this script checks if various keys exist within an `m` map,
then displays the results in a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label):

![image](images/Maps-Reading-and-writing-Inspecting-keys-and-values-3.BFc856qo_2slIVc.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Inspecting keys demo")

//@variable A map containing `string` keys and `string` values.
m = map.new<string, string>()

// Put key-value pairs into the map.
m.put("A", "B")
m.put("C", "D")
m.put("E", "F")

//@variable An array of keys to check for in `m`.
array<string> testKeys = array.from("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F")

//@variable An array containing all elements from `testKeys` found in the keys of `m`.
array<string> mappedKeys = array.new<string>()

for key in testKeys
    // Add the `key` to `mappedKeys` if `m` contains it.
    if m.contains(key)
        mappedKeys.push(key)

//@variable A string representing the `testKeys` array and the elements found within the keys of `m`.
string testText = str.format("Tested keys: {0}\nKeys found: {1}", testKeys, mappedKeys)

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    //@variable Displays the `testText` in a label at the `bar_index` before the last.
    label debugLabel = label.new(
         bar_index, 0, testText, style = label.style_label_center, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
     )
```

### [Removing key-value pairs](https://www.tradingview.com#removing-key-value-pairs)

To remove a specific key-value pair from a map `id`, use
[map.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.remove).
This function removes the `key` and its associated value from the map
while preserving the insertion order of other key-value pairs. It
returns the removed value if the map
[contained](#mapcontains) the `key`. Otherwise, it returns
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

To remove all key-value pairs from a map `id` at once, use
[map.clear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.clear).

The following script creates a new `m` map,
[puts](#putting-and-getting-key-value-pairs) key-value pairs into the map, uses
[m.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.remove)
within a loop to remove each valid `key` listed in the `removeKeys`
array, then calls
[m.clear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.clear)
to remove all remaining key-value pairs. It uses a custom `debugLabel()`
method to display the
[size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.size),
[keys](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys),
and
[values](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.values)
of `m` after each change:

![image](images/Maps-Reading-and-writing-Removing-key-value-pairs-1.vUrgRJdK_Z11m7iy.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Removing key-value pairs demo")

//@function Returns a label to display the keys and values from a map.
method debugLabel(
     map<string, int> this, int barIndex = bar_index,
     color bgColor = color.blue, string note = ""
 ) =>
    //@variable A string representing the size, keys, and values in `this` map.
    string repr = str.format(
         "{0}\nSize: {1}\nKeys: {2}\nValues: {3}",
         note, this.size(), str.tostring(this.keys()), str.tostring(this.values())
     )
    label.new(
         barIndex, 0, repr, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center,
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
     )

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    //@variable A map containing `string` keys and `int` values.
    m = map.new<string, int>()

    // Put key-value pairs into `m`.
    for [i, key] in array.from("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
        m.put(key, i)
    m.debugLabel(bar_index, color.green, "Added pairs")

    //@variable An array of keys to remove from `m`.
    array<string> removeKeys = array.from("B", "B", "D", "F", "a")

    // Remove each `key` in `removeKeys` from `m`.
    for key in removeKeys
        m.remove(key)
    m.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, color.red, "Removed pairs")

    // Remove all remaining keys from `m`.
    m.clear()
    m.debugLabel(bar_index + 20, color.purple, "Cleared the map")
```

Note that:

- Not all strings in the `removeKeys` array were present in the
  keys of `m`. Attempting to remove non-existent keys ("F",
  "a", and the second "B" in this example) has no effect on a
  map's contents.

### [Combining maps](https://www.tradingview.com#combining-maps)

Scripts can combine two maps via
[map.put_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put_all).
This function puts *all* key-value pairs from the `id2` map, in their
insertion order, into the `id1` map. As with
[map.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put),
if any keys in `id2` are also present in `id1`, this function
**replaces** the key-value pairs that contain those keys without
affecting their initial insertion order.

This example contains a user-defined `hexMap()` function that maps
decimal
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
keys to
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
representations of their
[hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Hexadecimal) forms. The
script uses this function to create two maps, `mapA` and `mapB`, then
uses
[mapA.put_all(mapB)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put_all)
to put all key-value pairs from `mapB` into `mapA`.

The script uses a custom `debugLabel()` function to display labels
showing the
[keys](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys)
and
[values](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.values)
of `mapA` and `mapB`, then another label displaying the contents of
`mapA` after putting all key-value pairs from `mapB` into it:

hex(int value) =>
    //@variable A string representing the hex form of the `value`.
    string result = ""
    //@variable A temporary value for digit calculation.
    int tempValue = value  
    while tempValue > 0
        //@variable The next integer digit.
        int digit = tempValue % 16
        // Add the hex form of the `digit` to the `result`.
        result := hexDigits.get(digit) + result
        // Divide the `tempValue` by the base.
        tempValue := int(tempValue / 16)
    result

//@function Returns a map holding the `numbers` as keys and their `hex` strings as values.

    for number in numbers
        // Put a pair containing the `number` and its `hex()` representation into the `result`.
        result.put(number, hex(number))
    result

//@function Returns a label to display the keys and values of a hex map.
debugLabel(
     map<int, string> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue, 
     string style = label.style_label_center, string note = ""
 ) =>
    string repr = str.format(
         "{0}\nDecimal: {1}\nHex: {2}", 
         note, str.tostring(this.keys()), str.tostring(this.values())
     )
    label.new(
         barIndex, 0, repr, color = bgColor, style = style,
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
     )

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    //@variable A map with decimal `int` keys and hexadecimal `string` values.
    map<int, string> mapA = hexMap(array.from(101, 202, 303, 404))
    debugLabel(mapA, bar_index, color.navy, label.style_label_down, "A")

    //@variable A map containing key-value pairs to add to `mapA`.
    map<int, string> mapB = hexMap(array.from(303, 404, 505, 606, 707, 808))
    debugLabel(mapB, bar_index, color.maroon, label.style_label_up, "B")

    // Put all pairs from `mapB` into `mapA`.
    mapA.put_all(mapB)
    debugLabel(mapA, bar_index + 10, color.purple, note = "Merge B into A")
```

## [Looping through a map](https://www.tradingview.com#looping-through-a-map)

There are several ways scripts can iteratively access the keys and
values in a map. For example, one could loop through a map's
[keys()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.keys)
array and
[get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.get)
the value for each `key`, like so:

```
for key in thisMap.keys()
    value = thisMap.get(key)
```

However, we recommend using a `for...in` loop directly on a map, as it
iterates over the map's key-value pairs in their insertion order,
returning a tuple containing the next pair's key and value on each
iteration.

For example, this line of code loops through each `key` and `value` in
`thisMap`, starting from the first key-value pair put into it:

```
for [key, value] in thisMap
```

Let's use this structure to write a script that displays a map's
key-value pairs in a
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table).
In the example below, we've defined a custom `toTable()` method that
creates a
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table),
then uses a `for...in` loop to iterate over the map's key-value pairs
and populate the table's cells. The script uses this method to
visualize a map containing `length`-bar `averages` of price and volume
data:

![image](images/Maps-Looping-through-a-map-1.CTALDkOv_261pAn.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Looping through a map demo", "Table of averages")

//@variable The length of the moving average.
int length = input.int(20, "Length")
//@variable The size of the table text.
string txtSize = input.string(
     size.huge, "Text size",
     options = [size.auto, size.tiny, size.small, size.normal, size.large, size.huge]
 )

//@function Displays the pairs of `this` map within a table.
//@param    this A map with `string` keys and `float` values.
//@param    position The position of the table on the chart.
//@param    header The string to display on the top row of the table.
//@param    textSize The size of the text in the table.
//@returns  A new `table` object with cells displaying each pair in `this`.
method toTable(
     map<string, float> this, string position = position.middle_center, string header = na,
     string textSize = size.huge
 ) =>
    // Color variables
    borderColor = #000000
    headerColor = color.rgb(1, 88, 80)
    pairColor   = color.maroon
    textColor   = color.white

    //@variable A table that displays the key-value pairs of `this` map.
    table result = table.new(
         position, this.size() + 1, 3, border_width = 2, border_color = borderColor
     )
    // Initialize top and side header cells.
    result.cell(1, 0, header, bgcolor = headerColor, text_color = textColor, text_size = textSize)
    result.merge_cells(1, 0, this.size(), 0)
    result.cell(0, 1, "Key", bgcolor = headerColor, text_color = textColor, text_size = textSize)
    result.cell(0, 2, "Value", bgcolor = headerColor, text_color = textColor, text_size = textSize)

    //@variable The column index of the table. Updates on each loop iteration.
    int col = 1

    // Loop over each `key` and `value` from `this` map in the insertion order.
    for [key, value] in this
        // Initialize a `key` cell in the `result` table on row 1.
        result.cell(
             col, 1, str.tostring(key), bgcolor = color.maroon,
             text_color = color.white, text_size = textSize
         )
        // Initialize a `value` cell in the `result` table on row 2.
        result.cell(
             col, 2, str.tostring(value), bgcolor = color.maroon,
             text_color = color.white, text_size = textSize
         )
        // Move to the next column index.
        col += 1
    result // Return the `result` table.

//@variable A map with `string` keys and `float` values to hold `length`-bar averages.
averages = map.new<string, float>()

// Put key-value pairs into the `averages` map.
averages.put("Open", ta.sma(open, length))
averages.put("High", ta.sma(high, length))
averages.put("Low", ta.sma(low, length))
averages.put("Close", ta.sma(close, length))
averages.put("Volume", ta.sma(volume, length))

//@variable The text to display at the top of the table.
string headerText = str.format("{0} {1}-bar averages", "'" + syminfo.tickerid + "'", length)
// Display the `averages` map in a `table` with the `headerText`.
averages.toTable(header = headerText, textSize = txtSize)
```

## [Copying a map](https://www.tradingview.com#copying-a-map)

### [Shallow copies](https://www.tradingview.com#shallow-copies)

Scripts can make a *shallow copy* of a map `id` using the
[map.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.copy)
function. Modifications to a shallow copy do not affect the original
`id` map or its internal insertion order.

For example, this script constructs an `m` map with the keys "A",
"B", "C", and "D" assigned to four
[random](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random)
values between 0 and 10. It then creates an `mCopy` map as a shallow
copy of `m` and updates the values associated with its keys. The script
displays the key-value pairs in `m` and `mCopy` on the chart using our
custom `debugLabel()` method:

![image](images/Maps-Copying-a-map-Shallow-copies-1.e7-GYyqa_2eTTgn.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Shallow copy demo")

//@function Displays the key-value pairs of `this` map in a label. 
method debugLabel(
     map<string, float> this, int barIndex = bar_index, color bgColor = color.blue,
     color textColor = color.white, string note = ""
 ) =>
    //@variable The text to display in the label.
    labelText = note + "\n{"
    for [key, value] in this
        labelText += str.format("{0}: {1}, ", key, value)
    labelText := str.replace(labelText, ", ", "}", this.size() - 1)

    if barstate.ishistory
        label result = label.new(
             barIndex, 0, labelText, color = bgColor, style = label.style_label_center, 
             textcolor = textColor, size = size.huge
         )

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    //@variable A map of `string` keys and random `float` values.
    m = map.new<string, float>()

    // Assign random values to an array of keys in `m`.
    for key in array.from("A", "B", "C", "D")
        m.put(key, math.random(0, 10))

    //@variable A shallow copy of `m`.
    mCopy = m.copy()

    // Assign the insertion order value `i` to each `key` in `mCopy`.
    for [i, key] in mCopy.keys()
        mCopy.put(key, i)

    // Display the labels.
    m.debugLabel(bar_index, note = "Original")
    mCopy.debugLabel(bar_index + 10, color.purple, note = "Copied and changed")
```

### [Deep copies](https://www.tradingview.com#deep-copies)

While a [shallow copy](#shallow-copies) will suffice when copying maps that have values of a
[fundamental type](#types) or [enum type](#enum-types), it's crucial to understand that shallow copies of a map holding values of a *special type*
([line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label),
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table),
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
or a [UDT](#user-defined-types)) point to the same objects as the original. Modifying the
objects referenced by a shallow copy will affect the instances
referenced by the original map and vice versa.

To ensure changes to objects referenced by a copied map do not affect
instances referenced in other locations, one can make a *deep copy* by
creating a new map with key-value pairs containing copies of each value
in the original map.

This example creates an `original` map of
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
keys and
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
values and
[puts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
a key-value pair into it. The script copies the map to a `shallow`
variable via the built-in
[copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.copy)
method, then to a `deep` variable using a custom `deepCopy()` method.

As we see from the chart, changes to the label retrieved from the
`shallow` copy also affect the instance referenced by the `original`
map, but changes to the one from the `deep` copy do not:

![image](images/Maps-Copying-a-map-Deep-copies-1.DxdX2Bvp_23djFR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Deep copy demo")

//@function Returns a deep copy of `this` map.
method deepCopy(map<string, label> this) =>
    //@variable A deep copy of `this` map.
    result = map.new<string, label>()
    // Add key-value pairs with copies of each `value` to the `result`.
    for [key, value] in this
        result.put(key, value.copy())
    result //Return the `result`.

//@variable A map containing `string` keys and `label` values.
var original = map.new<string, label>()

if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    // Put a new key-value pair into the `original` map.
    map.put(
         original, "Test",
         label.new(bar_index, 0, "Original", textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge)
     )

    //@variable A shallow copy of the `original` map.
    map<string, label> shallow = original.copy()
    //@variable A deep copy of the `original` map.
    map<string, label> deep = original.deepCopy()

    //@variable The "Test" label from the `shallow` copy.
    label shallowLabel = shallow.get("Test")
    //@variable The "Test" label from the `deep` copy.
    label deepLabel = deep.get("Test")

    // Modify the "Test" label's `y` attribute in the `original` map.
    // This also affects the `shallowLabel`.
    original.get("Test").set_y(label.all.size())

    // Modify the `shallowLabel`. Also modifies the "Test" label in the `original` map.
    shallowLabel.set_text("Shallow copy")
    shallowLabel.set_color(color.red)
    shallowLabel.set_style(label.style_label_up)

    // Modify the `deepLabel`. Does not modify any other label instance.
    deepLabel.set_text("Deep copy")
    deepLabel.set_color(color.navy)
    deepLabel.set_style(label.style_label_left)
    deepLabel.set_x(bar_index + 5)
```

Note that:

- The `deepCopy()` method loops through the `original` map,
  copying each `value` and
  [putting](#putting-and-getting-key-value-pairs) key-value pairs containing the copies into a
  [new](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.new%3Ctype,type%3E)
  map instance.

## [Scope and history](https://www.tradingview.com#scope-and-history)

As with other collections in Pine, map variables leave historical trails
on each bar, allowing a script to access past map instances assigned to
a variable using the history-referencing operator
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D).
Scripts can also assign maps to global variables and interact with them
from the scopes of
[functions](#user-defined-functions),
[methods](#methods), and
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures).

As an example, this script uses a global map and its history to
calculate an aggregate set of
[EMAs](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592270/). It
declares a `globalData` map of
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
keys and
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
values, where each key in the map corresponds to the length of each EMA
calculation. The user-defined `update()` function calculates each
`key`-length EMA by mixing the values from the `previous` map assigned
to `globalData` with the current `source` value.

The script plots the
[maximum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.max)
and
[minimum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min)
values in the global map's
[values()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.values)
array and the value from `globalData.get(50)` (i.e., the 50-bar EMA):

![image](images/Maps-Scope-and-history-1.D57XNJl__ZkKAgd.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Scope and history demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The source value for EMA calculation.
float source = input.source(close, "Source")

//@variable A map containing global key-value pairs.
globalData = map.new<int, float>()

//@function Calculates a set of EMAs and updates the key-value pairs in `globalData`.
update() =>
    //@variable The previous map instance assigned to `globalData`.
    map<int, float> previous = globalData[1]

    // Put key-value pairs with keys 10-200 into `globalData` if `previous` is `na`.
    if na(previous)
        for i = 10 to 200
            globalData.put(i, source)
    else
        // Iterate each `key` and `value` in the `previous` map.
        for [key, value] in previous
            //@variable The smoothing parameter for the `key`-length EMA.
            float alpha = 2.0 / (key + 1.0)
            //@variable The `key`-length EMA value.
            float ema = (1.0 - alpha) * value + alpha * source
            // Put the `key`-length `ema` into the `globalData` map.
            globalData.put(key, ema)

// Update the `globalData` map.
update()

//@variable The array of values from `globalData` in their insertion order.
array<float> values = globalData.values()

// Plot the max EMA, min EMA, and 50-bar EMA values.
plot(values.max(), "Max EMA", color.green, 2)
plot(values.min(), "Min EMA", color.red, 2)
plot(globalData.get(50), "50-bar EMA", color.orange, 3)
```

## [Maps of other collections](https://www.tradingview.com#maps-of-other-collections)

Maps cannot directly use other maps,
[arrays](#arrays), or
[matrices](#matrices) as values, but
they can hold values of a
[user-defined type](#user-defined-types) that contains collections within its fields.

For example, suppose we want to create a "2D" map that uses
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
keys to access *nested maps* that hold pairs of
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
keys and
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
values. Since maps cannot use other collections as values, we will first
create a *wrapper type* with a field to hold a `map<string, float>`
instance, like so:

```
//@type A wrapper type for maps with `string` keys and `float` values.
type Wrapper
    map<string, float> data
```

With our `Wrapper` type defined, we can create maps of
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
keys and `Wrapper` values, where the `data` field of each value in the
map points to a `map<string, float>` instance:

```
mapOfMaps = map.new<string, Wrapper>()
```

The script below uses this concept to construct a map containing maps
that hold OHLCV data requested from multiple tickers. The user-defined
`requestData()` function requests price and volume data from a ticker,
creates a `<string, float>` map,
[puts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
the data into it, then returns a `Wrapper` instance containing the new
map.

The script
[puts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
the results from each call to `requestData()` into the `mapOfMaps`, then
creates a
[string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
representation of the nested maps with a user-defined `toString()`
method, which it displays on the chart in a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label):

![image](images/Maps-Maps-of-other-collections-1.DtwJ2MOI_Z172Q8n.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Nested map demo")

//@variable The timeframe of the requested data.
string tf = input.timeframe("D", "Timeframe")
// Symbol inputs.
string symbol1 = input.symbol("EURUSD", "Symbol 1")
string symbol2 = input.symbol("GBPUSD", "Symbol 2")
string symbol3 = input.symbol("EURGBP", "Symbol 3")

//@type A wrapper type for maps with `string` keys and `float` values.
type Wrapper
    map<string, float> data

//@function Returns a wrapped map containing OHLCV data from the `tickerID` at the `timeframe`.
requestData(string tickerID, string timeframe) =>
    // Request a tuple of OHLCV values from the specified ticker and timeframe.
    [o, h, l, c, v] = request.security(
         tickerID, timeframe,
         [open, high, low, close, volume]
     )
    //@variable A map containing requested OHLCV data.
    result = map.new<string, float>()
    // Put key-value pairs into the `result`.
    result.put("Open", o)
    result.put("High", h)
    result.put("Low", l)
    result.put("Close", c)
    result.put("Volume", v)
    //Return the wrapped `result`.
    Wrapper.new(result)

//@function Returns a string representing `this` map of `string` keys and `Wrapper` values.
method toString(map<string, Wrapper> this) =>
    //@variable A string representation of `this` map.
    string result = "{"

    // Iterate over each `key1` and associated `wrapper` in `this`.
    for [key1, wrapper] in this
        // Add `key1` to the `result`.
        result += key1

        //@variable A string representation of the `wrapper.data` map.
        string innerStr = ": {"
        // Iterate over each `key2` and associated `value` in the wrapped map.
        for [key2, value] in wrapper.data
            // Add the key-value pair's representation to `innerStr`.
            innerStr += str.format("{0}: {1}, ", key2, str.tostring(value))

        // Replace the end of `innerStr` with "}" and add to `result`.
        result += str.replace(innerStr, ", ", "},\n", wrapper.data.size() - 1)

    // Replace the blank line at the end of `result` with "}".
    result := str.replace(result, ",\n", "}", this.size() - 1)
    result

//@variable A map of wrapped maps containing OHLCV data from multiple tickers.
var mapOfMaps = map.new<string, Wrapper>()

//@variable A label showing the contents of the `mapOfMaps`.
var debugLabel = label.new(
     bar_index, 0, color = color.navy, textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge,
     style = label.style_label_center, text_font_family = font.family_monospace
 )

// Put wrapped maps into `mapOfMaps`.
mapOfMaps.put(symbol1, requestData(symbol1, tf))
mapOfMaps.put(symbol2, requestData(symbol2, tf))
mapOfMaps.put(symbol3, requestData(symbol3, tf))

// Update the label.
debugLabel.set_text(mapOfMaps.toString())
debugLabel.set_x(bar_index)

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Alerts

# [Alerts](https://www.tradingview.com#alerts)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

TradingView alerts run 24x7 on our servers and do not require users to
be logged in to execute. Alerts are created from the charts user
interface (*UI*). You will find all the information necessary to
understand how alerts work and how to create them from the charts UI in
the Help Center's [About TradingView
alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000520149) page.

Some of the alert types available on TradingView (*generic alerts*,
*drawing alerts* and *script alerts* on order fill events) are created
from symbols or scripts loaded on the chart and do not require specific
coding. Any user can create these types of alerts from the charts UI.

Other types of alerts (*script alerts* triggering on *alert() function
calls*, and *alertcondition() alerts*) require specific Pine Script™
code to be present in a script to create an *alert event* before script
users can create alerts from them using the charts UI. Additionally,
while script users can create *script alerts* triggering on *order fill
events* from the charts UI on any strategy loaded on their chart,
Programmers can specify explicit order fill alert messages in their
script for each type of order filled by the broker emulator.

This page covers the different ways Pine Script™ programmers can code
their scripts to create alert events from which script users will in
turn be able to create alerts from the charts UI. We will cover:

- How to use the
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  function to *alert() function calls* in indicators or strategies,
  which can then be included in *script alerts* created from the
  charts UI.
- How to add custom alert messages to be included in *script alerts*
  triggering on the *order fill events* of strategies.
- How to use the
  [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
  function to generate, in indicators only, *alertcondition() events*
  which can then be used to create *alertcondition() alerts* from the
  charts UI.

Keep in mind that:

- No alert-related Pine Script™ code can create a running alert in the
  charts UI; it merely creates alert events which can then be used by
  script users to create running alerts from the charts UI.
- Alerts only trigger in the realtime bar. The operational scope of
  Pine Script™ code dealing with any type of alert is therefore
  restricted to realtime bars only.
- When an alert is created in the charts UI, TradingView saves a
  mirror image of the script and its inputs, along with the chart's
  main symbol and timeframe to run the alert on its servers.
  Subsequent changes to your script's inputs or the chart will thus
  not affect running alerts previously created from them. If you want
  any changes to your context to be reflected in a running alert's
  behavior, you will need to delete the alert and create a new one in
  the new context.

### [Background](https://www.tradingview.com#background)

The different methods Pine programmers can use today to create alert
events in their script are the result of successive enhancements
deployed throughout Pine Script™'s evolution. The
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
function, which works in indicators only, was the first feature allowing
Pine Script™ programmers to create alert events. Then came order fill
alerts for strategies, which trigger when the broker emulator creates
*order fill events*. *Order fill events* require no special code for
script users to create alerts on them, but by way of the `alert_message`
parameter for order-generating `strategy.*()` functions, programmers can
customize the message of alerts triggering on *order fill events* by
defining a distinct alert message for any number of order fulfillment
events.

The
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function is the most recent addition to Pine Script™. It more or less
supersedes
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition),
and when used in strategies, provides a useful complement to alerts on
*order fill events*.

### [Which type of alert is best?](https://www.tradingview.com#which-type-of-alert-is-best)

For Pine Script™ programmers, the
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function will generally be easier and more flexible to work with.
Contrary to
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition),
it allows for dynamic alert messages, works in both indicators and
strategies and the programmer decides on the frequency of
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
events.

While
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
calls can be generated on any logic programmable in Pine, including when
orders are **sent** to the broker emulator in strategies, they cannot be
coded to trigger when orders are **executed** (or *filled*) because
after orders are sent to the broker emulator, the emulator controls
their execution and does not report fill events back to the script
directly.

When a script user wants to generate an alert on a strategy's order
fill events, he must include those events when creating a *script alert*
on the strategy in the "Create Alert" dialog box. No special code is
required in scripts for users to be able to do this. The message sent
with order fill events can, however, be customized by programmers
through use of the `alert_message` parameter in order-generating
`strategy.*()` function calls. A combination of
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
calls and the use of custom `alert_message` arguments in
order-generating `strategy.*()` calls should allow programmers to
generate alert events on most conditions occurring in their script's
execution.

The
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
function remains in Pine Script™ for backward compatibility, but it can
also be used advantageously to generate distinct alerts available for
selection as individual items in the "Create Alert" dialog box's
"Condition" field.

## [Script alerts](https://www.tradingview.com#script-alerts)

When a script user creates a *script alert* using the "Create Alert"
dialog box, the events able to trigger the alert will vary depending on
whether the alert is created from an indicator or a strategy.

A *script alert* created from an **indicator** will trigger when:

- The indicator contains
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  calls.
- The code's logic allows a specific
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  call to execute.
- The frequency specified in the
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  call allows the alert to trigger.

A *script alert* created from a **strategy** can trigger on *alert()
function calls*, on *order fill events*, or both. The script user
creating an alert on a strategy decides which type of events he wishes
to include in his *script alert*. While users can create a *script
alert* on *order fill events* without the need for a strategy to include
special code, it must contain
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
calls for users to include *alert() function calls* in their *script
alert*.

### [`alert()` function events](https://www.tradingview.com#alert-function-events)

The
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function has the following signature:

```
alert(message, freq)
```

`message`

A "series string" representing the message text sent when the
alert triggers. Because this argument allows "series" values, it
can be generated at runtime and differ bar to bar, making it
dynamic.

`freq`

An "input string" specifying the triggering frequency of the
alert. Valid arguments are:

- `alert.freq_once_per_bar`: Only the first call per realtime bar
  triggers the alert (default value).
- `alert.freq_once_per_bar_close`: An alert is only triggered when
  the realtime bar closes and an
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  call is executed during that script iteration.
- `alert.freq_all`: All calls during the realtime bar trigger the
  alert.

The
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function can be used in both indicators and strategies. For an
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
call to trigger a *script alert* configured on *alert() function calls*,
the script's logic must allow the
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
call to execute, **and** the frequency determined by the `freq`
parameter must allow the alert to trigger.

Note that by default, strategies are recalculated at the bar's close,
so if the
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function with the frequency `alert.freq_all` or
`alert.freq_once_per_bar` is used in a strategy, then it will be called
no more often than once at the bar's close. In order to enable the
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function to be called during the bar construction process, you need to
enable the `calc_on_every_tick` option.

#### [Using all `alert()` calls](https://www.tradingview.com#using-all-alert-calls)

Let's look at an example where we detect crosses of the RSI centerline:

```
//@version=6
indicator("All `alert()` calls")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Trigger an alert on crosses.
if xUp
    alert("Go long (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))
else if xDn
    alert("Go short (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))

plotchar(xUp, "Go Long",  "▲", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Go Short", "▼", location.top,    color.red,  size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)
```

If a *script alert* is created from this script:

- When RSI crosses the centerline up, the *script alert* will trigger
  with the "Go long…" message. When RSI crosses the centerline
  down, the *script alert* will trigger with the "Go short…"
  message.
- Because no argument is specified for the `freq` parameter in the
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  call, the default value of `alert.freq_once_per_bar` will be used,
  so the alert will only trigger the first time each of the
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  calls is executed during the realtime bar.
- The message sent with the alert is composed of two parts: a constant
  string and then the result of the
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dtostring)
  call which will include the value of RSI at the moment where the
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  call is executed by the script. An alert message for a cross up
  would look like: "Go long (RSI is 53.41)".
- Because a *script alert* always triggers on any occurrence of a call
  to
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert),
  as long as the frequency used in the call allows for it, this
  particular script does not allow a script user to restrict his
  *script alert* to longs only, for example.

Note that:

- Contrary to an
  [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
  call which is always placed at column 0 (in the script's global
  scope), the
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  call is placed in the local scope of an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  branch so it only executes when our triggering condition is met. If
  an
  [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
  call was placed in the script's global scope at column 0, it would
  execute on all bars, which would likely not be the desired behavior.
- An
  [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
  could not accept the same string we use for our alert's message
  because of its use of the
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dtostring)
  call.
  [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
  messages must be constant strings.

Lastly, because
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
messages can be constructed dynamically at runtime, we could have used
the following code to generate our alert events:

```
// Trigger an alert on crosses.
if xUp or xDn
    firstPart = (xUp ? "Go long" : "Go short") + " (RSI is "
    alert(firstPart + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))
```

#### [Using selective `alert()` calls](https://www.tradingview.com#using-selective-alert-calls)

When users create a *script alert* on *alert() function calls*, the
alert will trigger on any call the script makes to the
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function, provided its frequency constraints are met. If you want to
allow your script's users to select which
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function call in your script will trigger a *script alert*, you will
need to provide them with the means to indicate their preference in your
script's inputs, and code the appropriate logic in your script. This
way, script users will be able to create multiple *script alerts* from a
single script, each behaving differently as per the choices made in the
script's inputs prior to creating the alert in the charts UI.

Suppose, for our next example, that we want to provide the option of
triggering alerts on only longs, only shorts, or both. You could code
your script like this:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Selective `alert()` calls")
detectLongsInput  = input.bool(true,  "Detect Longs")
detectShortsInput = input.bool(true,  "Detect Shorts")
repaintInput      = input.bool(false, "Allow Repainting")

r = ta.rsi(close, 20)
// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.
enterLong  = detectLongsInput  and xUp and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)
enterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)
// Trigger the alerts only when the compound condition is met.
if enterLong
    alert("Go long (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))
else if enterShort
    alert("Go short (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))

plotchar(enterLong,  "Go Long",  "▲", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(enterShort, "Go Short", "▼", location.top,    color.red,  size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)
```

Note how:

- We create a compound condition that is met only when the user's
  selection allows for an entry in that direction. A long entry on a
  crossover of the centerline only triggers the alert when long
  entries have been enabled in the script's Inputs.
- We offer the user to indicate his repainting preference. When he
  does not allow the calculations to repaint, we wait until the bar's
  confirmation to trigger the compound condition. This way, the alert
  and the marker only appear at the end of the realtime bar.
- If a user of this script wanted to create two distinct script alerts
  from this script, i.e., one triggering only on longs, and one only
  on shorts, then he would need to:
    - Select only "Detect Longs" in the inputs and create a first
      *script alert* on the script.
    - Select only "Detect Shorts" in the Inputs and create another
      *script alert* on the script.

#### [In strategies](https://www.tradingview.com#in-strategies)

[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function calls can be used in strategies also, with the provision that
strategies, by default, only execute on the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
of realtime bars. Unless `calc_on_every_tick = true` is used in the
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
declaration statement, all
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
calls will use the `alert.freq_once_per_bar_close` frequency, regardless
of the argument used for `freq`.

While *script alerts* on strategies will use *order fill events* to
trigger alerts when the broker emulator fills orders,
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
can be used advantageously to generate other alert events in strategies.

This strategy creates *alert() function calls* when RSI moves against
the trade for three consecutive bars:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Strategy with selective `alert()` calls")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Place orders on crosses.
if xUp
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
else if xDn
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)

// Trigger an alert when RSI diverges from our trade's direction.
divInLongTrade  = strategy.position_size > 0 and ta.falling(r, 3)
divInShortTrade = strategy.position_size < 0 and ta.rising( r, 3)
if divInLongTrade 
    alert("WARNING: Falling RSI", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
if divInShortTrade
    alert("WARNING: Rising RSI", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)

plotchar(xUp, "Go Long",  "▲", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Go Short", "▼", location.top,    color.red,  size = size.tiny)
plotchar(divInLongTrade,  "WARNING: Falling RSI", "•", location.top,    color.red,  size = size.tiny)
plotchar(divInShortTrade, "WARNING: Rising RSI",  "•", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)
```

If a user created a *script alert* from this strategy and included both
*order fill events* and *alert() function calls* in his alert, the alert
would trigger whenever an order is executed, or when one of the
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
calls was executed by the script on the realtime bar's closing
iteration, i.e., when
[barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disrealtime)
and
[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed)
are both true. The *alert() function events* in the script would only
trigger the alert when the realtime bar closes because
`alert.freq_once_per_bar_close` is the argument used for the `freq`
parameter in the
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
calls.

### [Order fill events](https://www.tradingview.com#order-fill-events)

When a *script alert* is created from an indicator, it can only trigger
on *alert() function calls*. However, when a *script alert* is created
from a strategy, the user can specify that *order fill events* also
trigger the *script alert*. An *order fill event* is any event generated
by the broker emulator which causes a simulated order to be executed. It
is the equivalent of a trade order being filled by a broker/exchange.
Orders are not necessarily executed when they are placed. In a strategy,
the execution of orders can only be detected indirectly and after the
fact, by analyzing changes in built-in variables such as
[strategy.opentrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades)
or
[strategy.position_size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy%7Bdot%7Dposition_size).
*Script alerts* configured on *order fill events* are thus useful in
that they allow the triggering of alerts at the precise moment of an
order's execution, before a script's logic can detect it.

Pine Script™ programmers can customize the alert message sent when
specific orders are executed. While this is not a pre-requisite for
*order fill events* to trigger, custom alert messages can be useful
because they allow custom syntax to be included with alerts in order to
route actual orders to a third-party execution engine, for example.
Specifying custom alert messages for specific *order fill events* is
done by means of the `alert_message` parameter in functions which can
generate orders:
[strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclose),
[strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dentry),
[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dexit)
and
[strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dorder).

The argument used for the `alert_message` parameter is a "series
string", so it can be constructed dynamically using any variable
available to the script, as long as it is converted to string format.

Let's look at a strategy where we use the `alert_message` parameter in
both our
[strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dentry)
calls:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Strategy using `alert_message`")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Place order on crosses using a custom alert message for each.
if xUp
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, stop = high, alert_message = "Stop-buy executed (stop was " + str.tostring(high) + ")")
else if xDn
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short, stop = low, alert_message = "Stop-sell executed (stop was " + str.tostring(low) + ")")

plotchar(xUp, "Go Long",  "▲", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Go Short", "▼", location.top,    color.red,  size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)
```

Note that:

- We use the `stop` parameter in our
  [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dentry)
  calls, which creates stop-buy and stop-sell orders. This entails
  that buy orders will only execute once price is higher than the
  `high` on the bar where the order is placed, and sell orders will
  only execute once price is lower than the [low] on the
  bar where the order is placed.
- The up/down arrows which we plot with
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  are plotted when orders are **placed**. Any number of bars may
  elapse before the order is actually executed, and in some cases the
  order will never be executed because price does not meet the
  required condition.
- Because we use the same `id` argument for all buy orders, any new
  buy order placed before a previous order's condition is met will
  replace that order. The same applies to sell orders.
- Variables included in the `alert_message` argument are evaluated
  when the order is executed, so when the alert triggers.

When the `alert_message` parameter is used in a strategy's
order-generating `strategy.*()` function calls, script users must
include the `{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` placeholder in the
"Create Alert" dialog box's "Message" field when creating *script
alerts* on *order fill events*. This is required so the `alert_message`
argument used in the order-generating `strategy.*()` function calls is
used in the message of alerts triggering on each *order fill event*.
When only using the `{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` placeholder in
the "Message" field and the `alert_message` parameter is present in
only some of the order-generating `strategy.*()` function calls in your
strategy, an empty string will replace the placeholder in the message of
alerts triggered by any order-generating `strategy.*()` function call
not using the `alert_message` parameter.

While other placeholders can be used in the "Create Alert" dialog
box's "Message" field by users creating alerts on *order fill
events*, they cannot be used in the argument of `alert_message`.

## [`alertcondition()` events](https://www.tradingview.com#alertcondition-events)

The
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
function allows programmers to create individual *alertcondition events*
in their indicators. One indicator may contain more than one
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
call. Each call to
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
in a script will create a corresponding alert selectable in the
"Condition" dropdown menu of the "Create Alert" dialog box.

While the presence of
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
calls in a **strategy** script will not cause a compilation error,
alerts cannot be created from them.

The
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
function has the following signature:

```
alertcondition(condition, title, message)
```

`condition`

A "series bool" value (`true` or `false`) which determines when
the alert will trigger. It is a required argument. When the value is
`true` the alert will trigger. When the value is `false` the alert
will not trigger. Contrary to
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
function calls,
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
calls must start at column zero of a line, so cannot be placed in
conditional blocks.

`title`

A "const string" optional argument that sets the name of the alert
condition as it will appear in the "Create Alert" dialog box's
"Condition" field in the charts UI. If no argument is supplied,
"Alert" will be used.

`message`

A "const string" optional argument that specifies the text message
to display when the alert triggers. The text will appear in the
"Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box, from where
script users can then modify it when creating an alert. **As this
argument must be a "const string", it must be known at compilation
time and thus cannot vary bar to bar.** It can, however, contain
placeholders which will be replaced at runtime by dynamic values
that may change bar to bar. See this page's
[Placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com#placeholders) section for a list.

The
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
function does not include a `freq` parameter. The frequency of
*alertcondition() alerts* is determined by users in the "Create Alert"
dialog box.

### [Using one condition](https://www.tradingview.com#using-one-condition)

Here is an example of code creating *alertcondition() events*:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`alertcondition()` on single condition")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)

plot(r, "RSI")
hline(50)
plotchar(xUp, "Long",  "▲", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Short", "▼", location.top,    color.red,  size = size.tiny)

alertcondition(xUp, "Long Alert",  "Go long")
alertcondition(xDn, "Short Alert", "Go short ")
```

Because we have two
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
calls in our script, two different alerts will be available in the
"Create Alert" dialog box's "Condition" field: "Long Alert" and
"Short Alert".

If we wanted to include the value of RSI when the cross occurs, we could
not simply add its value to the `message` string using
`str.tostring(r)`, as we could in an
[alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert)
call or in an `alert_message` argument in a strategy. We can, however,
include it using a placeholder. This shows two alternatives:

```
alertcondition(xUp, "Long Alert",  "Go long. RSI is {{plot_0}}")
alertcondition(xDn, "Short Alert", 'Go short. RSI is {{plot("RSI")}}')
```

Note that:

- The first line uses the `{{plot_0}}` placeholder, where the plot
  number corresponds to the order of the plot in the script.
- The second line uses the `{{plot("[plot_title]")}}` type of
  placeholder, which must include the `title` of the
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  call used in our script to plot RSI. Double quotes are used to wrap
  the plot's title inside the `{{plot("RSI")}}` placeholder. This
  requires that we use single quotes to wrap the `message` string.
- Using one of these methods, we can include any numeric value that is
  plotted by our indicator, but as strings cannot be plotted, no
  string variable can be used.

### [Using compound conditions](https://www.tradingview.com#using-compound-conditions)

If we want to offer script users the possiblity of creating a single
alert from an indicator using multiple
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
calls, we will need to provide options in the script's inputs through
which users will indicate the conditions they want to trigger their
alert before creating it.

This script demonstrates one way to do it:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`alertcondition()` on multiple conditions")
detectLongsInput  = input.bool(true, "Detect Longs")
detectShortsInput = input.bool(true, "Detect Shorts")

r = ta.rsi(close, 20)
// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover( r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.
enterLong  = detectLongsInput  and xUp
enterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn

plot(r)
plotchar(enterLong,  "Go Long",  "▲", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(enterShort, "Go Short", "▼", location.top,    color.red,  size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
// Trigger the alert when one of the conditions is met.
alertcondition(enterLong or enterShort, "Compound alert", "Entry")
```

Note how the
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
call is allowed to trigger on one of two conditions. Each condition can
only trigger the alert if the user enables it in the script's inputs
before creating the alert.

### [Placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com#placeholders)

These placeholders can be used in the `message` argument of
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
calls. They will be replaced with dynamic values when the alert
triggers. They are the only way to include dynamic values (values that
can vary bar to bar) in
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
messages.

Note that users creating *alertcondition() alerts* from the "Create
Alert" dialog box in the charts UI are also able to use these
placeholders in the dialog box's "Message" field.

`{{exchange}}`

Exchange of the symbol used in the alert (NASDAQ, NYSE, MOEX, etc.).
Note that for delayed symbols, the exchange will end with "_DL" or
"_DLY." For example, "NYMEX_DL."

`{{interval}}`

Returns the timeframe of the chart the alert is created on. Note
that Range charts are calculated based on 1m data, so the
placeholder will always return "1" on any alert created on a Range
chart.

`{{open}}`, `{{high}}`, `{{low}}`, `{{close}}`, `{{volume}}`

Corresponding values of the bar on which the alert has been
triggered.

`{{plot_0}}`, `{{plot_1}}`, […], `{{plot_19}}`

Value of the corresponding plot number. Plots are numbered from zero
to 19 in order of appearance in the script, so only one of the first
20 plots can be used. For example, the built-in "Volume" indicator
has two output series: Volume and Volume MA, so you could use the
following:

```
alertcondition(volume > ta.sma(volume,20), "Volume alert", "Volume ({{plot_0}}) > average ({{plot_1}})")
```

`{{plot("[plot_title]")}}`

This placeholder can be used when one needs to refer to a plot using
the `title` argument used in a
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
call. Note that double quotation marks (`"`) **must** be used inside
the placeholder to wrap the `title` argument. This requires that a
single quotation mark (`'`) be used to wrap the `message` string:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
r = ta.rsi(close, 14)
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
plot(r, "RSI", display = display.none)
alertcondition(xUp, "xUp alert", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot("RSI")}}')
```

`{{ticker}}`

Ticker of the symbol used in the alert (AAPL, BTCUSD, etc.).

`{{time}}`

Returns the time at the beginning of the bar. Time is UTC, formatted
as `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`, so for example: `2019-08-27T09:56:00Z`.

`{{timenow}}`

Current time when the alert triggers, formatted in the same way as
`{{time}}`. The precision is to the nearest second, regardless of
the chart's timeframe.

## [Avoiding repainting with alerts](https://www.tradingview.com#avoiding-repainting-with-alerts)

The most common instances of repainting traders want to avoid with
alerts are ones where they must prevent an alert from triggering at some
point during the realtime bar when it would **not** have triggered at
its close. This can happen when these conditions are met:

- The calculations used in the condition triggering the alert can vary
  during the realtime bar. This will be the case with any calculation
  using `high`, `low` or `close`, for example, which includes almost
  all built-in indicators. It will also be the case with the result of
  any
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
  call using a higher timeframe than the chart's, when the higher
  timeframe's current bar has not closed yet.
- The alert can trigger before the close of the realtime bar, so with
  any frequency other than "Once Per Bar Close".

The simplest way to avoid this type of repainting is to configure the
triggering frequency of alerts so they only trigger on the close of the
realtime bar. There is no panacea; avoiding this type of repainting
**always** entails waiting for confirmed information, which means the
trader must sacrifice immediacy to achieve reliability.

Note that other types of repainting such as those documented in our
[Repainting](#repainting) section may
not be preventable by simply triggering alerts on the close of realtime
bars.

#### Backgrounds](#backgrounds)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Backgrounds

# [Backgrounds](https://www.tradingview.com#backgrounds)

The
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
function changes the color of the script's background. If the script is
running in `overlay = true` mode, then it will color the chart's
background.

The function's signature is:

```
bgcolor(color, offset, editable, show_last, title, force_overlay) → void
```

Its `color` parameter allows a "series color" to be used for its
argument, so it can be dynamically calculated in an expression.

If the correct transparency is not part of the color to be used, it can
be be generated using the
[color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dnew)
function.

Here is a script that colors the background of trading sessions (try it
on 30min EURUSD, for example):

```
//@version=6
indicator("Session backgrounds", overlay = true)

// Default color constants using tranparency of 25.
BLUE_COLOR   = #0050FF40
PURPLE_COLOR = #0000FF40
PINK_COLOR   = #5000FF40
NO_COLOR     = color(na)

// Allow user to change the colors.
preMarketColor  = input.color(BLUE_COLOR, "Pre-market")
regSessionColor = input.color(PURPLE_COLOR, "Pre-market")
postMarketColor = input.color(PINK_COLOR, "Pre-market")

// Function returns `true` when the bar's time is 
timeInRange(tf, session) => 
    time(tf, session) != 0

// Function prints a message at the bottom-right of the chart.
f_print(_text) => 
    var table _t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell(_t, 0, 0, _text, bgcolor = color.yellow)

var chartIs30MinOrLess = timeframe.isseconds or (timeframe.isintraday and timeframe.multiplier <=30)
sessionColor = if chartIs30MinOrLess
    switch
        timeInRange(timeframe.period, "0400-0930") => preMarketColor
        timeInRange(timeframe.period, "0930-1600") => regSessionColor
        timeInRange(timeframe.period, "1600-2000") => postMarketColor
        => NO_COLOR
else
    f_print("No background is displayed.\nChart timeframe must be <= 30min.")
    NO_COLOR

bgcolor(sessionColor)
```

![image](images/Backgrounds-Sessions.CXTYPY8S_22dX0.png)

Note that:

- The script only works on chart timeframes of 30min or less. It
  prints an error message when the chart's timeframe is higher than
  30min.
- When the
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  structure's `else` branch is used because the chart's timeframe is
  incorrect, the local block returns the `NO_COLOR` color so that no
  background is displayed in that case.
- We first initialize constants using our base colors, which include
  the `40` transparency in hex notation at the end. 40 in the
  hexadecimal notation on the reversed 00-FF scale for transparency
  corresponds to 75 in Pine Script™'s 0-100 decimal scale for
  transparency.
- We provide color inputs allowing script users to change the default
  colors we propose.

In our next example, we generate a gradient for the background of a CCI
line:

```
//@version=6
indicator("CCI Background")

bullColor = input.color(color.lime, "🠅", inline = "1")
bearColor = input.color(color.fuchsia, "🠇", inline = "1")

// Calculate CCI.
myCCI = ta.cci(hlc3, 20)
// Get relative position of CCI in last 100 bars, on a 0-100% scale.
myCCIPosition = ta.percentrank(myCCI, 100)
// Generate a bull gradient when position is 50-100%, bear gradient when position is 0-50%.
backgroundColor = if myCCIPosition >= 50
    color.from_gradient(myCCIPosition, 50, 100, color.new(bullColor, 75), bullColor)
else
    color.from_gradient(myCCIPosition, 0, 50, bearColor, color.new(bearColor, 75))

// Wider white line background.
plot(myCCI, "CCI", color.white, 3)
// Think black line.
plot(myCCI, "CCI", color.black, 1)
// Zero level.
hline(0)
// Gradient background.
bgcolor(backgroundColor)
```

![image](images/Backgrounds-CCI.D0GF9YXt_ZtOoQo.png)

Note that:

- We use the
  [ta.cci()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dcci)
  built-in function to calculate the indicator value.
- We use the
  [ta.percentrank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#ta.percentrank)
  built-in function to calculate `myCCIPosition`, i.e., the percentage
  of past `myCCI` values in the last 100 bars that are below the
  current value of `myCCI`.
- To calculate the gradient, we use two different calls of the
  [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient)
  built-in: one for the bull gradient when `myCCIPosition` is in the
  50-100% range, which means that more past values are below its
  current value, and another for the bear gradient when
  `myCCIPosition` is in the 0-49.99% range, which means that more past
  values are above it.
- We provide inputs so the user can change the bull/bear colors, and
  we place both color input widgets on the same line using
  `inline = "1"` in both
  [input.color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dcolor)
  calls.
- We plot the CCI signal using two
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  calls to achieve the best contrast over the busy background: the
  first plot is a 3-pixel wide white background, the second
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  call plots the thin, 1-pixel wide black line.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Bar coloring

# [Bar coloring](https://www.tradingview.com#bar-coloring)

The [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor) function colors bars on the main chart, regardless of whether the script is running in the main chart pane or a separate pane.

The function's signature is:

```
barcolor(color, offset, editable, show_last, title, display) → void
```

The coloring can be conditional because the `color` parameter accepts "series color" arguments.

The following script renders *inside* and *outside* bars in different colors:

![image](images/BarColoring-1.BVBRLjUu_2gjXX.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("barcolor example", overlay = true)
isUp = close > open
isDown = close <= open
isOutsideUp = high > high[1] and low < low[1] and isUp
isOutsideDown = high > high[1] and low < low[1] and isDown
isInside = high < high[1] and low > low[1]
barcolor(isInside ? color.yellow : isOutsideUp ? color.aqua : isOutsideDown ? color.purple : na)
```

Note that:

- The [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value leaves bars as is.
- In the [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor) call, we use embedded [?:](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%7Bquestion%7D%7Bcolon%7D) ternary operator expressions to select the color.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Bar plotting

# [Bar plotting](https://www.tradingview.com#bar-plotting)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

The
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
built-in function is used to plot candles.
[plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar)
is used to plot conventional bars.

Both functions require four arguments that will be used for the OHLC
prices
([open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low),
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close))
of the bars they will be plotting. If one of those is
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), no
bar is plotted.

## [Plotting candles with `plotcandle()`](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting-candles-with-plotcandle)

The signature of
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
is:

```
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, title, color, wickcolor, editable, show_last, bordercolor, display) → void
```

This plots simple candles, all in blue, using the habitual OHLC values,
in a separate pane:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Single-color candles")
plotcandle(open, high, low, close)
```

![image](images/BarPlotting-Plotcandle-1.DRLnC2kq_Z1j0wjf.png)

To color them green or red, we can use the following code:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 2")
paletteColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = paletteColor)
```

![image](images/BarPlotting-Plotcandle-2.CJRFcfps_Z1tzvoP.png)

Note that the `color` parameter accepts "series color" arguments, so
constant values such as `color.red`, `color.lime`, `"#FF9090"`, as well
as expressions that calculate colors at runtime, as is done with the
`paletteColor` variable here, will all work.

You can build bars or candles using values other than the actual OHLC
values. For example you could calculate and plot smoothed candles using
the following code, which also colors wicks depending on the position of
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
relative to the smoothed close (`c`) of our indicator:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Smoothed candles", overlay = true)
lenInput = input.int(9)
smooth(source, length) =>
    ta.sma(source, length)
o = smooth(open, lenInput)
h = smooth(high, lenInput)
l = smooth(low, lenInput)
c = smooth(close, lenInput)
ourWickColor = close > c ? color.green : color.red
plotcandle(o, h, l, c, wickcolor = ourWickColor)
```

![image](images/BarPlotting-Plotcandle-3.C3UsErKE_Z1DDKH.png)

You may find it useful to plot OHLC values taken from a higher
timeframe. You can, for example, plot daily bars on an intraday chart:

```
// NOTE: Use this script on an intraday chart.
//@version=6
indicator("Daily bars", behind_chart = false, overlay = true)

// Use gaps to return data only when the 1D timeframe completes, and to return `na` otherwise.
[o, h, l, c] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", [open, high, low, close], gaps = barmerge.gaps_on)

const color UP_COLOR = color.silver
const color DN_COLOR = color.blue
color wickColor = c >= o ? UP_COLOR : DN_COLOR
color bodyColor = c >= o ? color.new(UP_COLOR, 70) : color.new(DN_COLOR, 70)
// Plot candles on intraday timeframes, 
// and when non `na` values are returned by `request.security()` because a HTF bar has completed.
plotcandle(timeframe.isintraday ? o : na, h, l, c, color = bodyColor, wickcolor = wickColor)
```

![image](images/BarPlotting-Plotcandle-4.BBez67E-_6Ng96.png)

Note that:

- We set the `behind_chart` parameter of the [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration to `false`. This causes our script's candles to appear on top of the chart's candles. Selecting "Visual Order/Bring to Front" from the script's "More" menu achieves the same result.
- The script displays candles only when two conditions are met:
    - The chart is using an intraday timeframe (see the check on `timeframe.isintraday` in the [plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle) call). We do this because it's not useful to show a daily value on timeframes higher or equal to 1D.
    - The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity) function returns non [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values (see `gaps = barmerge.gaps_on` in the function call).
- We use a tuple (`[open, high, low, close]`) with [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
  to fetch four values in one call.
- We create a lighter transparency for the body of our candles in the `bodyColor` variable initialization, so they don't obstruct the chart's candles.

## [Plotting bars with `plotbar()`](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting-bars-with-plotbar)

The signature of
[plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar)
is:

```
plotbar(open, high, low, close, title, color, editable, show_last, display, force_overlay) → void
```

Note that
[plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar)
has no parameter for `bordercolor` or `wickcolor`, as there are no
borders or wicks on conventional bars.

This plots conventional bars using the same coloring logic as in the
second example of the previous section:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Dual-color bars")
paletteColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = paletteColor)
```

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Bar states

# [Bar states](https://www.tradingview.com#bar-states)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

A set of built-in variables in the `barstate` namespace allow your
script to detect different properties of the bar on which the script is
currently executing.

These states can be used to restrict the execution or the logic of your
code to specific bars.

Some built-ins return information on the trading session the current bar
belongs to. They are explained in the
[Session states](#session-states) section.

## [Bar state built-in variables](https://www.tradingview.com#bar-state-built-in-variables)

Note that while indicators and libraries run on all price or volume
updates in real time, strategies not using `calc_on_every_tick` will
not; they will only execute when the realtime bar closes. This will
affect the detection of bar states in that type of script. On open
markets, for example, this code will not display a background until the
realtime closes because that is when the strategy runs:

```
//@version=6
strategy("S")
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? color.silver : na)
```

### [`barstate.isfirst`](https://www.tradingview.com#barstateisfirst)

[barstate.isfirst](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disfirst)
is only `true` on the dataset's first bar, i.e., when
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
is zero.

It can be useful to initialize variables on the first bar only, e.g.:

```
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
FILL_COLOR = color.green
var fillColors = array.new_color(0)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill color.
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))
```

### [`barstate.islast`](https://www.tradingview.com#barstateislast)

[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
is `true` if the current bar is the last one on the chart, whether that
bar is a realtime bar or not.

It can be used to restrict the execution of code to the chart's last
bar, which is often useful when drawing lines, labels or tables. Here,
we use it to determine when to update a label which we want to appear
only on the last bar. We create the label only once and then update its
properties using `label.set_*()` functions because it is more efficient:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
// Create label on the first bar only.
var label hiLabel = label.new(na, na, "")
// Update the label's position and text on the last bar,
// including on all realtime bar updates.
if barstate.islast
    label.set_xy(hiLabel, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(hiLabel, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
```

### [`barstate.ishistory`](https://www.tradingview.com#barstateishistory)

[barstate.ishistory](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dishistory)
is `true` on all historical bars. It can never be `true` on a bar when
[barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disrealtime)
is also `true`, and it does not become `true` on a realtime bar's
closing update, when
[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed)
becomes `true`. On closed markets, it can be `true` on the same bar
where
[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
is also `true`.

### [`barstate.isrealtime`](https://www.tradingview.com#barstateisrealtime)

[barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disrealtime)
is `true` if the current data update is a real-time bar update, `false`
otherwise (thus it is historical). Note that
[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
is also `true` on all realtime bars.

### [`barstate.isnew`](https://www.tradingview.com#barstateisnew)

[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew)
is `true` on all historical bars and on the realtime bar's first
(opening) update.

All historical bars are considered *new* bars because the Pine Script™
runtime executes your script on each bar sequentially, from the chart's
first bar in time, to the last. Each historical bar is thus *discovered*
by your script as it executes, bar to bar.

[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew)
can be useful to reset
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
variables when a new realtime bar comes in. The following code will
reset `updateNo` to 1 on all historical bars and at the beginning of
each realtime bar. It calculates the number of realtime updates during
each realtime bar:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
updateNo() => 
    varip int updateNo = na
    if barstate.isnew
        updateNo := 1
    else
        updateNo += 1
plot(updateNo())
```

### [`barstate.isconfirmed`](https://www.tradingview.com#barstateisconfirmed)

[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed)
is `true` on all historical bars and on the last (closing) update of a
realtime bar.

It can be useful to avoid repainting by requiring the realtime bar to be
closed before a condition can become `true`. We use it here to hold
plotting of our RSI until the realtime bar closes and becomes an elapsed
realtime bar. It will plot on historical bars because
[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed)
is always `true` on them:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
plot(barstate.isconfirmed ? myRSI : na)
```

[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed)
will not work when used in a
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
call.

### [`barstate.islastconfirmedhistory`](https://www.tradingview.com#barstateislastconfirmedhistory)

[barstate.islastconfirmedhistory](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislastconfirmedhistory)
is `true` if the script is executing on the dataset's last bar when the
market is closed, or on the bar immediately preceding the realtime bar
if the market is open.

It can be used to detect the first realtime bar with
`barstate.islastconfirmedhistory[1]`, or to postpone server-intensive
calculations until the last historical bar, which would otherwise be
undetectable on open markets.

## [Example](https://www.tradingview.com#example)

Here is an example of a script using `barstate.*` variables:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Bar States", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

stateText() =>
    string txt = ""
    txt += barstate.isfirst     ? "isfirst\n"     : ""
    txt += barstate.islast      ? "islast\n"      : ""
    txt += barstate.ishistory   ? "ishistory\n"   : ""
    txt += barstate.isrealtime  ? "isrealtime\n"  : ""
    txt += barstate.isnew       ? "isnew\n"       : ""
    txt += barstate.isconfirmed ? "isconfirmed\n" : ""
    txt += barstate.islastconfirmedhistory ? "islastconfirmedhistory\n" : ""

labelColor = switch
    barstate.isfirst                => color.fuchsia
    barstate.islastconfirmedhistory => color.gray
    barstate.ishistory              => color.silver
    barstate.isconfirmed            => color.orange
    barstate.isnew                  => color.red
    => color.yellow

label.new(bar_index, na, stateText(), yloc = yloc.abovebar, color = labelColor)
```

Note that:

- Each state's name will appear in the label's text when it is
  `true`.
- There are five possible colors for the label's background:
    - fuchsia on the first bar
    - silver on historical bars
    - gray on the last confirmed historical bar
    - orange when a realtime bar is confirmed (when it closes and
      becomes an elapsed realtime bar)
    - red on the realtime bar's first execution
    - yellow for other executions of the realtime bar

We begin by adding the indicator to the chart of an open market, but
before any realtime update is received. Note how the last confirmed
history bar is identified in #1, and how the last bar is identified as
the last one, but is still considered a historical bar because no
realtime updates have been received.

![image](images/BarStates-Example-01.C2adOFU8_1Hn1tm.png)

Let's look at what happens when realtime updates start coming in:

![image](images/BarStates-Example-02.B_WDB0Io_Z2snO6O.png)

Note that:

- The realtime bar is red because it is its first execution, because
  `barstate.isnew` is `true` and `barstate.ishistory` is no longer
  `true`, so our
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
  structure determing our color uses the `barstate.isnew => color.red`
  branch. This will usually not last long because on the next update
  `barstate.isnew` will no longer be `true` so the label's color will
  turn yellow.
- The label of elapsed realtime bars is orange because those bars were
  not historical bars when they closed. Accordingly, the
  `barstate.ishistory => color.silver` branch in the
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
  structure was not executed, but the next one,
  `barstate.isconfirmed => color.orange` was.

This last example shows how the realtime bar's label will turn yellow
after the first execution on the bar. This is the way the label will
usually appear on realtime bars:

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Chart information

# [Chart information](https://www.tradingview.com#chart-information)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

The way scripts can obtain information about the chart and symbol they
are currently running on is through a subset of Pine Script™'s
[built-in variables](#built-in-variables). The ones we cover here allow scripts to access information
relating to:

- The chart's prices and volume
- The chart's symbol
- The chart's timeframe
- The session (or time period) the symbol trades on

## [Prices and volume](https://www.tradingview.com#prices-and-volume)

The built-in variables for OHLCV values are:

- [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open):
  the bar's opening price.
- [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high):
  the bar's highest price, or the highest price reached during the
  realtime bar's elapsed time.
- [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low):
  the bar's lowest price, or the lowest price reached during the
  realtime bar's elapsed time.
- [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close):
  the bar's closing price, or the **current price** in the realtime
  bar.
- [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume):
  the volume traded during the bar, or the volume traded during the
  realtime bar's elapsed time. The unit of volume information varies
  with the instrument. It is in shares for stocks, in lots for forex,
  in contracts for futures, in the base currency for crypto, etc.

Other values are available through:

- [hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2):
  the average of the bar's
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
  and
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
  values.
- [hlc3](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlc3):
  the average of the bar's
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
  and
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  values.
- [ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4):
  the average of the bar's
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
  and
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  values.

On historical bars, the values of the above variables do not vary during
the bar because only OHLCV information is available on them. When
running on historical bars, scripts execute on the bar's
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
when all the bar's information is known and cannot change during the
script's execution on the bar.

Realtime bars are another story altogether. When indicators (or
strategies using `calc_on_every_tick = true`) run in realtime, the
values of the above variables (except
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open))
will vary between successive iterations of the script on the realtime
bar, because they represent their **current** value at one point in time
during the progress of the realtime bar. This may lead to one form of
[repainting](#repainting). See the
page on Pine Script™'s
[execution model](#execution-model) for
more details.

The
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)[history-referencing operator](#--history-referencing-operator) can be used to refer to past values of the built-in
variables, e.g., `close[1]` refers to the value of
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
on the previous bar, relative to the particular bar the script is
executing on.

## [Symbol information](https://www.tradingview.com#symbol-information)

Built-in variables in the `syminfo` namespace provide scripts with
information on the symbol of the chart the script is running on. This
information changes every time a script user changes the chart's
symbol. The script then re-executes on all the chart's bars using the
new values of the built-in variables:

- [syminfo.basecurrency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dbasecurrency):
  the base currency, e.g., "BTC" in "BTCUSD", or "EUR" in
  "EURUSD".
- [syminfo.currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dcurrency):
  the quote currency, e.g., "USD" in "BTCUSD", or "CAD" in
  "USDCAD".
- [syminfo.description](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Ddescription):
  The long description of the symbol.
- [syminfo.main_tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.main_tickerid): The symbol's *main* ticker identifier. It behaves almost identically to [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid), referencing the symbol's exchange prefix, name, and additional ticker data. However, this variable *always* represents the *current* chart's ticker ID, even within requested contexts.
- [syminfo.mincontract](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.mincontract): The symbol's smallest tradable amount, which is set by its exchange. For example, the minimum for NASDAQ asset "AAPL" is 1 token, while the minimum for BITSTAMP cryptocurrency "ETHUSD" is 0.0001 tokens.
- [syminfo.mintick](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dmintick):
  The symbol's tick value, or the minimum increment price can move
  in. Not to be confused with *pips* or *points*. On "ES1!" ("S&P
  500 E-Mini") the tick size is 0.25 because that is the minimal
  increment the price moves in.
- [syminfo.pointvalue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dpointvalue):
  The point value is the multiple of the underlying asset determining
  a contract's value. On "ES1!" ("S&P 500 E-Mini") the point
  value is 50, so a contract is worth 50 times the price of the
  instrument.
- [syminfo.prefix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dprefix):
  The prefix is the exchange or broker's identifier: "NASDAQ" or
  "BATS" for "AAPL", "CME_MINI_DL" for "ES1!".
- [syminfo.root](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Droot):
  It is the ticker's prefix for structured tickers like those of
  futures. It is "ES" for "ES1!", "ZW" for "ZW1!".
- [syminfo.session](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dsession):
  It reflects the session setting on the chart for that symbol. If the
  "Chart settings/Symbol/Session" field is set to "Extended", it
  will only return "extended" if the symbol and the user's feed
  allow for extended sessions. It is rarely displayed and used mostly
  as an argument to the `session` parameter in
  [ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dnew).
- [syminfo.ticker](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dticker):
  It is the symbol's name, without the exchange part
  ([syminfo.prefix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dprefix)):
  "BTCUSD", "AAPL", "ES1!", "USDCAD".
- [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid): The symbol's ticker identifier, consisting of its exchange prefix and symbol name, e.g., "NASDAQ:MSFT". It can also include ticker information beyond the "prefix:ticker" form, such as extended hours, dividend adjustments, currency conversion, etc. To retrieve the standard "prefix:ticker" form only, pass the variable to [ticker.standard()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.standard). When used in a `request.*()` call's `expression` argument, this variable references the *requested* context's ticker ID. Otherwise, it references the current chart's ticker ID.
- [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dtimezone):
  The timezone the symbol is traded in. The string is an [IANA time
  zone database
  name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
  (e.g., "America/New_York").
- [syminfo.type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dtype):
  The type of market the symbol belongs to. The values are "stock",
  "futures", "index", "forex", "crypto", "fund", "dr",
  "cfd", "bond", "warrant", "structured" and "right".

This script displays these built-in variables and their values for the current symbol in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.new) on the
chart:

![image](images/Chart-information-Symbol-information-1.CS2rX-rO_jQr2H.png)

    table.cell(t, 1, 0, txtRight, bgcolor = color.yellow, text_halign = text.align_left)
```

## [Chart timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com#chart-timeframe)

A script can obtain information on the type of timeframe used on the
chart using these built-ins, which all return a "simple bool" result:

- [timeframe.isseconds](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disseconds)
- [timeframe.isminutes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disminutes)
- [timeframe.isintraday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disintraday)
- [timeframe.isdaily](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disdaily)
- [timeframe.isweekly](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disweekly)
- [timeframe.ismonthly](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dismonthly)
- [timeframe.isdwm](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Disdwm)

Additional built-ins return more specific timeframe information:

- [timeframe.multiplier](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dmultiplier)
  returns a "simple int" containing the multiplier of the timeframe
  unit. A chart timeframe of one hour will return `60` because
  intraday timeframes are expressed in minutes. A 30sec timeframe will
  return `30` (seconds), a daily chart will return `1` (day), a
  quarterly chart will return `3` (months), and a yearly chart will
  return `12` (months). The value of this variable cannot be used as
  an argument to `timeframe` parameters in built-in functions, as they
  expect a string in timeframe specifications format.
- [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) holds a "string" representing the script's timeframe. It follows Pine's [timeframe string specifications](#timeframe-string-specifications), where the string consists of a quantity (multiplier) and unit, e.g., "1D", "2W", "3M". When used in a `request.*()` call's `expression` argument, this variable references the *requested* context's timeframe. Otherwise, it references the script's main timeframe.
- [timeframe.main_period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.main_period) holds a "string" representing the *main* timeframe, which is either the `timeframe` argument specified in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration, or the current chart's timeframe. It behaves almost identically to [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period). However, this variable *always* represents the script's *main* timeframe, even within requested contexts.

See the page on [Timeframes](#timeframes) for more information.

## [Session information](https://www.tradingview.com#session-information)

Session information is available in different forms:

- The
  [syminfo.session](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dsession)
  built-in variable returns a value that is either
  [session.regular](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_session%7Bdot%7Dregular)
  or
  [session.extended](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_session%7Bdot%7Dextended).
  It reflects the session setting on the chart for that symbol. If the
  "Chart settings/Symbol/Session" field is set to "Extended", it
  will only return "extended" if the symbol and the user's feed
  allow for extended sessions. It is used when a session type is
  expected, for example as the argument for the `session` parameter in
  [ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dnew).
- [Session state built-ins](#session-states) provide information on the trading session a bar belongs
  to.

# [Colors](https://www.tradingview.com#colors)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Script visuals can play a critical role in the usability of the indicators we write in Pine Script™. Well-designed plots and drawings make indicators easier to use and understand. Good visual designs establish a visual hierarchy that allows the more important information to stand out, and the less important one to not get in the way.

Using colors in Pine can be as simple as you want, or as involved as your concept requires. The 4,294,967,296 possible assemblies of color and transparency available in Pine Script™ can be applied to:

- Any element you can plot or draw in an indicator's visual space, be
  it lines, fills, text or candles.
- The background of a script's visual space, whether the script is
  running in its own pane, or in overlay mode on the chart.
- The color of bars or the body of candles appearing on a chart.

A script can only color the elements it places in its own visual space. The only exception to this rule is that a pane indicator can color chart bars or candles.

Pine Script™ has built-in colors such as [color.green](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color%7Bdot%7Dgreen), as well as functions like [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Drgb) which allow you to dynamically generate any color in the RGBA color space.

### [Transparency](https://www.tradingview.com#transparency)

Each color in Pine Script™ is defined by four values:

- Its red, green and blue components (0-255), following the [RGB color
  model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space).
- Its transparency (0-100), often referred to as the Alpha channel
  outside Pine, as defined in the [RGBA color
  model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_model). Even though
  transparency is expressed in the 0-100 range, its value can be a
  "float" when used in functions, which gives you access to the 256
  underlying values of the alpha channel.

The transparency of a color defines how opaque it is: zero is fully opaque, 100 makes the color — whichever it is — invisible. Modulating transparency can be crucial in more involved color visuals or when using backgrounds, to control which colors dominate the others, and how they mix together when superimposed.

### [Z-index](https://www.tradingview.com#z-index)

When you place elements in a script's visual space, they have relative depth on the *z* axis; some will appear on top of others. The *z-index* is a value that represents the position of elements on the *z* axis. Elements with the highest z-index appear on top.

Elements drawn in Pine Script™ are divided in groups. Each group has its own position in the *z* space, and **within the same group**, elements created last in the script's logic will appear on top of other elements from the same group. An element of one group cannot be placed outside the region of the *z* space attributed to its group, so a plot can never appear on top of a table, for example, because tables have the highest z-index.

This list contains the groups of visual elements, ordered by increasing z-index, so background colors are always at the bottom of *z* space, and tables will always appear on top of all other elements:

- Background colors
- Fills
- Plots
- Hlines
- LineFills
- Lines
- Boxes
- Labels
- Tables

Note that by using `explicit_plot_zorder = true` in [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), you can control the relative z-index of `plot*()`, [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline) and [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill) visuals using their sequential order in the script.

## [Constant colors](https://www.tradingview.com#constant-colors)

There are 17 built-in colors in Pine Script™. This table lists their names, hexadecimal equivalent, and RGB values as arguments to [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Drgb):

NameHexRGB valuescolor.aqua#00BCD4color.rgb(0, 188, 212)color.black#363A45color.rgb(54, 58, 69)color.blue#2196F3color.rgb(33, 150, 243)color.fuchsia#E040FBcolor.rgb(224, 64, 251)color.gray#787B86color.rgb(120, 123, 134)color.green#4CAF50color.rgb(76, 175, 80)color.lime#00E676color.rgb(0, 230, 118)color.maroon#880E4Fcolor.rgb(136, 14, 79)color.navy#311B92color.rgb(49, 27, 146)color.olive#808000color.rgb(128, 128, 0)color.orange#FF9800color.rgb(255, 152, 0)color.purple#9C27B0color.rgb(156, 39, 176)color.red#F23645color.rgb(242, 54, 69)color.silver#B2B5BEcolor.rgb(178, 181, 190)color.teal#089981color.rgb(8, 153, 129)color.white#FFFFFFcolor.rgb(255, 255, 255)color.yellow#FDD835color.rgb(253, 216, 53)The following script shows three different ways to express [color.olive](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color%7Bdot%7Dolive) with 40% transparency. All three methods are functionally equivalent:

![image](images/Colors-Constant-colors-1.CnlC-u-k_1ibe2x.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Constant colors demo", overlay = true)

// Create a plot using the hex color code equivalent for `color.olive` with `99` as the alpha value (60% opacity).
plot(ta.sma(close, 10), "10-bar SMA", #80800099, 3)
// Create a plot using `color.new()` to modify `color.olive` with 40% transparency.
plot(ta.sma(close, 30), "30-bar SMA", color.new(color.olive, 40), 3)
// Create a plot using `color.rgb()` with the `r`, `g`, and `b` components of `color.olive` and 40% transparency.
plot(ta.sma(close, 50), "50-bar SMA", color.rgb(128, 128, 0, 40), 3)
```

Note that:

- An alpha value of `99` in a hexadecimal color code is equivalent to 60% opacity, meaning the resulting color is 40% transparent.
- Transparency does *not* affect plot outputs in the status line, price scale, or Data Window. All these locations show the color with 0% transparency.

The colors in the previous script do not vary as the script executes bar to bar. Sometimes, however, colors need to be created as the script executes on each bar because they depend on conditions that are unknown at compile time, or when the script begins execution on bar zero. For those cases, programmers have two options:

1. Use conditional statements to select colors from a few
   pre-determined base colors.
2. Build new colors dynamically, by calculating them as the script
   executes bar to bar, to implement color gradients, for example.

## [Conditional coloring](https://www.tradingview.com#conditional-coloring)

Let's say you want to color a moving average in different colors, depending on some conditions you define. To do so, you can use a conditional statement that will select a different color for each of your states. Let's start by coloring a moving average in a bull color when it's rising, and in a bear color when it's not:

![image](images/Colors-ConditionalColors-1.D1QaF3Y-_ZumNWi.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional colors", "", true)
int   lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 2)
color maBullColorInput = input.color(color.green, "Bull")
color maBearColorInput = input.color(color.maroon, "Bear")
float ma = ta.sma(close, lengthInput)
// Define our states.
bool maRising  = ta.rising(ma, 1)
// Build our color.
color c_ma = maRising ? maBullColorInput : maBearColorInput
plot(ma, "MA", c_ma, 2)
```

Note that:

- We provide users of our script a selection of colors for our
  bull/bear colors.
- We define an `maRising` boolean variable which will hold `true` when
  the moving average is higher on the current bar than it was on the
  last.
- We define a `c_ma` color variable that is assigned one of our two
  colors, depending on the value of the `maRising` boolean. We use the
  [? : ternary
  operator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%7Bquestion%7D%7Bcolon%7D)
  to write our conditional statement.

You can also use conditional colors to avoid plotting under certain conditions. Here, we plot high and low pivots using a line, but we do not want to plot anything when a new pivot comes in, to avoid the joints that would otherwise appear in pivot transitions. To do so, we test for pivot changes and use [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) as the color value when a change is detected, so that no line is plotted on that bar:

![image](images/Colors-ConditionalColors-2.erY98c4P_Z1OwyIO.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional colors", "", true)
int legsInput = input.int(5, "Pivot Legs", minval = 1)
color pHiColorInput = input.color(color.olive, "High pivots")
color pLoColorInput = input.color(color.orange, "Low pivots")
// Intialize the pivot level variables.
var float pHi = na
var float pLo = na
// When a new pivot is detected, save its value.
pHi := nz(ta.pivothigh(legsInput, legsInput), pHi)
pLo := nz(ta.pivotlow( legsInput, legsInput), pLo)
// When a new pivot is detected, do not plot a color.
plot(pHi, "High", ta.change(pHi) != 0 ? na : pHiColorInput, 2, plot.style_line)
plot(pLo, "Low",  ta.change(pLo) != 0 ? na : pLoColorInput, 2, plot.style_line)
```

To undertand how this code works, one must first know that [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivothigh) and [ta.pivotlow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivotlow), used as they are here without an argument to the `source` parameter, will return a value when they find a [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)/[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) pivot, otherwise they return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

When we test the value returned by the pivot function for [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) using the [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) function, we allow the value returned to be assigned to the `pHi` or `pLo` variables only when it is not [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), otherwise the previous value of the variable is simply reassigned to it, which has no impact on its value. Keep in mind that previous values of `pHi` and `pLo` are preserved bar to bar because we use the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) keyword when initializing them, which causes the initialization to only occur on the first bar.

All that's left to do next is, when we plot our lines, to insert a ternary conditional statement that will yield [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) for the color when the pivot value changes, or the color selected in the script's inputs when the pivot level does not change.

## [Calculated colors](https://www.tradingview.com#calculated-colors)

Using functions like [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dnew), [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Drgb) and [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient), one can build colors on the fly, as the script executes bar to bar.

[color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dnew) is most useful when you need to generate different transparency levels from a base color.

[color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Drgb) is useful when you need to build colors dynamically from red, green, blue, or tranparency components. While [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Drgb) creates a color, its sister functions [color.r()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dr), [color.g()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dg), [color.b()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Db) and [color.t()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dt) can be used to extract the red, green, blue or transparency values from a color, which can in turn be used to generate a variant.

[color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient) is useful to create linear gradients between two base colors. It determines which intermediary color to use by evaluating a source value against minimum and maximum values.

### [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com#colornew)

Let's put [color.new(color, transp)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dnew) to use to create different transparencies for volume columns using one of two bull/bear base colors:

![image](images/Colors-CalculatingColors-1.BtEyXAO2_Z2dfpcb.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Volume")
// We name our color constants to make them more readable.
var color GOLD_COLOR   = #CCCC00ff
var color VIOLET_COLOR = #AA00FFff
color bullColorInput = input.color(GOLD_COLOR,   "Bull")
color bearColorInput = input.color(VIOLET_COLOR, "Bear")
int levelsInput = input.int(10, "Gradient levels", minval = 1)
// We initialize only once on bar zero with `var`, otherwise the count would reset to zero on each bar.
var float riseFallCnt = 0
// Count the rises/falls, clamping the range to: 1 to `i_levels`.
riseFallCnt := math.max(1, math.min(levelsInput, riseFallCnt + math.sign(volume - nz(volume[1]))))
// Rescale the count on a scale of 80, reverse it and cap transparency to <80 so that colors remains visible.
float transparency = 80 - math.abs(80 * riseFallCnt / levelsInput)
// Build the correct transparency of either the bull or bear color.
color volumeColor = color.new(close > open ? bullColorInput : bearColorInput, transparency)
plot(volume, "Volume", volumeColor, 1, plot.style_columns)
```

Note that:

- In the next to last line of our script, we dynamically calculate the
  column color by varying both the base color used, depending on
  whether the bar is up or down, **and** the transparency level, which
  is calculated from the cumulative rises or falls of volume.
- We offer the script user control over not only the base bull/bear
  colors used, but also on the number of brightness levels we use. We
  use this value to determine the maximum number of rises or falls we
  will track. Giving users the possiblity to manage this value allows
  them to adapt the indicator's visuals to the timeframe or market
  they use.
- We take care to control the maximum level of transparency we use so
  that it never goes higher than 80. This ensures our colors always
  retain some visibility.
- We also set the minimum value for the number of levels to 1 in the
  inputs. When the user selects 1, the volume columns will be either
  in bull or bear color of maximum brightness — or transparency zero.

### [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com#colorrgb)

In our next example we use [color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Drgb) to build colors from RGBA values. We use the result in a holiday season gift for our friends, so they can bring their TradingView charts to parties:

![image](images/Colors-CalculatingColors-2.B7PJa61g_ZI19Ev.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Holiday candles", "", true)
float r = math.random(0, 255)
float g = math.random(0, 255)
float b = math.random(0, 255)
float t = math.random(0, 100)
color holidayColor = color.rgb(r, g, b, t)
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = holidayColor, wickcolor = holidayColor, bordercolor = holidayColor)
```

Note that:

- We generate values in the zero to 255 range for the red, green and
  blue channels, and in the zero to 100 range for transparency. Also
  note that because
  [math.random()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math%7Bdot%7Drandom)
  returns float values, the float 0.0-100.0 range provides access to
  the full 0-255 transparency values of the underlying alpha channel.
- We use the [math.random(min, max,
  seed)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math%7Bdot%7Drandom)
  function to generate pseudo-random values. We do not use an argument
  for the third parameter of the function: `seed`. Using it is handy
  when you want to ensure the repeatability of the function's
  results. Called with the same seed, it will produce the same
  sequence of values.

### [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com#colorfrom_gradient)

Our last examples of color calculations will use [color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient). Let's first use it in its simplest form, to color a CCI signal in a version of the indicator that otherwise looks like the built-in:

![image](images/Colors-CalculatingColors-3.BWe7BFsC_Zg2kjC.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator(title="CCI line gradient", precision=2, timeframe="")
var color GOLD_COLOR   = #CCCC00
var color VIOLET_COLOR = #AA00FF
var color BEIGE_COLOR  = #9C6E1B
float srcInput = input.source(close, title="Source")
int   lenInput = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 5)
color bullColorInput = input.color(GOLD_COLOR,   "Bull")
color bearColorInput = input.color(BEIGE_COLOR, "Bear")
float signal = ta.cci(srcInput, lenInput)
color signalColor = color.from_gradient(signal, -200, 200, bearColorInput, bullColorInput)
plot(signal, "CCI", signalColor)
bandTopPlotID = hline(100,  "Upper Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
bandBotPlotID = hline(-100, "Lower Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
fill(bandTopPlotID, bandBotPlotID, color.new(BEIGE_COLOR, 90), "Background")
```

Note that:

- To calculate the gradient,
  [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient)
  requires minimum and maximum values against which the argument used
  for the `value` parameter will be compared. The fact that we want a
  gradient for an unbounded signal like CCI (i.e., without fixed
  boundaries such as RSI, which always oscillates between 0-100), does
  not entail we cannot use
  [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient).
  Here, we solve our conundrum by providing values of -200 and 200 as
  arguments. They do not represent the real minimum and maximum values
  for CCI, but they are at levels from which we do not mind the colors
  no longer changing, as whenever the series is outside the
  `bottom_value` and `top_value` limits, the colors used for
  `bottom_color` and `top_color` will apply.
- The color progression calculated by
  [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient)
  is linear. If the value of the series is halfway between the
  `bottom_value` and `top_value` arguments, the generated color's
  RGBA components will also be halfway between those of `bottom_color`
  and `top_color`.
- Many common indicator calculations are available in Pine Script™ as
  built-in functions. Here we use
  [ta.cci()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dcci)
  instead of calculating it the long way.

The argument used for `value` in [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient) does not necessarily have to be the value of the line we are calculating. Anything we want can be used, as long as arguments for `bottom_value` and `top_value` can be supplied. Here, we enhance our CCI indicator by coloring the band using the number of bars since the signal has been above/below the centerline:

![image](images/Colors-CalculatingColors-4.-U0l6lwc_Zd5X5K.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator(title="CCI line gradient", precision=2, timeframe="")
var color GOLD_COLOR   = #CCCC00
var color VIOLET_COLOR = #AA00FF  
var color GREEN_BG_COLOR = color.new(color.green, 70)
var color RED_BG_COLOR   = color.new(color.maroon, 70)
float srcInput      = input.source(close, "Source")
int   lenInput      = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 5)
int   stepsInput    = input.int(50, "Gradient levels", minval = 1)
color bullColorInput   = input.color(GOLD_COLOR, "Line: Bull", inline = "11")
color bearColorInput   = input.color(VIOLET_COLOR, "Bear", inline = "11")
color bullBgColorInput = input.color(GREEN_BG_COLOR, "Background: Bull", inline = "12")
color bearBgColorInput = input.color(RED_BG_COLOR, "Bear", inline = "12")

// Plot colored signal line.
float signal = ta.cci(srcInput, lenInput)
color signalColor = color.from_gradient(signal, -200, 200, color.new(bearColorInput, 0), color.new(bullColorInput, 0))
plot(signal, "CCI", signalColor, 2)

// Detect crosses of the centerline.
bool signalX = ta.cross(signal, 0)
// Count no of bars since cross. Capping it to the no of steps from inputs.
int gradientStep = math.min(stepsInput, nz(ta.barssince(signalX)))
// Choose bull/bear end color for the gradient.
color endColor = signal > 0 ? bullBgColorInput : bearBgColorInput
// Get color from gradient going from no color to `c_endColor` 
color bandColor = color.from_gradient(gradientStep, 0, stepsInput, na, endColor)
bandTopPlotID = hline(100,  "Upper Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
bandBotPlotID = hline(-100, "Lower Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
fill(bandTopPlotID, bandBotPlotID, bandColor, title = "Band")
```

Note that:

- The signal plot uses the same base colors and gradient as in our
  previous example. We have however increased the width of the line
  from the default 1 to 2. It is the most important component of our
  visuals; increasing its width is a way to give it more prominence,
  and ensure users are not distracted by the band, which has become
  busier than it was in its original, flat beige color.
- The fill must remain unobtrusive for two reasons. First, it is of
  secondary importance to the visuals, as it provides complementary
  information, i.e., the duration for which the signal has been in
  bull/bear territory. Second, since fills have a greater z-index than
  plots, the fill will cover the signal plot. For these reasons, we
  make the fill's base colors fairly transparent, at 70, so they do
  not mask the plots. The gradient used for the band starts with no
  color at all (see the
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  used as the argument to `bottom_color` in the
  [color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient)
  call), and goes to the base bull/bear colors from the inputs, which
  the conditional, `c_endColor` color variable contains.
- We provide users with distinct bull/bear color selections for the
  line and the band.
- When we calculate the `gradientStep` variable, we use
  [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz)
  on
  [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dbarssince)
  because in early bars of the dataset, when the condition tested has
  not occurred yet,
  [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dbarssince)
  will return
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).
  Because we use
  [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz),
  the value returned is replaced with zero in those cases.

## [Mixing transparencies](https://www.tradingview.com#mixing-transparencies)

In this example we take our CCI indicator in another direction. We will build dynamically adjusting extremes zone buffers using a Donchian Channel (historical highs/lows) calculated from the CCI. We build the top/bottom bands by making them 1/4 the height of the DC. We will use a dynamically adjusting lookback to calculate the DC. To modulate the lookback, we will calculate a simple measure of volatility by keeping a ratio of a short-period ATR to a long one. When that ratio is higher than 50 of its last 100 values, we consider the volatility high. When the volatility is high/low, we decrease/increase the lookback.

Our aim is to provide users of our indicator with:

- The CCI line colored using a bull/bear gradient, as we illustrated
  in our most recent examples.
- The top and bottom bands of the Donchian Channel, filled in such a
  way that their color darkens as a historical high/low becomes older
  and older.
- A way to appreciate the state of our volatility measure, which we
  will do by painting the background with one color whose intensity
  increases when volatility increases.

This is what our indicator looks like using the light theme:

![image](images/Colors-MixingTransparencies-1.DJ-yTBxm_1VcSbJ.png)

And with the dark theme:

fill(loTopPlotID, loBotPlotID, loColor)

bgcolor(bgColor)
```

Note that:

- We clamp the transparency of the background to a 100-75 range so
  that it doesn't overwhelm. We also use a neutral color that will
  not distract too much. The darker the background is, the higher our
  measure of volatility.
- We also clamp the transparency values for the band fills between 60
  and 90. We use 90 so that when a new high/low is found and the
  gradient resets, the starting transparency makes the color somewhat
  visible. We do not use a transparency lower than 60 because we
  don't want those bands to hide the signal line.
- We use the very handy
  [ta.percentrank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpercentrank)
  function to generate a 0-100 value from our ATR ratio measuring
  volatility. It is useful to convert values whose scale is unknown
  into known values that can be used to produce transparencies.
- Because we must clamp values three times in our script, we wrote an
  `f_clamp()` function, instead of explicitly coding the logic three
  times.

## [Tips](https://www.tradingview.com#tips)

### [Maintaining automatic color selectors](https://www.tradingview.com#maintaining-automatic-color-selectors)

Under certain conditions, PineScript can automatically display all of the colors used in script's plots in the "Settings/Styles" menu. These plots are graphics created by all [plot*()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) functions, [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor), and [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor). The user can change the colors using a color picker. This feature allows colors in scripts to be customized without any extra code.

For example, this simple script has a [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) that is colored either teal or red, depending on the relationship between the bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) and [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open). The script does not specify that these colors should be editable, nor does it create any color-related inputs. Nevertheless, PineScript automatically displays the colors in the "Settings/Styles" menu and allows the user to change them, along with the style of the plot:

![image](images/Colors-MaintainAutomaticColorSelection-1.BHISUteP_LNVpG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Color picker showcase")
plotColor = close > open ? color.teal : color.red
plot(close, color = plotColor)
```

The colors in the above script can be automatically displayed in this way because they are *not dynamically calculated* and are known as soon as the script has finished compiling. All colors of the ["const"](#const) type, and all colors of type ["input"](#input) that are *not modified* via the [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) or [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.rgb) functions can be automatically displayed like this.

However, if *even a single calculated color* is of type "simple color" or "series color", or if an "input color" is passed to [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) or [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.rgb), *all* colors are calculated in the script's runtime, and no color pickers are available in the "Style" section.

In practice, the creation of ["simple"](#simple) or ["series"](#series) colors is also most often due to using [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) and [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.rgb) functions. The qualifier of the color that these functions return is the strongest qualifier of the values passed to them. If each call to these functions passes only "const" values, the resulting colors are also "const", and the script *does* display them in the "Styles" menu.

For example, let's try to make the plots in the script above semi-transparent by adding a transparency of `50` to its colors via [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new). The easiest way to do this is to wrap the `plotColor` variable with [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new), like in the example below:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Color picker showcase")
plotColor = color.new(close > open ? color.teal : color.red, 50)
plot(close, color = plotColor)
```

Unfortunately, with these changes the "Style" tab does not display a color picker any longer. This is because we use the "series bool" condition `close > open` to decide the color, and then pass the result of this expression to a single [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) call. The qualified type of the calculated color that it returns is "series color".

![image](images/Colors-MaintainAutomaticColorSelection-2.BO3w97fq_14utEv.png)

![image](images/Colors-MaintainAutomaticColorSelection-3.B0TUMw_p_Z2hnihX.png)

To avoid this, we can ensure that every calculated color created by [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) is a "const color". Below, we wrap teal and red separately with [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) – creating two constant calculated colors in the process – and then decide which one to assign to `plotColor` based on the condition. And while the `plotColor` variable is a "series color", each [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) call returns a constant color, so the script displays a color picker n the "Style" tab:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Color picker showcase")
plotColor = close > open ? color.new(color.teal, 50) : color.new(color.red, 50)
plot(close, color = plotColor)
```

![image](images/Colors-MaintainAutomaticColorSelection-4.B7QSrDzd_18UfnH.png)

To calculate the colors at runtime, create custom color inputs for all of the colors that are to be editable. This approach requires more effort, but allows significantly more control over what the user can affect. Learn more about creating color inputs on the [Inputs page](#color-input).

### [Designing usable colors schemes](https://www.tradingview.com#designing-usable-colors-schemes)

If you write scripts intended for other traders, try to avoid colors that will not work well in some environments, whether it be for plots, labels, tables or fills. At a minimum, test your visuals to ensure they perform satisfactorily with both the light and dark TradingView themes; they are the most commonly used. Colors such as black and white, for example, should be avoided.

Build the appropriate inputs to provide script users the flexibility to adapt your script's visuals to their particular environments.

Take care to build a visual hierarchy of the colors you use that matches the relative importance of your script's visual components. Good designers understand how to achieve the optimal balance of color and weight so the eye is naturally drawn to the most important elements of the design. When you make everything stand out, nothing does. Make room for some elements to stand out by toning down the visuals surrounding it.

Providing a selection of color presets in your inputs — rather than a single color that can be changed — can help color-challenged users. Our [Technical Ratings](https://www.tradingview.com/script/Jdw7wW2g-Technical-Ratings/) demonstrates one way of achieving this.

### [Plot crisp lines](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-crisp-lines)

It is best to use zero transparency to plot the important lines in your visuals, to keep them crisp. This way, they will show through fills more precisely. Keep in mind that fills have a higher z-index than plots, so they are placed on top of them. A slight increase of a line's width can also go a long way in making it stand out.

If you want a special plot to stand out, you can also give it more importance by using multiple plots for the same line. These are examples where we modulate the successive width and transparency of plots to achieve this:

![image](images/Colors-PlotCrispLines-1.CJkrlPd__Z1Me4S0.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
plot(high, "", color.new(color.orange, 80), 8)
plot(high, "", color.new(color.orange, 60), 4)
plot(high, "", color.new(color.orange, 00), 1)

plot(hl2, "", color.new(color.orange, 60), 4)
plot(hl2, "", color.new(color.orange, 00), 1)

plot(low, "", color.new(color.orange, 0), 1)
```

### [Customize gradients](https://www.tradingview.com#customize-gradients)

When building gradients, adapt them to the visuals they apply to. If you are using a gradient to color candles, for example, it is usually best to limit the number of steps in the gradient to ten or less, as it is more difficult for the eye to perceive intensity variations of discrete objects. As we did in our examples, cap minimum and maximum transparency levels so your visual elements remain visible and do not overwhelm when it's not necessary.

# [Fills](https://www.tradingview.com#fills)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Some of Pine Script's visual outputs, including
[plots](#plot-and-hline),
[hlines](#plot-and-hline), [lines](#lines), [boxes](#boxes), and
[polylines](#polylines),
allow one to fill the chart space they occupy with colors. Three
different mechanisms facilitate filling the space between such outputs:

- The
  [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
  function fills the space between two plots from
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  calls or two horizontal lines (hlines) from
  [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
  calls with a specified color.
- Objects of the
  [linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
  type fill the space between
  [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
  instances created with
  [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new).
- Other drawing types, namely
  [boxes](#boxes) and
  [polylines](#polylines), have built-in properties that allow the drawings to
  fill the visual spaces they occupy.

## [`plot()` and `hline()` fills](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-and-hline-fills)

The
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function fills the space between two plots or horizontal lines. It has
the following two signatures:

```
fill(plot1, plot2, color, title, editable, show_last, fillgaps) → voidfill(hline1, hline2, color, title, editable, fillgaps) → void
```

The `plot1`, `plot2`, `hline1`, and `hline2` parameters accept
[plot](#plot-and-hline)
or [hline](#plot-and-hline) IDs returned by
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
and
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
function calls. The
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function is the only built-in that can use these IDs.

This simple example demonstrates how the
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function works with
[plot and hline](#plot-and-hline) IDs. It calls
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
and
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
three times to display arbitrary values on the chart. Each of these
calls returns an ID, which the script assigns to variables for use in
the
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are "plot" IDs, whereas
`h1`, `h2`, and `h3` reference "hline" IDs:

![image](images/Fills-Fill-1.D9hBk6j5_24U1rL.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 1")

// Assign "plot" IDs to the `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` variables.
p1 = plot(math.sin(high), "Sine of `high`")
p2 = plot(math.cos(low), "Cosine of `low`")
p3 = plot(math.sin(close), "Sine of `close`")
// Fill the space between `p1` and `p2` with 90% transparent red.
fill(p1, p3, color.new(color.red, 90), "`p1`-`p3` fill")
// Fill the space between `p2` and `p3` with 90% transparent blue.
fill(p2, p3, color.new(color.blue, 90), "`p2`-`p3` fill")

// Assign "hline" IDs to the `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` variables.
h1 = hline(0, "First level")
h2 = hline(1.0, "Second level")
h3 = hline(0.5, "Third level")
h4 = hline(1.5, "Fourth level")
// Fill the space between `h1` and `h2` with 90% transparent yellow.
fill(h1, h2, color.new(color.yellow, 90), "`h1`-`h2` fill")
// Fill the space between `h3` and `h4` with 90% transparent lime.
fill(h3, h4, color.new(color.lime, 90), "`h3`-`h4` fill")
```

It's important to note that the
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function requires *either* two "plot" IDs or two "hline" IDs. One
*cannot* mix and match these types in the function call. Consequently,
programmers will sometimes need to use
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
where they otherwise might have used
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
if they want to fill the space between a consistent level and a
fluctuating series.

For example, this script calculates an `oscillator` based on the
percentage distance between the chart's
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price and a 10-bar
[SMA](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma),
then plots it on the chart pane. In this case, we wanted to fill the
area between the `oscillator` and zero. Although we can display the zero
level with
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
since its value does not change, we cannot pass a "plot" and "hline"
ID to the
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function. Therefore, we must use a
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
call for the level to allow the script to fill the space:

![image](images/Fills-Fill-2.DlLq_93-_g6Y93.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 2")

//@variable The 10-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float ma = ta.sma(close, 10)
//@variable The distance from the `ma` to the `close` price, as a percentage of the `ma`.
float oscillator = 100 * (ma - close) / ma

//@variable The ID of the `oscillator` plot for use in the `fill()` function.
oscPlotID = plot(oscillator, "Oscillator")
//@variable The ID of the zero level plot for use in the `fill()` function. 
//          Requires a "plot" ID since the `fill()` function can't use "plot" and "hline" IDs at the same time.
zeroPlotID = plot(0, "Zero level", color.silver, 1, plot.style_circles)

// Filll the space between the `oscPlotID` and `zeroPlotID` with 90% transparent blue. 
fill(oscPlotID, zeroPlotID, color.new(color.blue, 90), "Oscillator fill")
```

The `color` parameter of the
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function accepts a "series color" argument, meaning the fill's color
can change across chart bars. For example, this code fills the space
between two moving average plots with 90% transparent green or red
colors based on whether `ma1` is above `ma2`:

![image](images/Fills-Fill-3.CN7oIx5s_1vmNq4.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 3", overlay = true)

//@variable The 5-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float ma1 = ta.sma(close, 5)
//@variable The 20-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float ma2 = ta.sma(close, 20)

//@variable The 90% transparent color of the space between MA plots. Green if `ma1 > ma2`, red otherwise. 
color fillColor = ma1 > ma2 ? color.new(color.green, 90) : color.new(color.red, 90) 

//@variable The ID of the `ma1` plot for use in the `fill()` function.
ma1PlotID = plot(ma1, "5-bar SMA")
//@variable The ID of the `ma2` plot for use in the `fill()` function.
ma2PlotID = plot(ma2, "20-bar SMA")

// Fill the space between the `ma1PlotID` and `ma2PlotID` using the `fillColor`.
fill(ma1PlotID, ma2PlotID, fillColor, "SMA plot fill")
```

## [Line fills](https://www.tradingview.com#line-fills)

While the
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
function allows a script to fill the space between two
[plots or hlines](#plot-and-hline), it does not work with
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
objects. When a script needs to fill the space between
[lines](#lines), it
requires a
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
object created by the
[linefill.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.new)
function. The function has the following signature:

```
linefill.new(line1, line2, color) → series linefill
```

The `line1` and `line2` parameters accept
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
IDs. These IDs determine the chart region that the
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
object will fill with its specified `color`. A script can update the
`color` property of a
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
ID returned by this function by calling
[linefill.set_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.set_color)
with the ID as its `id` argument.

The behavior of linefills depends on the lines they reference. Scripts
cannot move linefills directly, as the lines that a linefill uses
determine the space it will fill. To retrieve the IDs of the
[lines](#lines)
referenced by a
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
object, use the
[linefill.get_line1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.get_line1)
and
[linefill.get_line2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.get_line2)
functions.

Any pair of
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
instances can only have *one*[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
between them. Successive calls to
[linefill.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.new)
using the same `line1` and `line2` arguments will create a new
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
ID that *replaces* the previous one associated with them.

The example below demonstrates a simple use case for linefills. The
script calculates a `pivotHigh` and `pivotLow` series using the built-in
[ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.pivothigh)
and
[ta.pivotlow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.pivotlow)
functions with constant `leftbars` and `rightbars` arguments. On the
last confirmed historical bar, the script draws two extended lines. The
first line connects the two most recent non-na `pivotHigh` values, and
the second connects the most recent non-na `pivotLow` values.

To emphasize the "channel" formed by these lines, the script fills the
space between them using
[linefill.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.new):

![image](images/Fills-Linefill-01.CW8L9l90_ZKe1QM.png)

    secondHighPoint := chart.point.from_index(bar_index - RIGHT_BARS, pivotHigh)
// Update the `firstLowPoint` and `secondLowPoint` when `pivotlow` is not `na`.
if not na(pivotLow)
    firstLowPoint  := secondLowPoint
    secondLowPoint := chart.point.from_index(bar_index - RIGHT_BARS, pivotLow)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable An extended line that passes through the `firstHighPoint` and `secondHighPoint`.
    line pivotHighLine = line.new(firstHighPoint, secondHighPoint, extend = extend.right)
    //@variable An extended line that passes through the `firstLowPoint` and `secondLowPoint`.
    line pivotLowLine = line.new(firstLowPoint, secondLowPoint, extend = extend.right)
    //@variable The color of the space between the lines.
    color fillColor = switch
        secondHighPoint.price > firstHighPoint.price and secondLowPoint.price > firstLowPoint.price => color.lime
        secondHighPoint.price < firstHighPoint.price and secondLowPoint.price < firstLowPoint.price => color.red
        =>                                                                                             color.silver
    //@variable A linefill that colors the space between the `pivotHighLine` and `pivotLowLine`.
    linefill channelFill = linefill.new(pivotHighLine, pivotLowLine, color.new(fillColor, 90))
```

## [Box and polyline fills](https://www.tradingview.com#box-and-polyline-fills)

The
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
and
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
types allow scripts to draw geometric shapes and other formations on the
chart. Scripts create
[boxes](#boxes) and
[polylines](#polylines)
with the
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
and
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
functions, which include parameters that allow the drawings to fill
their visual spaces.

To fill the space inside the borders of a
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
with a specified color, include a `bgcolor` argument in the
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
function. To fill a polyline's visual space, pass a `fill_color`
argument to the
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
function.

For example, this script draws an octagon with a
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
and an inscribed rectangle with a
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box) on
the last confirmed historical bar. It determines the size of the
drawings using the value from the `radius` variable, which corresponds
to approximately one-fourth of the number of bars visible on the chart.
We included `fill_color = color.new(color.blue, 60)` in the
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
call to fill the octagon with a translucent blue color, and we used
`bgcolor = color.purple` in the
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
call to fill the inscribed rectangle with opaque purple:

![image](images/Fills-Box-and-polyline-fills-1.FVYvEaBt_1tmoyk.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Box and polyline fills demo")

//@variable The number of visible chart bars, excluding the leftmost and rightmost bars.
var int barCount = 0
if time > chart.left_visible_bar_time and time < chart.right_visible_bar_time
    barCount += 1

//@variable The approximate radius used to calculate the octagon and rectangle coordinates.
int radius = math.ceil(barCount / 4)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable An array of chart points. The polyline uses all points in this array, but the box only needs two.
    array<chart.point> points = array.new<chart.point>()
    //@variable The counterclockwise angle of each point, in radians. Updates on each loop iteration. 
    float angle = 0.0
    //@variable The radians to add to the `angle` on each loop iteration.
    float increment = 0.25 * math.pi
    // Loop 8 times to calculate octagonal points.
    for i = 0 to 7
        //@variable The point's x-coordinate (bar offset).
        int x = int(math.round(math.cos(angle) * radius))
        //@variable The point's y-coordinate.
        float y = math.round(math.sin(angle) * radius)
        // Push a new chart point into the `points` array and increase the `angle`.
        points.push(chart.point.from_index(bar_index - radius + x, y))
        angle += increment
    // Create a closed polyline to draw the octagon and fill it with translucent blue. 
    polyline.new(points, closed = true, fill_color = color.new(color.blue, 60))
    // Create a box for the rectangle using index 3 and 7 for the top-left and bottom-right corners, 
    // and fill it with opaque purple. 
    box.new(points.get(3), points.get(7), bgcolor = color.purple)
```

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Inputs

# [Inputs](https://www.tradingview.com#inputs)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Inputs receive values that users can change from a script's
"Settings/Inputs" tab. By utilizing inputs, programmers can write
scripts that users can more easily adapt to their preferences.

The following script plots a 20-period [simple moving average
(SMA)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502589) using
[ta.sma(close,
20)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma).
While it is straightforward to write, the code is not very *flexible*
because the function call uses specific `source` and `length` arguments
that users cannot change without modifying the code:

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true)
plot(ta.sma(close, 20))
```

If we write our script this way instead, it becomes much more flexible,
as users can select the `source` and the `length` values they want to
use from the "Settings/Inputs" tab without changing the source code:

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true)
sourceInput = input(close, "Source")
lengthInput = input(20, "Length")
plot(ta.sma(sourceInput, lengthInput))
```

Inputs are only accessible while a script runs on a chart. Users can
access script inputs from the "Settings" dialog box. To open this
dialog, users can:

- Double-click on the name of an on-chart indicator
- Right-click on the script's name and choose the "Settings" item
  from the dropdown menu
- Choose the "Settings" item from the "More" menu icon (three
  dots) that appears when hovering over the indicator's name on the
  chart
- Double-click on the indicator's name from the Data Window (fourth
  icon down to the right of the chart)

The "Settings" dialog always contains the "Style" and "Visibility"
tabs, which allow users to specify their preferences about the script's
visuals and the chart timeframes that can display its outputs.

When a script contains calls to `input.*()` functions, an "Inputs" tab
also appears in the "Settings" dialog box.

![image](images/Inputs-Introduction-1.CNd-sZxz_2qJffB.png)

Scripts process inputs when users add them to the chart or change the
values in the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. Any changes to a
script's inputs prompt it to re-execute across all available data using
the new specified values.

## [Input functions](https://www.tradingview.com#input-functions)

Pine Script™ features the following input functions:

- [input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input)
- [input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)
- [input.float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.float)
- [input.bool()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.bool)
- [input.color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.color)
- [input.string()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.string)
- [input.text_area()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.text_area)
- [input.timeframe()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.timeframe)
- [input.symbol()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.symbol)
- [input.price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.price)
- [input.source()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.source)
- [input.session()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.session)
- [input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time)
- [input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)

Scripts create input *widgets* in the "Inputs" tab that accept
different types of inputs based on their `input.*()` function calls. By
default, each input appears on a new line of the "Inputs" tab in the
order of the `input.*()` calls. Programmers can also organize inputs in
different ways by using the `input.*()` functions' `group` and `inline`
parameters. See [this section](#input-function-parameters) below for more information.

Our [Style guide](#style-guide)
recommends placing `input.*()` calls at the beginning of the script.

Input functions typically contain several parameters that allow
programmers to define their default values, value limits, their
organization in the "Inputs" tab, and other properties.

Since an `input.*()` call is simply another function call in Pine
Script™, programmers can combine them with
[arithmetic](#arithmetic-operators), [comparison](#comparison-operators),
[logical](#logical-operators), and
[ternary](#-ternary-operator)
operators to assign expressions to variables. This simple script
compares the result from a call to
[input.string()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.string)
to the "On" string and assigns the result to the `plotDisplayInput`
variable. This variable is of the "input bool" type because the
[==](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_==)
operator returns a "bool" value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Input in an expression`", "", true)
bool plotDisplayInput = input.string("On", "Plot Display", options = ["On", "Off"]) == "On"
plot(plotDisplayInput ? close : na)
```

All values returned by `input.*()` functions except "source" ones are
"input" qualified values. See our User Manual's section on
[type qualifiers](#qualifiers) for more information.

## [Input function parameters](https://www.tradingview.com#input-function-parameters)

The parameters common to all input functions are: `defval`, `title`,
`tooltip`, `inline`, `group`, and `display`. Some input functions also
include other parameters: `options`, `minval`, `maxval`, `step` and
`confirm`.

All these parameters expect "const" arguments. The only exceptions are
for the `defval` and `options` parameters of the [source](#source-input)
and [enum](#enum-input)
inputs, as
[input.source()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.source)
uses "series float" value, and
[input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
uses *members* of an [enum type](#qualifiers).

Since `input.*()` parameters accept "const" arguments in most cases
and the "input" and other
[qualifiers](#qualifiers)
are stronger than "const", it follows that one cannot use the result
from one `input.*()` call as an argument in another `input.*()` call.

Let's go over each parameter:

- `defval` is the first parameter of all input functions. It is the
  default value that appears in the input widget. It requires an
  argument of the type of input value that the function applies to.
- `title` requires a "const string" argument. It is the field's
  label.
- `tooltip` requires a "const string" argument. When the parameter
  is used, a question mark icon will appear to the right of the field.
  When users hover over it, the tooltip's text will appear. Note that
  if multiple input fields are grouped on one line using `inline`, the
  tooltip will always appear to the right of the rightmost field, and
  display the text of the last `tooltip` argument used in the line.
  Newlines (`\n`) are supported in the argument string.
- `inline` requires a "const string" argument. Using the same
  argument for the parameter in multiple `input.*()` calls will group
  their input widgets on the same line. There is a limit to the width
  the "Inputs" tab will expand, so a limited quantity of input
  fields can be fitted on one line. Using one `input.*()` call with a
  unique argument for `inline` has the effect of bringing the input
  field left, immediately after the label, foregoing the default
  left-alignment of all input fields used when no `inline` argument is
  used.
- `group` requires a "const string" argument. Use it to group any
  number of inputs in an organized section. The string used as the
  `group` argument becomes the section's heading. All `input.*()`
  calls to be grouped together must use the same string for their
  `group` argument.
- `options` requires a comma-separated list of elements enclosed in
  square brackets (e.g., `["ON", "OFF"]`, `[1, 2, 3]`,
  `[myEnum.On, myEnum.Off]`). The input uses the specified elements as
  menu selections in its resulting dropdown widget. Users can only
  select one menu item at a time. When supplying an `options` list,
  the `defval` value must be one of the list's elements. Inputs that
  allow `minval`, `maxval`, or `step` parameters cannot use those
  parameters and the `options` parameter simultaneously.
- `minval` requires a "const int/float" argument, depending on the
  type of the `defval` value. It is the minimum valid value for the
  input field.
- `maxval` requires a "const int/float" argument, depending on the
  type of the `defval` value. It is the maximum valid value for the
  input field.
- `step` is the increment by which the field's value will move when
  the widget's up/down arrows are used.
- `confirm` requires a "const bool" (`true` or `false`) argument.
  This parameter affects the behavior of the script when it is added
  to a chart. `input.*()` calls using `confirm = true` will cause the
  "Settings/Inputs" tab to popup when the script is added to the
  chart. `confirm` is useful to ensure that users configure a
  particular field.

The `minval`, `maxval` and `step` parameters are only present in the
signature of the
[input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)
and
[input.float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.float)
functions.

## [Input types](https://www.tradingview.com#input-types)

The next sections explain what each input function does. As we proceed,
we will explore the different ways you can use input functions and
organize their display.

### [Generic input](https://www.tradingview.com#generic-input)

[input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input)
is a simple, generic function that supports the fundamental Pine Script™
types: "int", "float", "bool", "color" and "string". It also
supports "source" inputs, which are price-related values such as
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
[hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#hl2),
[hlc3](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlc3),
and
[hlcc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlcc4),
or which can be used to receive the output value of another script.

Its signature is:

```
input(defval, title, tooltip, inline, group) → input int/float/bool/color/string | series float
```

The function automatically detects the type of input by analyzing the
type of the `defval` argument used in the function call. This script
shows all the supported types and the qualified type returned by the
function when used with `defval` arguments of different types:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`input()`", "", true)
a = input(1, "input int")
b = input(1.0, "input float")
c = input(true, "input bool")
d = input(color.orange, "input color")
e = input("1", "input string")
f = input(close, "series float")
plot(na)
```

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-01.Cq1mAVhd_Z1FJl78.png)

### [Integer input](https://www.tradingview.com#integer-input)

Two signatures exist for the
[input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)
function; one when `options` is not used, the other when it is:

```
input.int(defval, title, minval, maxval, step, tooltip, inline, group, confirm) → input intinput.int(defval, title, options, tooltip, inline, group, confirm) → input int
```

This call uses the `options` parameter to propose a pre-defined list of
lengths for the MA:

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10, options = [3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 50, 100, 200])
ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
plot(ma)
```

This one uses the `minval` parameter to limit the length:

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10, minval = 2)
ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
plot(ma)
```

The version with the `options` list uses a dropdown menu for its widget.
When the `options` parameter is not used, a simple input widget is used
to enter the value:

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-02.CZ6pYgBC_2jU4nO.png)

### [Float input](https://www.tradingview.com#float-input)

Two signatures exist for the
[input.float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.float)
function; one when `options` is not used, the other when it is:

```
input.float(defval, title, minval, maxval, step, tooltip, inline, group, confirm) → input intinput.float(defval, title, options, tooltip, inline, group, confirm) → input int
```

Here, we use a "float" input for the factor used to multiple the
standard deviation, to calculate Bollinger Bands:

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10, minval = 1)
bbFactorInput = input.float(1.5, minval = 0, step = 0.5)
ma      = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
bbWidth = ta.stdev(ma, maLengthInput) * bbFactorInput
bbHi    = ma + bbWidth
bbLo    = ma - bbWidth
plot(ma)
plot(bbHi, "BB Hi", color.gray)
plot(bbLo, "BB Lo", color.gray)
```

The input widgets for floats are similar to the ones used for integer
inputs:

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-03.3O4JqasJ_ALMjG.png)

### [Boolean input](https://www.tradingview.com#boolean-input)

Let's continue to develop our script further, this time by adding a
boolean input to allow users to toggle the display of the BBs:

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-04.BsSpKR3Q_Za4RlV.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10,    "MA length", minval = 1)
bbFactorInput = input.float(1.5, "BB factor", inline = "01", minval = 0, step = 0.5)
showBBInput   = input.bool(true, "Show BB",   inline = "01")
ma      = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
bbWidth = ta.stdev(ma, maLengthInput) * bbFactorInput
bbHi    = ma + bbWidth
bbLo    = ma - bbWidth
plot(ma, "MA", color.aqua)
plot(showBBInput ? bbHi : na, "BB Hi", color.gray)
plot(showBBInput ? bbLo : na, "BB Lo", color.gray)
```

Note that:

- We have added an input using
  [input.bool()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.bool)
  to set the value of `showBBInput`.
- We use the `inline` parameter in that input and in the one for
  `bbFactorInput` to bring them on the same line. We use `"01"` for
  its argument in both cases. That is how the Pine Script™ compiler
  recognizes that they belong on the same line. The particular string
  used as an argument is unimportant and does not appear anywhere in
  the "Inputs" tab; it is only used to identify which inputs go on
  the same line.
- We have vertically aligned the `title` arguments of our `input.*()`
  calls to make them easier to read.
- We use the `showBBInput` variable in our two
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  calls to plot conditionally. When the user unchecks the checkbox of
  the `showBBInput` input, the variable's value becomes `false`. When
  that happens, our
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  calls plot the
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  value, which displays nothing. We use `true` as the default value of
  the input, so the BBs plot by default.
- Because we use the `inline` parameter for the `bbFactorInput`
  variable, its input field in the "Inputs" tab does not align
  vertically with that of `maLengthInput`, which doesn't use
  `inline`.

### [Color input](https://www.tradingview.com#color-input)

As explained in
[this](#maintaining-automatic-color-selectors) section of the [Colors](#colors) page, selecting the colors of a script's outputs via the
"Settings/Style" tab is not always possible. In the case where one
cannot choose colors from the "Style" tab, programmers can create
color inputs with the
[input.color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.color)
function to allow color customization from the "Settings/Inputs" tab.

Suppose we wanted to plot our BBs with a ligther transparency when the
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
values are higher/lower than the BBs. We can use a code like this to
create the colors:

```
bbHiColor = color.new(color.gray, high > bbHi ? 60 : 0)
bbLoColor = color.new(color.gray, low  < bbLo ? 60 : 0)
```

When using dynamic ("series") color components like the `transp`
arguments in the above code, the color widgets in the "Settings/Style"
tab will no longer appear. Let's create our own input for color
selection, which will appear in the "Settings/Inputs" tab:

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-05.D_uuADST_ZadKOP.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10,           "MA length", inline = "01", minval = 1)
maColorInput  = input.color(color.aqua, "",          inline = "01")
bbFactorInput = input.float(1.5,        "BB factor", inline = "02", minval = 0, step = 0.5)
bbColorInput  = input.color(color.gray, "",          inline = "02")
showBBInput   = input.bool(true,        "Show BB",   inline = "02")
ma      = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
bbWidth = ta.stdev(ma, maLengthInput) * bbFactorInput
bbHi    = ma + bbWidth
bbLo    = ma - bbWidth
bbHiColor = color.new(bbColorInput, high > bbHi ? 60 : 0)
bbLoColor = color.new(bbColorInput, low  < bbLo ? 60 : 0)
plot(ma, "MA", maColorInput)
plot(showBBInput ? bbHi : na, "BB Hi", bbHiColor, 2)
plot(showBBInput ? bbLo : na, "BB Lo", bbLoColor, 2)
```

Note that:

- We have added two calls to
  [input.color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.color)
  to gather the values of the `maColorInput` and `bbColorInput`
  variables. We use `maColorInput` directly in the
  `plot(ma, "MA", maColorInput)` call, and we use `bbColorInput` to
  build the `bbHiColor` and `bbLoColor` variables, which modulate the
  transparency using the position of price relative to the BBs. We use
  a conditional value for the `transp` value we call
  [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new)
  with, to generate different transparencies of the same base color.
- We do not use a `title` argument for our new color inputs because
  they are on the same line as other inputs allowing users to
  understand to which plots they apply.
- We have reorganized our `inline` arguments so they reflect the fact
  we have inputs grouped on two distinct lines.

### [Timeframe input](https://www.tradingview.com#timeframe-input)

The [input.timeframe()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.timeframe) function creates a dropdown input containing *timeframe choices*. It returns a "string" value representing the selected timeframe in our [specification format](#timeframe-string-specifications), which scripts can use in `request.*()` calls to retrieve data from user-selected timeframes.

The following script uses [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) on each bar to fetch the value of a [ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma) call from a user-specified higher timeframe, then plots the result on the chart:

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-06.BvUY6GL6_Z14lcBY.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Timeframe input demo", "MA", true)

//@variable The timeframe of the requested data.
string tfInput = input.timeframe("1D", "Timeframe")

// Get the typical number of seconds in the chart's timeframe and the `tfInput` timeframe. 
int chartSeconds = timeframe.in_seconds()
int tfSeconds    = timeframe.in_seconds(tfInput)
// Raise an error if the `tfInput` is a lower timeframe.
if tfSeconds < chartSeconds
    runtime.error("The 'Timeframe' input must represent a timeframe higher than or equal to the chart's.")

//@variable The offset of the requested expression. 1 when `tfInput` is a higher timeframe, 0 otherwise. 
int offset = chartSeconds == tfSeconds ? 0 : 1
//@variable The 20-bar SMA of `close` prices for the current symbol from the `tfInput` timeframe.
float maHTF = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, tfInput, ta.sma(close, 20)[offset], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

// Plot the `maHTF` value.
plot(maHTF, "MA", color.aqua)
```

Note that:

- By default, the [input.timeframe()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.timeframe) call's dropdown contains options for the chart's timeframe and all timeframes listed in the chart's "Time interval" menu. To restrict the available options to specific preset timeframes, pass a [tuple](#tuples) of timeframe strings to the function's `options` parameter.
- This script raises a [runtime error](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_runtime.error) if the estimated [number of seconds](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds) in the `tfInput` timeframe is *less* than the number of seconds in the main timeframe, preventing it from requesting lower-timeframe data. See [this section](#higher-timeframes) of the [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page to learn more.
- The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call uses [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_on) as its `lookahead` argument, and it offsets the `expression` argument by one bar when the `tfInput` represents a *higher timeframe* to [avoid repainting](#avoiding-repainting).

### [Symbol input](https://www.tradingview.com#symbol-input)

The [input.symbol()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.symbol) function creates an input widget that mirrors the chart's "Symbol Search" widget. It returns a "string" *ticker identifier* representing the chosen symbol and exchange, which scripts can use in `request.*()` calls to retrieve data from other contexts.

The script below uses [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) to retrieve the value of a [ta.rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi) call evaluated on a user-specified symbol's prices. It plots the requested result on the chart in a separate pane:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Symbol input demo", "RSI")

//@variable The ticker ID of the requested data. By default, it is an empty "string", which specifies the main symbol. 
string symbolInput = input.symbol("", "Symbol")

//@variable The 14-bar RSI of `close` prices for the `symbolInput` symbol on the script's main timeframe. 
float symbolRSI = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.rsi(close, 14))

// Plot the `symbolRSI` value.
plot(symbolRSI, "RSI", color.aqua)
```

Note that:

- The `defval` argument in the [input.symbol()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.symbol) call is an empty "string". When the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call in this example uses this default value as the `symbol` argument, it calculates the RSI using the *chart symbol's* data. If the user wants to revert to the chart's symbol after choosing another symbol, they can select "Reset settings" from the "Defaults" dropdown at the bottom of the "Settings" menu.

### [Session input](https://www.tradingview.com#session-input)

Session inputs are useful to gather start-stop values for periods of
time. The
[input.session()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.session)
built-in function creates an input widget allowing users to specify the
beginning and end time of a session. Selections can be made using a
dropdown menu, or by entering time values in "hh:mm" format.

The value returned by
[input.session()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.session)
is a valid string in session format. See the manual's page on
[sessions](#sessions) for more
information.

Session information can also contain information on the days where the
session is valid. We use an
[input.string()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.string)
function call here to input that day information:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Session input", "", true)
string sessionInput = input.session("0600-1700", "Session")
string daysInput = input.string("1234567", tooltip = "1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday")
sessionString = sessionInput + ":" + daysInput
inSession = not na(time(timeframe.period, sessionString))
bgcolor(inSession ? color.silver : na)
```

Note that:

- This script proposes a default session of "0600-1700".
- The
  [input.string()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.string)
  call uses a tooltip to provide users with help on the format to use
  to enter day information.
- A complete session string is built by concatenating the two strings
  the script receives as inputs.
- We explicitly declare the type of our two inputs with the
  [string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_string)
  keyword to make it clear those variables will contain a string.
- We detect if the chart bar is in the user-defined session by calling
  [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
  with the session string. If the current bar's
  [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
  value (the time at the bar's
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open))
  is not in the session,
  [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
  returns
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
  so `inSession` will be `true` whenever
  [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
  returns a value that is not
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-07.DBQQqMr6_15fqiC.png)

### [Source input](https://www.tradingview.com#source-input)

Source inputs are useful to provide a selection of two types of sources:

- Price values, namely:
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low),
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
  [hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2),
  [hlc3](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlc3),
  and
  [ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4).
- The values plotted by other scripts on the chart. This can be useful
  to "link" two or more scripts together by sending the output of
  one as an input to another script.

This script simply plots the user's selection of source. We propose the
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
as the default value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Source input", "", true)
srcInput = input.source(high, "Source")
plot(srcInput, "Src", color.new(color.purple, 70), 6)
```

This shows a chart where, in addition to our script, we have loaded an
"Arnaud Legoux Moving Average" indicator. See here how we use our
script's source input widget to select the output of the ALMA script as
an input into our script. Because our script plots that source in a
light-purple thick line, you see the plots from the two scripts overlap
because they plot the same value:

![image](images/Inputs-InputTypes-08.SH4c1RFT_1XVzNK.png)

### [Time input](https://www.tradingview.com#time-input)

Time inputs use the
[input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time)
function. The function returns a Unix time in milliseconds (see the
[Time](#time) page for more
information). This type of data also contains date information, so the
[input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time)
function returns a time **and** a date. That is the reason why its
widget allows for the selection of both.

Here, we test the bar's time against an input value, and we plot an
arrow when it is greater:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Time input", "T", true)
timeAndDateInput = input.time(timestamp("1 Aug 2021 00:00 +0300"), "Date and time")
barIsLater = time > timeAndDateInput
plotchar(barIsLater, "barIsLater", "🠆", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

Note that the `defval` value we use is a call to the
[timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp)
function.

### [Enum input](https://www.tradingview.com#enum-input)

The
[input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
function creates a dropdown input that displays *field titles*
corresponding to distinct *members* (possible values) of an
[enum type](#enum-types). The function returns one of the unique, named values from a
declared [enum](#enums), which scripts
can use in calculations and logic requiring more strict control over
allowed values and operations. Supply a list of enum members to the
`options` parameter to specify the members users can select from the
dropdown. If one does not specify an enum field's title, its title is
the "string" representation of its *name*.

This example declares a `SignalType` enum with four fields representing
named signal display modes: `long`, `short`, `both`, and `none`. The
script uses a member of this
[enum type](#enum-types) as the `defval` argument in the
[input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
call to generate a dropdown in the "Inputs" tab, allowing users to
select one of the enum's titles to control which signals it displays on
the chart:

![image](images/Inputs-Input-types-Enum-input-1.D56ry8Yz_4z6vc.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Enum input demo", overlay = true)

//@enum         An enumeration of named values representing signal display modes.
//@field long   Named value to specify that only long signals are allowed.
//@field short  Named value to specify that only short signals are allowed.
//@field both   Named value to specify that either signal type is allowed.
//@field none   Named value to specify that no signals are allowed. 
enum SignalType
    long  = "Only long signals"
    short = "Only short signals"
    both  = "Long and short signals"
    none 

//@variable An enumerator (member) of the `SignalType` enum. Controls the script's signals. 
SignalType sigInput = input.enum(SignalType.long, "Signal type")

// Calculate moving averages.
float ma1 = ta.sma(ohlc4, 10)
float ma2 = ta.sma(ohlc4, 200)
// Calculate cross signals. 
bool longCross  = ta.crossover(close, math.max(ma1, ma2))
bool shortCross = ta.crossunder(close, math.min(ma1, ma2))
// Calculate long and short signals based on the selected `sigInput` value.
bool longSignal = (sigInput == SignalType.long or sigInput == SignalType.both) and longCross
bool shortSignal = (sigInput == SignalType.short or sigInput == SignalType.both) and shortCross

// Plot shapes for the `longSignal` and `shortSignal`.
plotshape(longSignal, "Long signal", shape.triangleup, location.belowbar, color.teal, size = size.normal)
plotshape(shortSignal, "Short signal", shape.triangledown, location.abovebar, color.maroon, size = size.normal)
// Plot the moving averages.
plot(ma1, "Fast MA")
plot(ma2, "Slow MA")
```

Note that:

- The `sigInput` value is the `SignalType` member whose field
  contains the selected title.
- Since we did not specify a title for the `none` field of the
  enum, its title is the "string" representation of its name
  ("none"), as we see in the above image of the enum input's
  dropdown.

By default, an enum input displays the titles of all an enum's members
within its dropdown. If we supply an `options` argument to the
[input.enum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.enum)
call, it will only allow users to select the members included in that
list, e.g.:

```
SignalType sigInput = input.enum(SignalType.long, "Signal type", options = [SignalType.long, SignalType.short])
```

The above `options` argument specifies that users can only view and
select the titles of the `long` and `short` fields from the `SignalType`
enum. No other options are allowed:

![image](images/Inputs-Input-types-Enum-input-2.DoT-LWc3_nngA2.png)

## [Other features affecting Inputs](https://www.tradingview.com#other-features-affecting-inputs)

Some parameters of the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
and
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
functions populate a script's "Settings/Inputs" tab with additional
inputs. These parameters are `timeframe`, `timeframe_gaps`, and
`calc_bars_count`. For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("MA", "", true, timeframe = "D", timeframe_gaps = false)
plot(ta.vwma(close, 10))
```

![image](images/Inputs-OtherFeaturesAffectingInputs-03.BtNE-F7g_ecT8G.png)

## [Tips](https://www.tradingview.com#tips)

The design of your script's inputs has an important impact on the
usability of your scripts. Well-designed inputs are more intuitively
usable and make for a better user experience:

- Choose clear and concise labels (your input's `title` argument).
- Choose your default values carefully.
- Provide `minval` and `maxval` values that will prevent your code
  from producing unexpected results, e.g., limit the minimal value of
  lengths to 1 or 2, depending on the type of MA you are using.
- Provide a `step` value that is congruent with the value you are
  capturing. Steps of 5 can be more useful on a 0-200 range, for
  example, or steps of 0.05 on a 0.0-1.0 scale.
- Group related inputs on the same line using `inline`; bull and bear
  colors for example, or the width and color of a line.
- When you have many inputs, group them into meaningful sections using
  `group`. Place the most important sections at the top.
- Do the same for individual inputs **within** sections.

It can be advantageous to vertically align different arguments of
multliple `input.*()` calls in your code. When you need to make global
changes, this will allow you to use the Editor's multi-cursor feature
to operate on all the lines at once.

Because It is sometimes necessary to use Unicode spaces to In order to
achieve optimal alignment in inputs. This is an example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Aligned inputs", "", true)

var GRP1 = "Not aligned"
ma1SourceInput   = input(close, "MA source",     inline = "11", group = GRP1)
ma1LengthInput   = input(close, "Length",        inline = "11", group = GRP1)
long1SourceInput = input(close, "Signal source", inline = "12", group = GRP1)
long1LengthInput = input(close, "Length",        inline = "12", group = GRP1)

var GRP2 = "Aligned"
// The three spaces after "MA source" are Unicode EN spaces (U+2002).
ma2SourceInput   = input(close, "MA source   ",  inline = "21", group = GRP2)
ma2LengthInput   = input(close, "Length",        inline = "21", group = GRP2)
long2SourceInput = input(close, "Signal source", inline = "22", group = GRP2)
long2LengthInput = input(close, "Length",        inline = "22", group = GRP2)

plot(ta.vwma(close, 10))
```

![image](images/Inputs-Tips-1.DU-DannF_Eodj8.png)

Note that:

- We use the `group` parameter to distinguish between the two sections
  of inputs. We use a constant to hold the name of the groups. This
  way, if we decide to change the name of the group, we only need to
  change it in one place.
- The first sections inputs widgets do not align vertically. We are
  using `inline`, which places the input widgets immediately to the
  right of the label. Because the labels for the `ma1SourceInput` and
  `long1SourceInput` inputs are of different lengths the labels are in
  different *y* positions.
- To make up for the misalignment, we pad the `title` argument in the
  `ma2SourceInput` line with three Unicode EN spaces (U+2002). Unicode
  spaces are necessary because ordinary spaces would be stripped from
  the label. You can achieve precise alignment by combining different
  quantities and types of Unicode spaces. See here for a list of
  [Unicode spaces](https://jkorpela.fi/chars/spaces.html) of different
  widths.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Levels

# [Levels](https://www.tradingview.com#levels)

## [`hline()` levels](https://www.tradingview.com#hline-levels)

Levels are lines plotted using the
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
function. It is designed to plot **horizontal** levels using a **single
color**, i.e., it does not change on different bars. See the
[Levels](#levels) section of the
page on
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#plot) for
alternative ways to plot levels when
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
won't do what you need.

The function has the following signature:

```
hline(price, title, color, linestyle, linewidth, editable) → hline
```

[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
has a few constraints when compared to
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot):

- Since the function's objective is to plot horizontal lines, its
  `price` parameter requires an "input int/float" argument, which
  means that "series float" values such as
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  or dynamically-calculated values cannot be used.
- Its `color` parameter requires an "input int" argument, which
  precludes the use of dynamic colors, i.e., colors calculated on each
  bar — or "series color" values.
- Three different line styles are supported through the `linestyle`
  parameter: `hline.style_solid`, `hline.style_dotted` and
  `hline.style_dashed`.

Let's see
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
in action in the "True Strength Index" indicator:

```
//@version=6
indicator("TSI")
myTSI = 100 * ta.tsi(close, 25, 13)

hline( 50, "+50",  color.lime)
hline( 25, "+25",  color.green)
hline(  0, "Zero", color.gray, linestyle = hline.style_dotted)
hline(-25, "-25",  color.maroon)
hline(-50, "-50",  color.red)

plot(myTSI)
```

![image](images/Levels-HlineLevels-01.DkWkzgaN_R6tzp.png)

![image](images/Levels-HlineLevels-02.rezExM6T_1CI5EH.png)

Note that:

- We display 5 levels, each of a different color.
- We use a different line style for the zero centerline.
- We choose colors that will work well on both light and dark themes.
- The usual range for the indicator's values is +100 to -100. Since
  the
  [ta.tsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dtsi)
  built-in returns values in the +1 to -1 range, we make the
  adjustment in our code.

## [Fills between levels](https://www.tradingview.com#fills-between-levels)

The space between two levels plotted with
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
can be colored using
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill).
Keep in mind that **both** plots must have been plotted with
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline).

Let's put some background colors in our TSI indicator:

```
//@version=6
indicator("TSI")
myTSI = 100 * ta.tsi(close, 25, 13)

plus50Hline  = hline( 50, "+50",  color.lime)
plus25Hline  = hline( 25, "+25",  color.green)
zeroHline    = hline(  0, "Zero", color.gray, linestyle = hline.style_dotted)
minus25Hline = hline(-25, "-25",  color.maroon)
minus50Hline = hline(-50, "-50",  color.red)

// ————— Function returns a color in a light shade for use as a background.
fillColor(color col) =>
    color.new(col, 90)

fill(plus50Hline,  plus25Hline,  fillColor(color.lime))
fill(plus25Hline,  zeroHline,    fillColor(color.teal))
fill(zeroHline,    minus25Hline, fillColor(color.maroon))
fill(minus25Hline, minus50Hline, fillColor(color.red))

plot(myTSI)
```

![image](images/Levels-FillBetweenLevels-01.xe2ic_uc_Z2mX9Cm.png)

![image](images/Levels-FillBetweenLevels-02.CUTgokP3_Z2tYq6M.png)

Note that:

- We have now used the return value of our
  [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
  function calls, which is of the
  [hline](#plot-and-hline) special type. We use the `plus50Hline`, `plus25Hline`,
  `zeroHline`, `minus25Hline` and `minus50Hline` variables to store
  those "hline" IDs because we will need them in our
  [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
  calls later.
- To generate lighter color shades for the background colors, we
  declare a `fillColor()` function that accepts a color and returns
  its 90 transparency. We use calls to that function for the `color`
  arguments in our
  [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
  calls.
- We make our
  [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill)
  calls for each of the four different fills we want, between four
  different pairs of levels.
- We use `color.teal` in our second fill because it produces a green
  that fits the color scheme better than the `color.green` used for
  the 25 level.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Libraries

# [Libraries](https://www.tradingview.com#libraries)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ libraries are publications containing functions that can be
reused in indicators, strategies, or in other libraries. They are useful
to define frequently-used functions so their source code does not have
to be included in every script where they are needed.

A library must be published (privately or publicly) before it can be
used in another script. All libraries are published open-source. Public
scripts can only use public libraries and they must be open-source.
Private scripts or personal scripts saved in the Pine Script™ Editor can
use public or private libraries. A library can use other libraries, or
even previous versions of itself.

Library programmers should be familiar with Pine's typing nomenclature, scopes, and user-defined functions. For more information, see the User Manual's pages on the [Type system](#type-system) and [User-defined functions](#user-defined-functions).

You can browse public library scripts in the [Community Scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/?script_type=libraries) feed.

## [Creating a library](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-a-library)

A library is a special kind of script that begins with the
[library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)
declaration statement, rather than
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
or
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy).
A library contains exportable
[function](#user-defined-functions),
[method](#user-defined-methods),
[UDT](#user-defined-types),
and [enum](#enum-types) definitions, which constitute the only visible part of the
library when imported by another script. Like other script types,
libraries can also include Pine Script™ code in their global scopes.
Programmers typically use a library's global code to demonstrate how
other scripts can use its exported structures.

A library script has a structure like the following, which must include
one or more exportable functions or types:

```
//@version=6

// @description <library_description>
library(title, overlay)

<script_code>

//@type <type_description>
//@field <field_name> <field_description>
// ...
export type <UDT_identifier>
    <field_type> <field_name>[ = <value>]   
    ... 

//@enum <enum_description>
//@field <field_name> <field_description>
// ...
export enum <enum_name>
    <field_name>[ = <field_title>]
    ...

//@function <function_description>
//@param <parameter> <parameter_description>
//@returns <return_value_description>
export <function_name>([simple/series] <parameter_type> <parameter_name> [= <default_value>] [, ...]) =>
    <function_code>

<script_code>
```

Note that:

- The `//@description`, `//@enum`, `//@type`, `@field`,
  `// @function`, `// @param`, and `// @returns`[compiler annotations](#compiler-annotations) are optional but we highly recommend you use them. These
  annotations document the library's code and populate the default
  library description, which authors can use when publishing the
  library.
- The
  [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export)
  keyword is mandatory.
- <parameter_type> is mandatory, contrary to user-defined function
  parameter definitions in indicators or strategies, which are
  typeless.
- <script_code> can be any code one would normally use in an
  indicator, including [inputs](#inputs).

This is an example library:

```
//@version=6

// @description Provides functions calculating the all-time high/low of values.
library("AllTimeHighLow", true)

// @function Calculates the all-time high of a series.
// @param val Series to use (`high` is used if no argument is supplied).
// @returns The all-time high for the series.
export hi(float val = high) =>
    var float ath = val
    ath := math.max(ath, val)

// @function Calculates the all-time low of a series.
// @param val Series to use (`low` is used if no argument is supplied).
// @returns The all-time low for the series.
export lo(float val = low) =>
    var float atl = val
    atl := math.min(atl, val)

plot(hi())
plot(lo())
```

### [Library functions](https://www.tradingview.com#library-functions)

Exported functions and methods have slightly different requirements and constraints compared to non-exported functions.

In exported library function signatures (their first line):

- The [export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export) is mandatory.
- The function's signature must include type keywords to specify the required [type](#types) for each parameter.
- Programmers can include either the [simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple) or [series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_series) qualifier keywords to specify the qualified type each parameter accepts. See the [next section](#qualified-type-control) for more information.

Exported library functions have the following constraints:

- They cannot use variables from the library's global scope except for those with the "const" qualifier, meaning they cannot use global variables initialized from script inputs, for example, or globally declared [arrays](#arrays).
- They cannot include calls to any `input.*()` functions.
- They *can* include `request.*()` calls in their local scopes (if the `dynamic_requests` parameter is not set to `false` in the library declaration statement), but the `expression` arguments of these calls cannot depend on any exported function parameters. See [this section](#dynamic-requests) of the [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page to learn more about dynamic requests.

Library functions always return "simple" or "series" results. Consequently, scripts cannot use their returned values in locations requiring "const" or "input" values. For example, a library function cannot calculate an argument for the `show_last` parameter in a [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call because the parameter requires an "input int" qualified type.

### [Qualified type control](https://www.tradingview.com#qualified-type-control)

The qualified types of arguments supplied in calls to library functions
are autodetected based on how each argument is used inside the function.
If the argument can be used as a "series", it is qualified as such. If
it cannot, an attempt is made with the "simple" type qualifier. This
explains why this code:

```
export myEma(int x) =>
    ta.ema(close, x)
```

will work when called using `myCustomLibrary.myEma(20)`, even though
[ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dema)'s
`length` parameter requires a "simple int" argument. When the Pine
Script™ compiler detects that a "series" length cannot be used with
[ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dema),
it tries the "simple" qualifier, which in this case is allowed.

While library functions cannot return "const" or "input" values,
they can be written to produce "simple" results. This makes them
useful in more contexts than functions returning "series" results, as
some built-in functions do not allow "series" arguments. For example,
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
requires a "simple string" argument for its `symbol` parameter when a script does not allow [dynamic requests](#dynamic-requests). If we wrote a
library function to assemble the argument to `symbol` in the following
way, the function's result would not work with a non-dynamic `request.*()` call because it is of the "series
string" qualified type:

```
export makeTickerid(string prefix, string ticker) =>
    prefix + ":" + ticker
```

However, by restricting the parameter qualifiers to "simple", we can
force the function to yield a "simple" result. We can achieve this by
prefixing the parameters' type with the
[simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple)
keyword:

```
export makeTickerid(simple string prefix, simple string ticker) =>
    prefix + ":" + ticker
```

Note that for the function to return a "simple" value, no "series"
values can be used in its calculation; otherwise the result will be a
"series" value.

One can also use the
[series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple)
keyword to prefix the type of a library function parameter. However,
because arguments are qualified as "series" by default, using the
[series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_simple)
modifier is redundant.

### [User-defined types and objects](https://www.tradingview.com#user-defined-types-and-objects)

Libraries can export [user-defined types (UDTs)](#user-defined-types), and library functions can return [objects](#objects) of these types.

To export a UDT, prefix its definition with the
[export](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_export)
keyword, similar to exporting a function:

```
//@version=6    
library("Point")    

export type point   
    int x   
    float y 
    bool isHi   
    bool wasBreached = false
```

A script importing that library and creating an
[object](#objects) of its `point` UDT
would look somewhat like this:

```
//@version=6  
indicator("") 
import userName/Point/1 as pt 
newPoint = pt.point.new()
```

Note that:

- This code won't compile because no "Point" library is published,
  and the script doesn't display anything.
- `userName` would need to be replaced by the TradingView user name of
  the library's publisher.
- We use the built-in `new()` method to create an object from the
  `point` UDT.
- We prefix the reference to the library's `point` UDT with the `pt`
  alias defined in the
  [import](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_import)
  statement, just like we would when using a function from an imported
  library.

A library **must** export a
[UDT](#user-defined-types) if
any exported functions or methods accept or return an
[object](#objects) of that type, or if
the fields of another exported
[UDT](#user-defined-types)
accept an instance of the type.

When a library only uses a
[UDT](#user-defined-types)
internally, it does not need to export the type. The following library
uses the `point` type internally, but it only exports the `drawPivots()`
function, which does not have a parameter of the `point` type or return
a `point`[object](#objects):

```
//@version=6    
library("PivotLabels", true)    

// We use this `point` UDT in the library, but it does NOT require exporting because    
//   1. The exported function's parameters do not use the UDT.  
//   2. The exported function does not return a UDT result. 
type point  
    int x   
    float y 
    bool isHi   
    bool wasBreached = false    

fillPivotsArray(qtyLabels, leftLegs, rightLegs) =>  
    // Create an array of the specified qty of pivots to maintain.  
    var pivotsArray = array.new<point>(math.max(qtyLabels, 0))  

    // Detect pivots.   
    float pivotHi = ta.pivothigh(leftLegs, rightLegs)   
    float pivotLo = ta.pivotlow(leftLegs, rightLegs)    

    // Create a new `point` object when a pivot is found.   
    point foundPoint = switch   
        not na(pivotHi) => point.new(time[rightLegs], pivotHi, true)    
        not na(pivotLo) => point.new(time[rightLegs], pivotLo, false)   
        => na   

    // Add new pivot info to the array and remove the oldest pivot. 
    if not na(foundPoint)   
        array.push(pivotsArray, foundPoint) 
        array.shift(pivotsArray)    

    array<point> result = pivotsArray   

detectBreaches(pivotsArray) =>  
    // Detect breaches. 
    for [i, eachPoint] in pivotsArray   
        if not na(eachPoint)    
            if not eachPoint.wasBreached    
                bool hiWasBreached =     eachPoint.isHi and high[1] <= eachPoint.y and high > eachPoint.y   
                bool loWasBreached = not eachPoint.isHi and low[1]  >= eachPoint.y and low  < eachPoint.y   
                if hiWasBreached or loWasBreached   
                    // This pivot was breached; change its `wasBreached` field. 
                    point p = array.get(pivotsArray, i) 
                    p.wasBreached := true   
                    array.set(pivotsArray, i, p)    

drawLabels(pivotsArray) =>  
    for eachPoint in pivotsArray    
        if not na(eachPoint)    
            label.new(  
              eachPoint.x,  
              eachPoint.y,  
              str.tostring(eachPoint.y, format.mintick),    
              xloc.bar_time,    
              color = eachPoint.wasBreached ? color.gray : eachPoint.isHi ? color.teal : color.red, 
              style = eachPoint.isHi ? label.style_label_down: label.style_label_up,    
              textcolor = eachPoint.wasBreached ? color.silver : color.white)   

// @function        Displays a label for each of the last `qtyLabels` pivots.   
//                  Colors high pivots in green, low pivots in red, and breached pivots in gray.    
// @param qtyLabels (simple int) Quantity of last labels to display.    
// @param leftLegs  (simple int) Left pivot legs.   
// @param rightLegs (simple int) Right pivot legs.  
// @returns         Nothing.    
export drawPivots(int qtyLabels, int leftLegs, int rightLegs) =>    
    // Gather pivots as they occur. 
    pointsArray = fillPivotsArray(qtyLabels, leftLegs, rightLegs)   

    // Mark breached pivots.    
    detectBreaches(pointsArray) 

    // Draw labels once.    
    if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory  
        drawLabels(pointsArray) 

// Example use of the function. 
drawPivots(20, 10, 5)
```

If the TradingView user published the above library, it could be used
like this:

```
//@version=6  
indicator("") 
import TradingView/PivotLabels/1 as dpl   
dpl.drawPivots(20, 10, 10)
```

### [Enum types](https://www.tradingview.com#enum-types)

Libraries can also export
[enum types](#enum-types), allowing other scripts to import sets of predefined, named
values that help control the values accepted by variables, conditional
expressions, and
[collections](#collections).

For example, this library exports a `State` enum with three fields
representing distinct signal states: `long`, `short`, and `neutral`.
These fields represent the *possible values* a variable, expression, or
collection of the
[enum type](#enum-types) can take on:

```
//@version=6
library("Signal")

//@enum           An enumeration of named signal states.
//@field long     Represents a "Long" signal.
//@field short    Represents a "Short" signal.
//@field neutral  Represents a "Neutral" signal. 
export enum State
    long    = "Long"
    short   = "Short"
    neutral = "Neutral"
```

A script that imports this library can use the members (values) of the
`State` enum as named states in its logic. Here, we show a simple,
hypothetical script that imports the "Signal" library published by the
`userName` user and uses the `Signal.State` enum to assign one of three
possible values to a `mySignal` variable:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")

import userName/Signal/1 as Signal

// Calculate the median and quarter range values. 
float medianValue = ta.median(close, 100)
float rangeValue  = ta.range(close, 100) * 0.25
// Calculate upper and lower channel values.
float upper = medianValue + rangeValue
float lower = medianValue - rangeValue

//@variable Returns `Signal.State.long`, `Signal.State.short`, or `Signal.State.neutral` based on the price action.
Signal.State mySignal = switch
    close > upper => Signal.State.long
    close < lower => Signal.State.short
    =>               Signal.State.neutral

plot(close, color = mySignal == Signal.State.long ? color.green : mySignal == Signal.State.short ? color.red : na)
```

Similar to exporting [UDTs](#user-defined-types-and-objects), a library **must** export an enum when its exported
functions or methods accept or return the
[enum's](#enums) members, or when the
fields of an exported
[UDT](#user-defined-types)
accept values of that
[enum type](#enum-types).

## [Publishing a library](https://www.tradingview.com#publishing-a-library)

Before you or other Pine Script™ programmers can reuse any library, it
must be published. If you want to share your library with all
TradingViewers, publish it publicly. To use it privately, use a private
publication. As with indicators or strategies, the active chart when you
publish a library will appear in both its widget (the small placeholder
denoting libraries in the TradingView scripts stream) and script page
(the page users see when they click on the widget).

Private libraries can be used in public Protected or Invite-only
scripts.

After adding our example library to the chart and setting up a clean
chart showing our library plots the way we want them, we use the Pine
Editor's "Publish Script" button. The "Publish Library" window
comes up:

![image](images/Libraries-CreatingALibrary-PublishWindow.DrHv_-QJ_Z2mzOSu.png)

Note that:

- We leave the library's title as is (the `title` argument in our
  [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library)
  declaration statement is used as the default). While you can change
  the publication's title, it is preferable to keep its default value
  because the `title` argument is used to reference imported libraries
  in the
  [import](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_import)
  statement. It makes life easier for library users when your
  publication's title matches the actual name of the library.
- A default description is built from the
  [compiler annotations](#compiler-annotations) we used in our library. We will publish the library
  wihout retouching it.
- We chose to publish our library publicly, so it will be visible to
  all TradingViewers.
- We do not have the possibility of selecting a visibility type other
  than "Open" because libraries are always open-source.
- The list of categories for libraries is different than for
  indicators and strategies. We have selected the "Statistics and
  Metrics" category.
- We have added some custom tags: "all-time", "high" and "low".

The intended users of public libraries being other Pine programmers; the
better you explain and document your library's functions, the more
chances others will use them. Providing examples demonstrating how to
use your library's functions in your publication's code will also
help.

### [House Rules](https://www.tradingview.com#house-rules)

Pine libraries are considered "public domain" code in our [House Rules
on Script
Publishing](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599),
which entails that permission is not required from their author if you
call their functions or reuse their code in your open-source scripts.
However, if you intend to reuse code from a Pine Script™ library's
functions in a public protected or invite-only publication, explicit
permission for reuse in that form is required from its author.

Whether using a library's functions or reusing its code, you must
credit the author in your publication's description. It is also good
form to credit in open-source comments.

## [Using a library](https://www.tradingview.com#using-a-library)

Using a library from another script (which can be an indicator, a
strategy or another library), is done through the
[import](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_import)
statement:

```
import <username>/<libraryName>/<libraryVersion> [as <alias>]
```

where:

- The <username>/<libraryName>/<libraryVersion> path will
  uniquely identify the library.
- The <libraryVersion> must be specified explicitly. To ensure the
  reliability of scripts using libraries, there is no way to
  automatically use the latest version of a library. Every time a
  library update is published by its author, the library's version
  number increases. If you intend to use the latest version of the
  library, the <libraryVersion> value will require updating in the
  [import](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_import)
  statement.
- The `as <alias>` part is optional. When used, it defines the
  namespace that will refer to the library's functions. For example,
  if you import a library using the `allTime` alias as we do in the
  example below, you will refer to that library's functions as
  `allTime.<function_mame>()`. When no alias is defined, the
  library's name becomes its namespace.

To use the library we published in the previous section, our next script
will require an
[import](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_import)
statement:

```
import PineCoders/AllTimeHighLow/1 as allTime
```

As you type the user name of the library's author, you can use the
Editor's `ctrl` +
`space` / `cmd` "Auto-complete"
command to display a popup providing selections that match the available
libraries:

![image](images/Libraries-UsingALibrary-1.PrDno7wM_ZsSrb9.png)

This is an indicator that reuses our library:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Using AllTimeHighLow library", "", true)
import PineCoders/AllTimeHighLow/1 as allTime

plot(allTime.hi())
plot(allTime.lo())
plot(allTime.hi(close))
```

Note that:

- We have chosen to use the "allTime" alias for the library's
  instance in our script. When typing that alias in the Editor, a
  popup will appear to help you select the particular function you
  want to use from the library.
- We use the library's `hi()` and `lo()` functions without an
  argument, so the default
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
  and
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
  built-in variables will be used for their series, respectively.
- We use a second call to `allTime.hi()`, but this time using
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  as its argument, to plot the highest
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  in the chart's history.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Lines and boxes

# [Lines and boxes](https://www.tradingview.com#lines-and-boxes)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ facilitates drawing lines, boxes, and other geometric
formations from code using the
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
and
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
types. These types provide utility for programmatically drawing support
and resistance levels, trend lines, price ranges, and other custom
formations on a chart.

Unlike [plots](#plots), the
flexibility of these types makes them particularly well-suited for
visualizing current calculated data at virtually any available point on
the chart, irrespective of the chart bar the script executes on.

[Lines](#lines),
[boxes](#boxes), and
[polylines](#polylines)
are *objects*, like
[labels](#labels),
[tables](#tables), and other *special
types*. Scripts reference objects of these types using IDs, which act
like *pointers*. As with other objects,
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
and
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
IDs are qualified as "series" values, and all functions that manage
these objects accept "series" arguments.

Lines drawn by a script may be vertical, horizontal, or angled. Boxes
are always rectangular. Polylines sequentially connect multiple
vertical, horizontal, angled, or curved line segments. Although all of
these drawing types have different characteristics, they do have some
things in common:

- [Lines](#lines),
  [boxes](#boxes), and
  [polylines](#polylines) can have coordinates at any available location on the
  chart, including ones at future times beyond the last chart bar.
- Objects of these types can use
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  instances to set their coordinates.
- The x-coordinates of each object can be bar index or time values,
  depending on their specified `xloc` property.
- Each object can have one of multiple predefined line styles.
- Scripts can call the functions that manage these objects from within
  the scopes of [loops](#loops) and
  [conditional structures](#conditional-structures), allowing iterative and conditional control of their
  drawings.
- There are limits on the number of these objects that a script can
  reference and display on the chart. A single script instance can
  display up to 500 lines, 500 boxes, and 100 polylines. Users can
  specify the maximum number allowed for each type via the
  `max_lines_count`, `max_boxes_count`, and `max_polylines_count`
  parameters of the script's
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  or
  [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
  declaration statement. If unspecified, the default is ~50. As with
  [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
  and
  [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
  types, lines, boxes, and polylines utilize a *garbage collection*
  mechanism that deletes the oldest objects on the chart when the
  total number of drawings exceeds the script's limit.

## [Lines](https://www.tradingview.com#lines)

The built-ins in the `line.*` namespace control the creation and
management of
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
objects:

- The
  [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
  function creates a new line.
- The `line.set_*()` functions modify line properties.
- The `line.get_*()` functions retrieve values from a line instance.
- The
  [line.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.copy)
  function clones a line instance.
- The
  [line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete)
  function deletes an existing line instance.
- The
  [line.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_line.all)
  variable references a read-only
  [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
  containing the IDs of all lines displayed by the script. The
  array's
  [size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
  depends on the `max_lines_count` of the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  or
  [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
  declaration statement and the number of lines the script has drawn.

Scripts can call `line.set_*()`, `line.get_*()`,
[line.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.copy),
and
[line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete)
built-ins as functions or [methods](#methods).

### [Creating lines](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-lines)

The
[line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
function creates a new
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
instance to display on the chart. It has the following signatures:

```
line.new(first_point, second_point, xloc, extend, color, style, width, force_overlay) → series line
line.new(x1, y1, x2, y2, xloc, extend, color, style, width, force_overlay) → series line
```

The first overload of this function contains the `first_point` and
`second_point` parameters. The `first_point` is a
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
representing the start of the line, and the `second_point` is a
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
representing the line's end. The function copies the information from
these
[chart points](#chart-points) to determine the line's coordinates. Whether it uses the
`index` or `time` fields from the `first_point` and `second_point` as
x-coordinates depends on the function's `xloc` value.

The second overload specifies `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` values
independently, where `x1` and `x2` are
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
values representing the starting and ending x-coordinates of the line,
and `y1` and `y2` are
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
values representing the y-coordinates. Whether the line considers the
`x` values as bar indices or timestamps depends on the `xloc` value in
the function call.

Both overloads share the same additional parameters:

`xloc`

Controls whether the x-coordinates of the new line use bar index or
time values. Its default value is
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index).

When calling the first overload, using an `xloc` value of
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index)
tells the function to use the `index` fields of the `first_point`
and `second_point`, and a value of
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time)
tells the function to use the `time` fields of the points.

When calling the second overload, an `xloc` value of
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index)
prompts the function to treat the `x1` and `x2` arguments as bar
index values. When using
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time),
the function will treat `x1` and `x2` as time values.

When the specified x-coordinates represent *bar index* values, it's
important to note that the minimum x-coordinate allowed is
`bar_index - 9999`. For larger offsets, one can use
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time).

`extend`

Determines whether the drawn line will infinitely extend beyond its
defined start and end coordinates. It accepts one of the following
values:
[extend.left](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.left),
[extend.right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.right),
[extend.both](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.both),
or
[extend.none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.none)
(default).

`color`

Specifies the color of the line drawing. The default is
[color.blue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.blue).

`style`

Specifies the line's style, which can be any of the options listed
in this page's
[Line styles](#line-styles) section. The default value is
[line.style_solid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_line.style_solid).

`width`

Controls the width of the line, in pixels. The default value is 1.

`force_overlay`

If `true`, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is `false`.

The example below demonstrates how one can draw lines in their simplest
form. This script draws a new vertical line connecting the
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
and
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
prices at the horizontal center of each chart bar:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Lines-Creating-lines-1.B2RdyvXG_1Vqnm2.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Creating lines demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The `chart.point` for the start of the line. Contains `index` and `time` information.
firstPoint = chart.point.now(open)
//@variable The `chart.point` for the end of the line. Contains `index` and `time` information.
secondPoint = chart.point.now(close)

// Draw a basic line with a `width` of 5 connecting the `firstPoint` to the `secondPoint`.
// This line uses the `index` field from each point for its x-coordinates.
line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, width = 5)

// Color the background on the unconfirmed bar.
bgcolor(barstate.isconfirmed ? na : color.new(color.orange, 70), title = "Unconfirmed bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- If the `firstPoint` and `secondPoint` reference identical
  coordinates, the script will *not* display a line since there is
  no distance between them to draw. However, the line ID will
  still exist.
- The script will only display approximately the last 50 lines on
  the chart, as it does not have a specified `max_lines_count` in
  the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function call. Line drawings persist on the chart until deleted
  using
  [line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete)
  or removed by the garbage collector.
- The script *redraws* the line on the open chart bar (i.e., the
  bar with an orange background highlight) until it closes. After
  the bar closes, it will no longer update the drawing.

Let's look at a more involved example. This script uses the previous
bar's
[hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2)
price and the current bar's
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
prices to draw a fan with a user-specified number of lines projecting a
range of hypothetical price values for the following chart bar. It calls
[line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
within a [for](#for-loops) loop to
create `linesPerBar` lines on each bar:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Lines-Creating-lines-2.DqR4SD_f_2jEAVG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Creating lines demo", "Simple projection fan", true, max_lines_count = 500)

//@variable The number of fan lines drawn on each chart bar.
int linesPerBar = input.int(20, "Line drawings per bar", 2, 100)

//@variable The distance between each y point on the current bar.
float step = (high - low) / (linesPerBar - 1)

//@variable The `chart.point` for the start of each line. Does not contain `time` information.
firstPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index - 1, hl2[1])
//@variable The `chart.point` for the end of each line. Does not contain `time` information.
secondPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index + 1, float(na))

//@variable The stepped y value on the current bar for `secondPoint.price` calculation, starting from the `low`.
float barValue = low
// Loop to draw the fan.
for i = 1 to linesPerBar
    // Update the `price` of the `secondPoint` using the difference between the `barValue` and `firstPoint.price`.
    secondPoint.price := 2.0 * barValue - firstPoint.price
    //@variable Is `color.aqua` when the line's slope is positive, `color.fuchsia` otherwise.
    color lineColor = secondPoint.price > firstPoint.price ? color.aqua : color.fuchsia
    // Draw a new `lineColor` line connecting the `firstPoint` and `secondPoint` coordinates.
    // This line uses the `index` field from each point for its x-coordinates.
    line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, color = lineColor)
    // Add the `step` to the `barValue`.
    barValue += step

// Color the background on the unconfirmed bar.
bgcolor(barstate.isconfirmed ? na : color.new(color.orange, 70), title = "Unconfirmed bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- We've included `max_lines_count = 500` in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function call, meaning the script preserves up to 500 lines on
  the chart.
- Each
  [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
  call *copies* the information from the
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  referenced by the `firstPoint` and `secondPoint` variables. As
  such, the script can change the `price` field of the
  `secondPoint` on each loop iteration without affecting the
  y-coordinates in other lines.

### [Modifying lines](https://www.tradingview.com#modifying-lines)

The `line.*` namespace contains multiple *setter* functions that modify
the properties of
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
instances:

- [line.set_first_point()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_first_point)
  and
  [line.set_second_point()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_second_point)
  respectively update the start and end points of the `id` line using
  information from the specified `point`.
- [line.set_x1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_x1)
  and
  [line.set_x2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_x2)
  set one of the x-coordinates of the `id` line to a new `x` value,
  which can represent a bar index or time value depending on the
  line's `xloc` property.
- [line.set_y1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_y1)
  and
  [line.set_y2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_y2)
  set one of the y-coordinates of the `id` line to a new `y` value.
- [line.set_xy1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_xy1)
  and
  [line.set_xy2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_xy2)
  update one of the `id` line's points with new `x` and `y` values.
- [line.set_xloc()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_xloc)
  sets the `xloc` of the `id` line and updates both of its
  x-coordinates with new `x1` and `x2` values.
- [line.set_extend()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_extend)
  sets the `extend` property of the `id` line.
- [line.set_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_color)
  updates the `id` line's `color` value.
- [line.set_style()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_style)
  changes the `style` of the `id` line.
- [line.set_width()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_width)
  sets the `width` of the `id` line.

All setter functions directly modify the `id` line passed into the call
and do not return any value. Each setter function accepts "series"
arguments, as a script can change a line's properties throughout its
execution.

The following example draws lines connecting the opening price of a
`timeframe` to its closing price. The script uses the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword to declare the `periodLine` and the variables that reference
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
values (`openPoint` and `closePoint`) only on the *first* chart bar, and
it assigns new values to these variables over its execution. After
detecting a
[change](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change)
on the `timeframe`, it sets the `color` of the existing `periodLine`
using
[line.set_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_color),
creates new values for the `openPoint` and `closePoint` using
[chart.point.now()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.now),
then assigns a [new
line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
using those points to the `periodLine`.

On other bars where the `periodLine` value is not
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), the
script assigns a new
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
to the `closePoint`, then uses
[line.set_second_point()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_second_point)
and
[line.set_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_color)
as [methods](#methods) to update the
line's properties:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Lines-Modifying-lines-1.9MbH8maN_1T4Dvi.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Modifying lines demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The size of each period.
string timeframe = input.timeframe("D", "Timeframe")

//@variable A line connecting the period's opening and closing prices.
var line periodLine = na

//@variable The first point of the line. Contains `time` and `index` information.
var chart.point openPoint = chart.point.now(open)
//@variable The closing point of the line. Contains `time` and `index` information.
var chart.point closePoint = chart.point.now(close)

if timeframe.change(timeframe)
    //@variable The final color of the `periodLine`.
    color finalColor = switch
        closePoint.price > openPoint.price => color.green
        closePoint.price < openPoint.price => color.red
        =>                                    color.gray

    // Update the color of the current `periodLine` to the `finalColor`.
    line.set_color(periodLine, finalColor)

    // Assign new points to the `openPoint` and `closePoint`.
    openPoint  := chart.point.now(open)
    closePoint := chart.point.now(close)
    // Assign a new line to the `periodLine`. Uses `time` fields from the `openPoint` and `closePoint` as x-coordinates.
    periodLine := line.new(openPoint, closePoint, xloc.bar_time, style = line.style_arrow_right, width = 3)

else if not na(periodLine)
    // Assign a new point to the `closePoint`.
    closePoint := chart.point.now(close)

    //@variable The color of the developing `periodLine`.
    color developingColor = switch
        closePoint.price > openPoint.price => color.aqua
        closePoint.price < openPoint.price => color.fuchsia
        =>                                    color.gray

    // Update the coordinates of the line's second point using the new `closePoint`.
    // It uses the `time` field from the point for its new x-coordinate.
    periodLine.set_second_point(closePoint)
    // Update the color of the line using the `developingColor`.
    periodLine.set_color(developingColor)
```

Note that:

- Each line drawing in this example uses the
  [line.style_arrow_right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_line.style_arrow_right)
  style. See the
  [Line styles](#line-styles) section below for an overview of all available style
  settings.

### [Line styles](https://www.tradingview.com#line-styles)

Users can control the style of their scripts' line drawings by passing
one of the following variables as the `style` argument in their
[line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
or
[line.set_style()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_style)
function calls:

ArgumentLine`line.style_solid`![line_style_solid](images/LinesAndBoxes-LineStyles-solid.DhD1RUy8_12kPg2.png)`line.style_dotted`![line_style_dotted](images/LinesAndBoxes-LineStyles-dotted.ChjUGoWk_Z25Ho6S.png)`line.style_dashed`![line_style_dashed](images/LinesAndBoxes-LineStyles-dashed.RIt4NsM6_DFkrB.png)`line.style_arrow_left`![line_style_arrow_left](images/LinesAndBoxes-LineStyles-arrow_left.CASIwsfy_Z1JIiS0.png)`line.style_arrow_right`![line_style_arrow_right](images/LinesAndBoxes-LineStyles-arrow_right.Ch2Ohee9_C6Kmb.png)`line.style_arrow_both`![line_style_arrow_both](images/LinesAndBoxes-LineStyles-arrow_both.CDMgsUYf_Z1hzmym.png)Note that:

- *Polylines* can also use any of these variables as their
  `line_style` value. See the
  [Creating polylines](#creating-polylines) section of this page.

### [Reading line values](https://www.tradingview.com#reading-line-values)

The `line.*` namespace includes *getter* functions, which allow a script
to retrieve values from a
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
object for further use:

- [line.get_x1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_x1)
  and
  [line.get_x2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_x2)
  respectively get the first and second x-coordinate from the `id`
  line. Whether the value returned represents a bar index or time
  value depends on the line's `xloc` property.
- [line.get_y1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_y1)
  and
  [line.get_y2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_y2)
  respectively get the `id` line's first and second y-coordinate.
- [line.get_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_price)
  retrieves the price (y-coordinate) from a line `id` at a specified
  `x` value, including at bar indices outside the line's start and
  end points. This function is only compatible with lines that use
  [xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index)
  as the `xloc` value.

The script below draws a new line upon the onset of a
[rising](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rising)
or
[falling](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.falling)
price pattern forming over `length` bars. It uses the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword to declare the `directionLine` variable on the first chart bar.
The ID assigned to the `directionLine` persists over subsequent bars
until the `newDirection` condition occurs, in which case the script
assigns a new line to the variable.

On every bar, the script calls the
[line.get_y2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_y2),
[line.get_y1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_y1),
[line.get_x2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_x2),
and
[line.get_x1()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_x1)
getters as [methods](#methods) to
retrieve values from the current `directionLine` and calculate its
`slope`, which it uses to determine the color of each drawing and plot.
It retrieves extended values of the `directionLine` from *beyond* its
second point using
[line.get_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_price)
and [plots](#plots) them on the chart:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Lines-Reading-line-values-1.C9ypOdeZ_Gv53Q.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reading line values demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars for rising and falling calculations.
int length = input.int(2, "Length", 2)

//@variable A line that's drawn whenever `hlc3` starts rising or falling over `length` bars.
var line directionLine = na

//@variable Is `true` when `hlc3` is rising over `length` bars, `false` otherwise.
bool rising = ta.rising(hlc3, length)
//@variable Is `true` when `hlc3` is falling over `length` bars, `false` otherwise.
bool falling = ta.falling(hlc3, length)
//@variable Is `true` when a rising or falling pattern begins, `false` otherwise.
bool newDirection = (rising and not rising[1]) or (falling and not falling[1])

// Update the `directionLine` when `newDirection` is `true`. The line uses the default `xloc.bar_index`.
if newDirection
    directionLine := line.new(bar_index - length, hlc3[length], bar_index, hlc3, width = 3)

//@variable The slope of the `directionLine`.
float slope = (directionLine.get_y2() - directionLine.get_y1()) / (directionLine.get_x2() - directionLine.get_x1())
//@variable The value extrapolated from the `directionLine` at the `bar_index`.
float lineValue = line.get_price(directionLine, bar_index)

//@variable Is `color.green` when the `slope` is positive, `color.red` otherwise.
color slopeColor = slope > 0 ? color.green : color.red

// Update the color of the `directionLine`.
directionLine.set_color(slopeColor)
// Plot the `lineValue`.
plot(lineValue, "Extrapolated value", slopeColor, 3, plot.style_circles)
```

Note that:

- This example calls the second overload of the
  [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
  function, which uses `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` parameters to
  define the start and end points of the line. The `x1` value is
  `length` bars behind the current
  [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index),
  and the `y1` value is the
  [hlc3](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlc3)
  value at that index. The `x2` and `y2` in the function call use
  the current bar's
  [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
  and
  [hlc3](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlc3)
  values.
- The
  [line.get_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.get_price)
  function call treats the `directionLine` as though it extends
  infinitely, regardless of its `extend` property.
- The script only displays approximately the last 50 lines on the
  chart, but the
  [plot](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  of extrapolated values spans throughout the chart's history.

### [Cloning lines](https://www.tradingview.com#cloning-lines)

Scripts can clone a line `id` and all its properties with the
[line.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.copy)
function. Any changes to the copied line instance do not affect the
original.

For example, this script creates a horizontal line at the the bar's
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
price once every `length` bars, which it assigns to a `mainLine`
variable. On all other bars, it creates a `copiedLine` using
[line.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.copy)
and calls `line.set_*()` functions to
[modify](#modifying-lines) its properties. As we see below, altering the `copiedLine`
does not affect the `mainLine` in any way:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Lines-Cloning-lines-1.C-hcIuCO_ZfTxYF.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Cloning lines demo", overlay = true, max_lines_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars between each new mainLine assignment.
int length = input.int(20, "Length", 2, 500)

//@variable The first `chart.point` used by the `mainLine`. Contains `index` and `time` information.
firstPoint = chart.point.now(open)
//@variable The second `chart.point` used by the `mainLine`. Does not contain `time` information.
secondPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index + length, open)

//@variable A horizontal line drawn at the `open` price once every `length` bars.
var line mainLine = na

if bar_index % length == 0
    // Assign a new line to the `mainLine` that connects the `firstPoint` to the `secondPoint`.
    // This line uses the `index` fields from both points as x-coordinates.
    mainLine := line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, color = color.purple, width = 2)

//@variable A copy of the `mainLine`. Changes to this line do not affect the original.
line copiedLine = line.copy(mainLine)

// Update the color, style, and second point of the `copiedLine`.
line.set_color(copiedLine, color.orange)
line.set_style(copiedLine, line.style_dotted)
line.set_second_point(copiedLine, chart.point.now(close))
```

Note that:

- The `index` field of the `secondPoint` is `length` bars beyond
  the current
  [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).
  Since the maximum x-coordinate allowed with
  [xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index)
  is `bar_index + 500`, we've set the `maxval` of the `length`
  input to 500.

### [Deleting lines](https://www.tradingview.com#deleting-lines)

To delete a line `id` drawn by a script, use the
[line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete)
function. This function removes the line instance from the script and
its drawing on the chart.

Deleting line instances is often handy when one wants to only keep a
specific number of lines on the chart at any given time or conditionally
remove drawings as a chart progresses.

For example, this script draws a horizontal line with the
[extend.right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.right)
property whenever an
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi)
crosses its
[EMA](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema).

The script stores all line IDs in a `lines` array that it
[uses as a queue](#using-an-array-as-a-queue) to only display the last `numberOfLines` on the chart. When
the
[size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
of the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
exceeds the specified `numberOfLines`, the script removes the array's
oldest line ID using
[array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
and deletes it with
[line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete):

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Lines-Deleting-lines-1.BO7dBacB_Z1bhgfD.png)

```
//@version=6

    //@variable The color of the horizontal line.
    color lineColor = rsi > rsiMA ? color.green : color.red
    // Draw a new horizontal line. Uses the default `xloc.bar_index`.
    newLine = line.new(bar_index, rsiMA, bar_index + 1, rsiMA, extend = extend.right, color = lineColor, width = 2)
    // Push the `newLine` into the `lines` array.
    lines.push(newLine)
    // Delete the oldest line when the size of the array exceeds the specified `numberOfLines`.
    if array.size(lines) > numberOfLines
        line.delete(lines.shift())

// Plot the `rsi` and `rsiMA`.
plot(rsi, "RSI", color.new(color.blue, 40))
plot(rsiMA, "EMA of RSI", color.new(color.gray, 30))
```

Note that:

- We declared a `MAX_LINES_COUNT` variable with the "const int"
  *qualified type*, which the script uses as the `max_lines_count`
  in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function and the `maxval` of the
  [input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)
  assigned to the `numberOfLines` variable.
- This example uses the second overload of the
  [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
  function, which specifies `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` coordinates
  independently.

### [Filling the space between lines](https://www.tradingview.com#filling-the-space-between-lines)

Scripts can *fill* the space between two
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
drawings by creating a
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
object that references them with the
[linefill.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.new)
function. Linefills automatically determine their fill boundaries using
the properties from the `line1` and `line2` IDs that they reference.

For example, this script calculates a simple linear regression channel.
On the first chart bar, the script declares the `basisLine`,
`upperLine`, and `lowerLine` variables to reference the channel's
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
IDs, then it makes two
[linefill.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_linefill.new)
calls to create
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
objects that fill the upper and lower portions of the channel. The first
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
fills the space between the `basisLine` and the `upperLine`, and the
second fills the space between the `basisLine` and `lowerLine`.

The script updates the coordinates of the lines across subsequent bars.
However, notice that the script never needs to update the linefills
declared on the first bar. They automatically update their fill regions
based on the coordinates of their assigned lines:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Filling-the-space-between-lines-1.BXRTQC1Z_ZJxot8.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Filling the space between lines demo", "Simple linreg channel", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the linear regression calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(100)

//@variable The basis line of the regression channel.
var line basisLine = line.new(na, na, na, na, extend = extend.right, color = chart.fg_color, width = 2)
//@variable The channel's upper line.
var line upperLine = line.new(na, na, na, na, extend = extend.right, color = color.teal, width = 2)
//@variable The channel's lower line.
var line lowerLine = line.new(na, na, na, na, extend = extend.right, color = color.maroon, width = 2)

//@variable A linefill instance that fills the space between the `basisLine` and `upperLine`.
var linefill upperFill = linefill.new(basisLine, upperLine, color.new(color.teal, 80))
//@variable A linefill instance that fills the space between the `basisLine` and `lowerLine`.
var linefill lowerFill = linefill.new(basisLine, lowerLine, color.new(color.maroon, 80))

// Update the `basisLine` coordinates with current linear regression values.
basisLine.set_xy1(bar_index + 1 - lengthInput, ta.linreg(close, lengthInput, lengthInput - 1))
basisLine.set_xy2(bar_index, ta.linreg(close, lengthInput, 0))

//@variable The channel's standard deviation.
float stDev = 0.0
for i = 0 to lengthInput - 1
    stDev += math.pow(close[i] - line.get_price(basisLine, bar_index - i), 2)
stDev := math.sqrt(stDev / lengthInput) * 2.0

// Update the `upperLine` and `lowerLine` using the values from the `basisLine` and the `stDev`.
upperLine.set_xy1(basisLine.get_x1(), basisLine.get_y1() + stDev)
upperLine.set_xy2(basisLine.get_x2(), basisLine.get_y2() + stDev)
lowerLine.set_xy1(basisLine.get_x1(), basisLine.get_y1() - stDev)
lowerLine.set_xy2(basisLine.get_x2(), basisLine.get_y2() - stDev)
```

To learn more about the
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_linefill)
type, see [this](#line-fills)
section of the [Fills](#fills) page.

## [Boxes](https://www.tradingview.com#boxes)

The built-ins in the `box.*` namespace create and manage
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
objects:

- The
  [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
  function creates a new box.
- The `box.set_*()` functions modify box properties.
- The `box.get_*()` functions retrieve values from a box instance.
- The
  [box.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.copy)
  function clones a box instance.
- The
  [box.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.delete)
  function deletes a box instance.
- The
  [box.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_box.all)
  variable references a read-only
  [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
  containing the IDs of all boxes displayed by the script. The
  array's
  [size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
  depends on the `max_boxes_count` of the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  or
  [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
  declaration statement and the number of boxes the script has drawn.

As with [lines](#lines),
users can call `box.set_*()`, `box.get_*()`,
[box.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.copy),
and
[box.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.delete)
built-ins as functions or [methods](#methods).

### [Creating boxes](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-boxes)

The
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
function creates a new
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
object to display on the chart. It has the following signatures:

```
box.new(top_left, bottom_right, border_color, border_width, border_style, extend, xloc, bgcolor, text, text_size, text_color, text_halign, text_valign, text_wrap, text_font_family, force_overlay, text_formatting) → series box
box.new(left, top, right, bottom, border_color, border_width, border_style, extend, xloc, bgcolor, text, text_size, text_color, text_halign, text_valign, text_wrap, text_font_family, force_overlay, text_formatting) → series box
```

This function's first overload includes the `top_left` and
`bottom_right` parameters, which accept
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
objects representing the top-left and bottom-right corners of the box,
respectively. The function copies the information from these
[chart points](#chart-points) to set the coordinates of the box's corners. Whether it
uses the `index` or `time` fields of the `top_left` and `bottom_right`
points as x-coordinates depends on the function's `xloc` value.

The second overload specifies `left`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom` edges
of the box. The `left` and `right` parameters accept
[int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
values specifying the box's left and right x-coordinates, which can be
bar index or time values depending on the `xloc` value in the function
call. The `top` and `bottom` parameters accept
[float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float)
values representing the box's top and bottom y-coordinates.

The function's additional parameters are identical in both overloads:

`border_color`

Specifies the color of all four of the box's borders. The default
is
[color.blue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.blue).

`border_width`

Specifies the width of the borders, in pixels. Its default value is
1.

`border_style`

Specifies the style of the borders, which can be any of the options
in the
[Box styles](#box-styles) section of this page.

`extend`

Determines whether the box's borders extend infinitely beyond the
left or right x-coordinates. It accepts one of the following values:
[extend.left](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.left),
[extend.right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.right),
[extend.both](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.both),
or
[extend.none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_extend.none)
(default).

`xloc`

Determines whether the left and right edges of the box use bar index
or time values as x-coordinates. The default is
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index).

In the first overload, an `xloc` value of
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index)
means that the function will use the `index` fields of the
`top_left` and `bottom_right` chart points, and an `xloc` value of
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time)
means that it will use their `time` fields.

In the second overload, using an `xloc` value of
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index)
means the function treats the `left` and `right` values as bar
indices, and
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time)
means it will treat them as timestamps.

When the specified x-coordinates represent *bar index* values, it's
important to note that the minimum x-coordinate allowed is
`bar_index - 9999`. For larger offsets, one can use
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time).

`bgcolor`

Specifies the background color of the space inside the box. The
default value is
[color.blue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.blue).

`text`

The text to display inside the box. By default, its value is an
empty string.

`text_size`

Specifies the size of the text within the box. It accepts both "int" size values and "string" `size.*` constants. The "int" size can be any positive integer. The `size.*` constants and their equivalent "int" sizes are:
[size.auto](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_size.auto) (0),
[size.tiny](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_size.tiny) (8),
[size.small](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_size.small) (10),
[size.normal](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_size.normal) (14),
[size.large](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_size.large) (20),
and [size.huge](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_size.huge) (36).
The default value is [size.auto](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_size.auto).

`text_color`

Controls the color of the text. Its default is
[color.black](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.black).

`text_halign`

Specifies the horizontal alignment of the text within the box's
boundaries. It accepts one of the following:
[text.align_left](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.align_left),
[text.align_right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.align_right),
or
[text.align_center](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.align_center)
(default).

`text_valign`

Specifies the vertical alignment of the text within the box's
boundaries. It accepts one of the following:
[text.align_top](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.align_top),
[text.align_bottom](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.align_bottom),
or
[text.align_center](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.align_center)
(default).

`text_wrap`

Determines whether the box will wrap the text within it. If its
value is
[text.wrap_auto](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.wrap_auto),
the box wraps the text to ensure it does not span past its vertical
borders. It also clips the wrapped text when it extends past the
bottom. If the value is
[text.wrap_none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.wrap_none),
the box displays the text on a single line that can extend beyond
its borders. The default is
[text.wrap_none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_text.wrap_none).

`text_font_family`

Defines the font family of the box's text. Using
[font.family_default](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_font.family_default)
displays the box's text with the system's default font. The
[font.family_monospace](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_font.family_monospace)
displays the text in a monospace format. The default value is
[font.family_default](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_font.family_default).

`force_overlay`

If `true`, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is `false`.

`text_formatting`

Specifies the formatting of the box's text. Using [text.format_none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_none) displays the text with no special formatting. This parameter also accepts the arguments [text.format_bold](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_bold) or [text.format_italic](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_italic). Using `text.format_bold + text.format_italic` applies both formats together to display text that is both bold and italicized. The default value is [text.format_none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_none).

Let's write a simple script to display boxes on a chart. The example
below draws a box projecting each bar's
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
values from the horizontal center of the current bar to the center of
the next available bar.

On each bar, the script creates `topLeft` and `bottomRight` points via
[chart.point.now()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.now)
and
[chart.point_from_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.from_index),
then calls
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
to construct a new box and display it on the chart. It also highlights
the background on the unconfirmed chart bar using
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
to indicate that it redraws that box until the bar's last update:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Boxes-Creating-boxes-1.BfHkiDpJ_2qyzFB.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Creating boxes demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The `chart.point` for the top-left corner of the box. Contains `index` and `time` information.
topLeft = chart.point.now(high)
//@variable The `chart.point` for the bottom-right corner of the box. Does not contain `time` information.
bottomRight = chart.point.from_index(bar_index + 1, low)

// Draw a box using the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` corner points. Uses the `index` fields as x-coordinates.
box.new(topLeft, bottomRight, color.purple, 2, bgcolor = color.new(color.gray, 70))

// Color the background on the unconfirmed bar.
bgcolor(barstate.isconfirmed ? na : color.new(color.orange, 70), title = "Unconfirmed bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- The `bottomRight` point's `index` field is one bar greater than
  the `index` in the `topLeft`. If the x-coordinates of the
  corners were equal, the script would draw a vertical line at the
  horizontal center of each bar, resembling the example in this
  page's
  [Creating lines](#creating-lines) section.
- Similar to [lines](#lines), if the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` contained
  identical coordinates, the box wouldn't display on the chart
  since there would be no space between them to draw. However, its
  ID would still exist.
- This script only displays approximately the last 50 boxes on the
  chart, as we have not specified a `max_boxes_count` in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function call.

### [Modifying boxes](https://www.tradingview.com#modifying-boxes)

Multiple *setter* functions exist in the `box.*` namespace, allowing
scripts to modify the properties of
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
objects:

- [box.set_top_left_point()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_top_left_point)
  and
  [box.set_bottom_right_point()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_bottom_right_point)
  respectively update the top-left and bottom-right coordinates of the
  `id` box using information from the specified `point`.
- [box.set_left()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_left)
  and
  [box.set_right()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_right)
  set the left or right x-coordinate of the `id` box to a new
  `left/right` value, which can be a bar index or time value depending
  on the box's `xloc` property.
- [box.set_top()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_top)
  and
  [box.set_bottom()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_bottom)
  set the top or bottom y-coordinate of the `id` box to a new
  `top/bottom` value.
- [box.set_lefttop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_lefttop)
  sets the `left` and `top` coordinates of the `id` box, and
  [box.set_rightbottom()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_rightbottom)
  sets its `right` and `bottom` coordinates.
- [box.set_border_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_border_color),
  [box.set_border_width()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_border_width)
  and
  [box.set_border_style()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_border_style)
  respectively update the `color`, `width`, and `style` of the `id`
  box's border.
- [box.set_extend()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_extend)
  sets the horizontal `extend` property of the `id` box.
- [box.set_bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_bgcolor)
  sets the color of the space inside the `id` box to a new `color`.
- [box.set_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text),
  [box.set_text_size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_size),
  [box.set_text_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_color),
  [box.set_text_halign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_halign),
  [box.set_text_valign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_valign),
  [box.set_text_wrap()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_wrap),
  [box.set_text_font_family()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_font_family),
  and [box.set_text_formatting()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_formatting)
  update the `id` box's text-related properties.

As with setter functions in the `line.*` namespace, all box setters
modify the `id` box directly without returning a value, and each setter
function accepts "series" arguments.

Note that, unlike [lines](#lines), the `box.*` namespace does not contain a setter function to
modify a box's `xloc`. Users must
[create](#creating-boxes) a new box with the desired `xloc` setting for such cases.

This example uses boxes to visualize the ranges of upward and downward
bars with the highest
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
over a user-defined `timeframe`. When the script detects a
[change](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change)
in the `timeframe`, it assigns [new
boxes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
to its `upBox` and `downBox` variables, resets its `upVolume` and
`downVolume` values, and highlights the chart background.

When an upward or downward bar's
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
exceeds the `upVolume` or `downVolume`, the script updates the
volume-tracking variables and calls
[box.set_top_left_point()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_top_left_point)
and
[box.set_bottom_right_point()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_bottom_right_point)
to update the `upBox` or `downBox` coordinates. The setters use the
information from the
[chart points](#chart-points) created with
[chart.point.now()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.now)
and
[chart.point.from_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.from_time)
to project that bar's
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
values from the current time to the [closing
time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close)
of the `timeframe`:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Boxes-Modifying-boxes-1.Bj141v5c_297ln.png)

        upVolume   := 0.0
        downVolume := volume
        // Draw a new `upBox` with `na` coordinates.
        upBox := box.new(na, na, na, na, upBorder, 3, xloc = xloc.bar_time, bgcolor = upFill)
        // Draw a new `downBox` using `time` and `price` info from the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` points.
        downBox := box.new(topLeft, bottomRight, downBorder, 3, xloc = xloc.bar_time, bgcolor = downFill)
// Update the ``upVolume`` and change the ``upBox`` coordinates when volume increases on an upward bar.
else if close > open and volume > upVolume
    upVolume := volume
    box.set_top_left_point(upBox, topLeft)
    box.set_bottom_right_point(upBox, bottomRight)
// Update the ``downVolume`` and change the ``downBox`` coordinates when volume increases on a downward bar.
else if close <= open and volume > downVolume
    downVolume := volume
    box.set_top_left_point(downBox, topLeft)
    box.set_bottom_right_point(downBox, bottomRight)

// Highlight the background when a new `timeframe` bar starts.
bgcolor(changeTF ? color.new(color.orange, 70) : na, title = "Timeframe change highlight")
```

Note that:

- The
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function call contains `max_boxes_count = 100`, meaning the
  script will preserve the last 100 boxes on the chart.
- We utilized *both overloads* of
  [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
  in this example. On the first bar of the `timeframe`, the script
  calls the first overload for the `upBox` when the bar is rising,
  and it calls that overload for the `downBox` when the bar is
  falling. It uses the second overload to assign a new box with
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values to the other box variable on that bar.

### [Box styles](https://www.tradingview.com#box-styles)

Users can include one of the following `line.style_*` variables in their
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
or
[box.set_border_style()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_border_style)
function calls to set the border styles of boxes drawn by their scripts:

ArgumentBox`line.style_solid`![box_style_solid](images/box.style_solid.DpZnFQGZ_2oQNCW.png)`line.style_dotted`![box_style_dotted](images/box.style_dotted.DQk4-fDM_Z23lye8.png)`line.style_dashed`![box_style_dashed](images/box.style_dashed.BezJLOhC_Z1FMPte.png)### [Reading box values](https://www.tradingview.com#reading-box-values)

The `box.*` namespace features *getter* functions that allow scripts to
retrieve coordinate values from a box instance:

- [box.get_left()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_left)
  and
  [box.get_right()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_right)
  respectively get the x-coordinates of the left and right edges of
  the `id` box. Whether the value returned represents a bar index or
  time value depends on the box's `xloc` property.
- [box.get_top()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_top)
  and
  [box.get_bottom()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_bottom)
  respectively get the top and bottom y-coordinates of the `id` box.

The example below draws boxes to visualize hypothetical price ranges
over a period of `length` bars. At the start of each new period, it uses
the average candle range multiplied by the `scaleFactor` input to
calculate the corner points of a box centered at the
[hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2)
price with an `initialRange` height. After drawing the first box, it
creates `numberOfBoxes - 1` new boxes inside a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)
loop.

Within each loop iteration, the script gets the `lastBoxDrawn` by
retrieving the
[last](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.last)
element from the read-only
[box.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_box.all)
array, then calls
[box.get_top()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_top)
and
[box.get_bottom()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_bottom)
to get its y-coordinates. It uses these values to calculate the
coordinates for a new box that's `scaleFactor` times taller than the
previous:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Boxes-Reading-box-values-1.BjHiyYzc_1hj7GF.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reading box values demo", "Nested boxes", overlay = true, max_boxes_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the range calculation.
int length = input.int(10, "Length", 2, 500)
//@variable The number of nested boxes drawn on each period.
int numberOfBoxes = input.int(5, "Nested box count", 1)
//@variable The scale factor applied to each box.
float scaleFactor = input.float(1.6, "Scale factor", 1)

//@variable The initial box range.
float initialRange = scaleFactor * ta.sma(high - low, length)

if bar_index % length == 0
    //@variable The top-left `chart.point` for the initial box. Does not contain `time` information.
    topLeft = chart.point.from_index(bar_index, hl2 + initialRange / 2)
    //@variable The bottom-right `chart.point` for the initial box. Does not contain `time` information.
    bottomRight = chart.point.from_index(bar_index + length, hl2 - initialRange / 2)

    // Calculate border and fill colors of the boxes.
    borderColor = color.rgb(math.random(100, 255), math.random(0, 100), math.random(100, 255))
    bgColor = color.new(borderColor, math.max(100 * (1 - 1/numberOfBoxes), 90))

    // Draw a new box using the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` points. Uses their `index` fields as x-coordinates.
    box.new(topLeft, bottomRight, borderColor, 2, bgcolor = bgColor)

    if numberOfBoxes > 1
        // Loop to create additional boxes.
        for i = 1 to numberOfBoxes - 1
            //@variable The last box drawn by the script.
            box lastBoxDrawn = box.all.last()

            //@variable The top price of the last box.
            float top = box.get_top(lastBoxDrawn)
            //@variable The bottom price of the last box.
            float bottom = box.get_bottom(lastBoxDrawn)

            //@variable The scaled range of the new box.
            float newRange = scaleFactor * (top - bottom) * 0.5

            // Update the `price` fields of the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` points.
            // This does not affect the coordinates of previous boxes.
            topLeft.price     := hl2 + newRange
            bottomRight.price := hl2 - newRange

            // Draw a new box using the updated `topLeft` and `bottomRight` points.
            box.new(topLeft, bottomRight, borderColor, 2, bgcolor = bgColor)
```

Note that:

- The
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function call uses `max_boxes_count = 500`, meaning the script
  can display up to 500 boxes on the chart.
- Each drawing has a `right` index `length` bars beyond the `left`
  index. Since the x-coordinates of these drawings can be up to
  500 bars into the future, we've set the `maxval` of the
  `length` input to 500.
- On each new period, the script uses randomized
  [color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.rgb)
  values for the `border_color` and `bgcolor` of the boxes.
- Each
  [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
  call copies the coordinates from the
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  objects assigned to the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` variables,
  which is why the script can modify their `price` fields on each
  loop iteration without affecting the other boxes.

### [Cloning boxes](https://www.tradingview.com#cloning-boxes)

To clone a specific box `id`, use
[box.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.copy).
This function copies the box and its properties. Any changes to the
copied box do not affect the original.

For example, this script declares an `originalBox` variable on the first
bar and assigns a [new
box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
to it once every `length` bars. On other bars, it uses
[box.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.copy)
to create a `copiedBox` and calls `box.set_*()` functions to
[modify](#modifying-boxes) its properties. As shown on the chart below, these changes
do not modify the `originalBox`:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Boxes-Cloning-boxes-1.C3LhZvV5_2sfgJn.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Cloning boxes demo", overlay = true, max_boxes_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars between each new mainLine assignment.
int length = input.int(20, "Length", 2)

//@variable The `chart.point` for the top-left of the `originalBox`. Contains `time` and `index` information.
topLeft = chart.point.now(high)
//@variable The `chart.point` for the bottom-right of the `originalBox`. Does not contain `time` information.
bottomRight = chart.point.from_index(bar_index + 1, low)

//@variable A new box with `topLeft` and `bottomRight` corners on every `length` bars.
var box originalBox = na

//@variable Is teal when the bar is rising, maroon when it's falling.
color originalColor = close > open ? color.teal : color.maroon

if bar_index % length == 0
    // Assign a new box using the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` info to the `originalBox`.
    // This box uses the `index` fields from the points as x-coordinates.
    originalBox := box.new(topLeft, bottomRight, originalColor, 2, bgcolor = color.new(originalColor, 60))
else
    //@variable A clone of the `originalBox`.
    box copiedBox = box.copy(originalBox)
    // Modify the `copiedBox`. These changes do not affect the `originalBox`.
    box.set_top(copiedBox, high)
    box.set_bottom_right_point(copiedBox, bottomRight)
    box.set_border_color(copiedBox, color.gray)
    box.set_border_width(copiedBox, 1)
    box.set_bgcolor(copiedBox, na)
```

### [Deleting boxes](https://www.tradingview.com#deleting-boxes)

To delete boxes drawn by a script, use
[box.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.delete).
As with `*.delete()` functions in other drawing namespaces, this
function is handy for conditionally removing boxes or maintaining a
specific number of boxes on the chart.

This example displays boxes representing periodic cumulative volume
values. The script
[creates](#creating-boxes) a new box ID and stores it in a `boxes` array once every
`length` bars. If the [array's
size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
exceeds the specified `numberOfBoxes`, the script removes the oldest box
from the array using
[array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
and deletes it using
[box.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.delete).

On other bars, it accumulates
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
over each period by
[modifying](#modifying-boxes) the `top` of the
[last](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.last)
box in the `boxes` array. The script then uses
[for loops](#for-loops) to find the
`highestTop` of all the array's boxes and set the `bgcolor` of each box
with a [gradient
color](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.from_gradient)
based on its
[box.get_top()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_top)
value relative to the `highestTop`:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Boxes-Deleting-boxes-1.CnAZt6YV_ZXP4os.png)

```
//@version=6

//@variable The maximum number of boxes to show on the chart.
const int MAX_BOXES_COUNT = 500

indicator("Deleting boxes demo", "Cumulative volume boxes", format = format.volume, max_boxes_count = MAX_BOXES_COUNT)

//@variable The number of bars in each period.
int length = input.int(20, "Length", 1)
//@variable The maximum number of volume boxes in the calculation.
int numberOfBoxes = input.int(10, "Number of boxes", 1, MAX_BOXES_COUNT)

//@variable An array containing the ID of each box displayed by the script.
var boxes = array.new<box>()

if bar_index % length == 0
    // Push a new box into the `boxes` array. The box has the default `xloc.bar_index` property.
    boxes.push(box.new(bar_index, 0, bar_index + 1, 0, #000000, 2, text_color = #000000))
    // Shift the oldest box out of the array and delete it when the array's size exceeds the `numberOfBoxes`.
    if boxes.size() > numberOfBoxes
        box.delete(boxes.shift())

//@variable The last box drawn by the script as of the current chart bar.
box lastBox = boxes.last()
// Add the current bar's volume to the top of the `lastBox` and update the `right` index.
lastBox.set_top(lastBox.get_top() + volume)
lastBox.set_right(bar_index + 1)
// Display the top of the `lastBox` as volume-formatted text.
lastBox.set_text(str.tostring(lastBox.get_top(), format.volume))

//@variable The highest `top` of all boxes in the `boxes` array.
float highestTop = 0.0
for id in boxes
    highestTop := math.max(id.get_top(), highestTop)

// Set the `bgcolor` of each `id` in `boxes` with a gradient based on the ratio of its `top` to the `highestTop`.
for id in boxes
    id.set_bgcolor(color.from_gradient(id.get_top() / highestTop, 0, 1, color.purple, color.orange))
```

Note that:

- At the top of the code, we've declared a `MAX_BOXES_COUNT`
  variable with the "const int" *qualified type*. We use this
  value as the `max_boxes_count` in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function and the maximum possible value of the `numberOfBoxes`
  input.
- This script uses the second overload of the
  [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
  function, which specifies the box's `left`, `top`, `right`, and
  `bottom` coordinates separately.
- We've included
  [format.volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_format.volume)
  as the `format` argument in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  call, which tells the script that the y-axis of the chart pane
  represents *volume* values. Each box also displays its
  [top](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.get_top)
  value as
  [volume-formatted](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_format.volume)
  text.

## [Polylines](https://www.tradingview.com#polylines)

Pine Script™ polylines are **advanced** drawings that sequentially
connect the coordinates from an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
instances using straight or *curved* line segments.

These powerful drawings can connect up to 10,000 points at any available
location on the chart, allowing scripts to draw custom series, polygons,
and other complex geometric formations that are otherwise difficult or
impossible to draw using
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
or [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
objects.

The `polyline.*` namespace features the following built-ins for creating
and managing
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
objects:

- The
  [polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
  function creates a new polyline instance.
- The
  [polyline.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.delete)
  function deletes an existing polyline instance.
- The
  [polyline.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_polyline.all)
  variable references a read-only
  [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
  containing the IDs of all polylines displayed by the script. The
  array's
  [size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
  depends on the `max_polylines_count` of the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  or
  [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
  declaration statement and the number of polylines drawn by the
  script.

Unlike [lines](#lines)
or [boxes](#boxes),
polylines do not have functions for modification or reading their
properties. To redraw a polyline on the chart, one can *delete* the
existing instance and *create* a new polyline with the desired changes.

### [Creating polylines](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-polylines)

The
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
function creates a new
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
instance to display on the chart. It has the following signature:

```
polyline.new(points, curved, closed, xloc, line_color, fill_color, line_style, line_width, force_overlay) → series polyline
```

The following eight parameters affect the behavior of a polyline
drawing:

`points`

Accepts an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
objects that determine the coordinates of each point in the
polyline. The drawing connects the coordinates from each element in
the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
sequentially, starting from the *first*. Whether the polyline uses
the `index` or `time` field from each
[chart point](#chart-points) for its x-coordinates depends on the `xloc` value in the
function call.

`curved`

Specifies whether the drawing uses curved line segments to connect
each
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
in the `points` array. The default value is `false`, meaning it uses
straight line segments.

`closed`

Controls whether the polyline will connect the last
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
in the `points` array to the first, forming a *closed polyline*. The
default value is `false`.

`xloc`

Specifies which field from each
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
in the `points` array the polyline uses for its x-coordinates. When
its value is
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index),
the function uses the `index` fields to create the polyline. When
its value is
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time),
the function uses the `time` fields. The default value is
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index).

`line_color`

Specifies the color of all line segments in the polyline drawing.
The default is `color.blue`.

`fill_color`

Controls the color of the closed space filled by the polyline
drawing. Its default value is
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

`line_style`

Specifies the style of the polyline, which can be any of the
available options in the
[Line styles](#line-styles) section of this page. The default is
[line.style_solid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_line.style_solid).

`line_width`

Specifies the width of the polyline, in pixels. The default value is
1.

`force_overlay`

If `true`, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is `false`.

This script demonstrates a simple example of drawing a polyline on the
chart. It
[pushes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
a new
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
with an alternating `price` value into a `points` array and colors the
background with
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
once every `length` bars.

On the [last confirmed historical
bar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islastconfirmedhistory),
the script draws a new polyline on the chart, connecting the coordinates
from each
[chart point](#chart-points) in the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
starting from the first:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Polylines-Creating-polylines-1.trunruUb_1O2zpI.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Creating polylines demo", "Oscillating polyline")

//@variable The number of bars between each point in the drawing.
int length = input.int(20, "Length between points", 2)

//@variable An array of `chart.point` objects to sequentially connect with a polyline.
var points = array.new<chart.point>()

//@variable The y-coordinate of each point in the `points`. Alternates between 1 and -1 on each `newPoint`.
var int yValue = 1

//@variable Is `true` once every `length` bars, `false` otherwise.
bool newPoint = bar_index % length == 0

if newPoint
    // Push a new `chart.point` into the `points`. The new point contains `time` and `index` info.
    points.push(chart.point.now(yValue))
    // Change the sign of the `yValue`.
    yValue *= -1

// Draw a new `polyline` on the last confirmed historical chart bar.
// The polyline uses the `time` field from each `chart.point` in the `points` array as x-coordinates.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    polyline.new(points, xloc = xloc.bar_time, line_color = #9151A6, line_width = 3)

// Highlight the chart background on every `newPoint` condition.
bgcolor(newPoint ? color.new(color.gray, 70) : na, title = "New point highlight")
```

Note that:

- This script uses only *one* polyline to connect each
  [chart point](#chart-points) from the
  [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
  with straight line segments, and this drawing spans throughout
  the available chart data, starting from the first bar.
- While one can achieve a similar effect using
  [lines](#lines),
  doing so would require a new
  [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
  instance on each occurrence of the `newPoint` condition, and
  such a drawing would be limited to a maximum of 500 line
  segments. This single unclosed polyline drawing, on the other
  hand, can contain up to 9,999 line segments.

#### [Curved drawings](https://www.tradingview.com#curved-drawings)

Polylines can draw *curves* that are otherwise impossible to produce
with [lines](#lines) or
[boxes](#boxes). When
enabling the `curved` parameter of the
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
function, the resulting polyline interpolates *nonlinear* values between
the coordinates from each
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
in its
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of `points` to generate a curvy effect.

For instance, the "Oscillating polyline" script in our previous
example uses *straight* line segments to produce a drawing resembling a
triangle wave, meaning a waveform that zig-zags between its peaks and
valleys. If we set the `curved` parameter in the
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
call from that example to `true`, the resulting drawing would connect
the points using *curved* segments, producing a smooth, nonlinear shape
similar to a sine wave:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Polylines-Creating-polylines-Curved-drawings-1.BWGXS3tj_10tSGQ.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Curved drawings demo", "Smooth oscillating polyline")

//@variable The number of bars between each point in the drawing.
int length = input.int(20, "Length between points", 2)

//@variable An array of `chart.point` objects to sequentially connect with a polyline.
var points = array.new<chart.point>()

//@variable The y-coordinate of each point in the `points`. Alternates between 1 and -1 on each `newPoint`.
var int yValue = 1

//@variable Is `true` once every `length` bars, `false` otherwise.
bool newPoint = bar_index % length == 0

if newPoint
    // Push a new `chart.point` into the `points`. The new point contains `time` and `index` info.
    points.push(chart.point.now(yValue))
    // Change the sign of the `yValue`.
    yValue *= -1

// Draw a new curved `polyline` on the last confirmed historical chart bar.
// The polyline uses the `time` field from each `chart.point` in the `points` array as x-coordinates.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    polyline.new(points, curved = true, xloc = xloc.bar_time, line_color = #9151A6, line_width = 3)

// Highlight the chart background on every `newPoint` condition.
bgcolor(newPoint ? color.new(color.gray, 70) : na, title = "New point highlight")
```

Notice that in this example, the smooth curves have relatively
consistent behavior, and no portion of the drawing extends past its
defined coordinates, which is not always the case when drawing curved
polylines. The data used to construct a polyline heavily impacts the
smooth, piecewise function it interpolates between its points. In some
cases, the interpolated curve *can* reach beyond its actual coordinates.

Let's add some variation to the
[chart points](#chart-points) in our example's `points` array to demonstrate this
behavior. In the version below, the script multiplies the `yValue` by a
[random](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random)
value in the
[chart.point.now()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_chart.point.now)
calls.

To visualize the behavior, this script also creates a horizontal
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
at the `price` value from each
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
in the `points` array, and it displays another polyline connecting the
same points with straight line segments. As we see on the chart, both
polylines pass through all coordinates from the `points` array. However,
the curvy polyline occasionally reaches *beyond* the vertical boundaries
indicated by the horizontal
[lines](#lines), whereas
the polyline drawn using straight segments does not:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Polylines-Creating-polylines-Curved-drawings-2.Bh30lTw9_2uiiOc.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Curved drawings demo", "Random oscillating polylines")

//@variable The number of bars between each point in the drawing.
int length = input.int(20, "Length between points", 2)

//@variable An array of `chart.point` objects to sequentially connect with a polyline.
var points = array.new<chart.point>()

//@variable The sign of each `price` in the `points`. Alternates between 1 and -1 on each `newPoint`.
var int yValue = 1

//@variable Is `true` once every `length` bars.
bool newPoint = bar_index % length == 0

if newPoint
    // Push a new `chart.point` with a randomized `price` into the `points`.
    // The new point contains `time` and `index` info.
    points.push(chart.point.now(yValue * math.random()))
    // Change the sign of the `yValue`.
    yValue *= -1

    //@variable The newest `chart.point`.
    lastPoint = points.last()
    // Draw a horizontal line at the `lastPoint.price`. This line uses the default `xloc.bar_index`.
    line.new(lastPoint.index - length, lastPoint.price, lastPoint.index + length, lastPoint.price, color = color.red)

// Draw two `polyline` instances on the last confirmed chart bar.
// Both polylines use the `time` field from each `chart.point` in the `points` array as x-coordinates.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    polyline.new(points, curved = false, xloc = xloc.bar_time, line_color = #EB8A3B, line_width = 2)
    polyline.new(points, curved = true, xloc = xloc.bar_time, line_color = #9151A6, line_width = 3)

// Highlight the chart background on every `newPoint` condition.
bgcolor(newPoint ? color.new(color.gray, 70) : na, title = "New point highlight")
```

#### [Closed shapes](https://www.tradingview.com#closed-shapes)

Since a single polyline can contain numerous straight or curved line
segments, and the `closed` parameter allows the drawing to connect the
coordinates from the first and last
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
in its
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of `points`, we can use polylines to draw many different types of closed
polygonal shapes.

Let's draw some polygons in Pine. The following script periodically
draws randomized polygons centered at
[hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2)
price values.

On each occurrence of the `newPolygon` condition, it
[clears](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.clear)
the `points` array, calculates the `numberOfSides` and `rotationOffset`
of the new polygon drawing based on
[math.random()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random)
values, then uses a [for loop](#for-loops) to push `numberOfSides` new
[chart points](#chart-points) into the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
that contain stepped coordinates from an elliptical path with `xScale`
and `yScale` semi-axes. The script draws the polygon by connecting each
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
from the `points` array using a *closed polyline* with straight line
segments:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Polylines-Creating-polylines-Closed-shapes-1.DX7VAEme_ZOQPTt.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Closed shapes demo", "N-sided polygons", true)

//@variable The size of the horizontal semi-axis.
float xScale = input.float(3.0, "X scale", 1.0)
//@variable The size of the vertical semi-axis.
float yScale = input.float(1.0, "Y scale") * ta.atr(2)

//@variable An array of `chart.point` objects containing vertex coordinates.
var points = array.new<chart.point>()

//@variable The condition that triggers a new polygon drawing. Based on the horizontal axis to prevent overlaps.
bool newPolygon = bar_index % int(math.round(2 * xScale)) == 0 and barstate.isconfirmed

if newPolygon
    // Clear the `points` array.
    points.clear()

    //@variable The number of sides and vertices in the new polygon.
    int numberOfSides = int(math.random(3, 7))
    //@variable A random rotation offset applied to the new polygon, in radians.
    float rotationOffset = math.random(0.0, 2.0) * math.pi
    //@variable The size of the angle between each vertex, in radians.
    float step = 2 * math.pi / numberOfSides

    //@variable The counter-clockwise rotation angle of each vertex.
    float angle = rotationOffset

    for i = 1 to numberOfSides
        //@variable The approximate x-coordinate from an ellipse at the `angle`, rounded to the nearest integer.
        int xValue = int(math.round(xScale * math.cos(angle))) + bar_index
        //@variable The y-coordinate from an ellipse at the `angle`.
        float yValue = yScale * math.sin(angle) + hl2

        // Push a new `chart.point` containing the `xValue` and `yValue` into the `points` array.
        // The new point does not contain `time` information.
        points.push(chart.point.from_index(xValue, yValue))
        // Add the `step` to the `angle`.
        angle += step

    // Draw a closed polyline connecting the `points`.
    // The polyline uses the `index` field from each `chart.point` in the `points` array.
    polyline.new(
         points, closed = true, line_color = color.navy, fill_color = color.new(color.orange, 50), line_width = 3
     )
```

Note that:

- This example shows the last ~50 polylines on the chart, as we
  have not specified a `max_polylines_count` value in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function call.
- The `yScale` calculation multiplies an
  [input.float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.float)
  by
  [ta.atr(2)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.atr)
  to adapt the vertical scale of the drawings to recent price
  ranges.
- The resulting polygons have a maximum width of twice the
  horizontal semi-axis (`2 * xScale`), rounded to the nearest
  integer. The `newPolygon` condition uses this value to prevent
  the polygon drawings from overlapping.
- The script rounds the `xValue` calculation to the nearest
  integer because the `index` field of a
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  only accepts an
  [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
  value, as the x-axis of the chart does not include fractional
  bar indices.

### [Deleting polylines](https://www.tradingview.com#deleting-polylines)

To delete a specific polyline `id`, use
[polyline.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.delete).
This function removes the
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
object from the script and its drawing on the chart.

As with other drawing objects, we can use
[polyline.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.delete)
to maintain a specific number of polyline drawings or conditionally
remove drawings from a chart.

For example, the script below periodically draws approximate arithmetic
spirals and stores their polyline IDs in an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
which it
[uses as a queue](#using-an-array-as-a-queue) to manage the number of drawings it displays.

When the `newSpiral` condition occurs, the script creates a `points`
array and adds
[chart points](#chart-points) within a [for loop](#for-loops). On each loop iteration, it calls the `spiralPoint()`[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) to create a new
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
containing stepped values from an elliptical path that grows with
respect to the `angle`. The script then creates a randomly colored
*curved polyline* connecting the coordinates from the `points` and
[pushes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
its ID into the `polylines` array.

When the array's
[size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
exceeds the specified `numberOfSpirals`, the script removes the oldest
polyline using
[array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift)
and deletes the object using
[polyline.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.delete):

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Polylines-Deleting-polylines-1.CAlL6dPB_1NJJpi.png)

```
//@version=6

//@variable The maximum number of polylines allowed on the chart.
const int MAX_POLYLINES_COUNT = 100

indicator("Deleting polylines example", "Spirals", true, max_polylines_count = MAX_POLYLINES_COUNT)

//@variable The number of spiral drawings on the chart.
int numberOfSpirals = input.int(10, "Spirals shown", 1, MAX_POLYLINES_COUNT)
//@variable The number of full spiral rotations to draw.
int rotations = input.int(5, "Rotations", 1)
//@variable The scale of the horizontal semi-axis.
float xScale = input.float(1.0, "X scale")
//@variable The scale of the vertical semi-axis.
float yScale = input.float(0.2, "Y scale") * ta.atr(2)

//@function Calculates an approximate point from an elliptically-scaled arithmetic spiral.
//@returns  A `chart.point` with `index` and `price` information.
spiralPoint(float angle, int xOffset, float yOffset) =>
    result = chart.point.from_index(
         int(math.round(angle * xScale * math.cos(angle))) + xOffset,
         angle * yScale * math.sin(angle) + yOffset
     )

//@variable An array of polylines.
var polylines = array.new<polyline>()

//@variable The condition to create a new spiral.
bool newSpiral = bar_index % int(math.round(4 * math.pi * rotations * xScale)) == 0

if newSpiral
    //@variable An array of `chart.point` objects for the `spiral` drawing.
    points = array.new<chart.point>()
    //@variable The counter-clockwise angle between calculated points, in radians.
    float step = math.pi / 2
    //@variable The rotation angle of each calculated point on the spiral, in radians.
    float theta = 0.0
    // Loop to create the spiral's points. Creates 4 points per full rotation.
    for i = 0 to rotations * 4
        //@variable A new point on the calculated spiral.
        chart.point newPoint = spiralPoint(theta, bar_index, ohlc4)
        // Add the `newPoint` to the `points` array.
        points.push(newPoint)
        // Add the `step` to the `theta` angle.
        theta += step

    //@variable A random color for the new `spiral` drawing.
    color spiralColor = color.rgb(math.random(150, 255), math.random(0, 100), math.random(150, 255))
    //@variable A new polyline connecting the spiral points. Uses the `index` field from each point as x-coordinates.
    polyline spiral = polyline.new(points, true, line_color = spiralColor, line_width = 3)

    // Push the new `spiral` into the `polylines` array.
    polylines.push(spiral)
    // Shift the first polyline out of the array and delete it when the array's size exceeds the `numberOfSpirals`.
    if polylines.size() > numberOfSpirals
        polyline.delete(polylines.shift())

// Highlight the background when `newSpiral` is `true`.
bgcolor(newSpiral ? color.new(color.blue, 70) : na, title = "New drawing highlight")
```

Note that:

- We declared a `MAX_POLYLINES_COUNT` global variable with a
  constant value of 100. The script uses this constant as the
  `max_polylines_count` value in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function and the `maxval` of the `numberOfSpirals` input.
- As with our "N-sided polygons" example in the
  [previous section](#closed-shapes), we round the calculation of x-coordinates to the
  nearest integer since the `index` field of a
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  can only accept an
  [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int)
  value.
- Despite the smooth appearance of the drawings, each polyline's
  `points` array only contains *four*[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
  objects per spiral rotation. Since the
  [polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
  call includes `curved = true`, each polyline uses *smooth
  curves* to connect their `points`, producing a visual
  approximation of the spiral's actual curvature.
- The width of each spiral is approximately
  `4 * math.pi * rotations * xScale`, rounded to the nearest
  integer. We use this value in the `newSpiral` condition to space
  each drawing and prevent overlaps.

### [Redrawing polylines](https://www.tradingview.com#redrawing-polylines)

It may be desirable in some cases to change a polyline drawing
throughout a script's execution. While the `polyline.*` namespace does
not contain built-in setter functions, we can *redraw* polylines
referenced by variables or
[collections](#collections) by *deleting* the existing polylines and assigning *new
instances* with the desired changes.

The following example uses
[polyline.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.delete)
and
[polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
calls to update the value of a polyline variable.

This script draws closed polylines that connect the open, high, low, and
close points of periods containing `length` bars. It creates a
`currentDrawing` variable on the first bar and assigns a polyline ID to
it on every chart bar. It uses the `openPoint`, `highPoint`, `lowPoint`,
and `closePoint` variables to reference
[chart points](#chart-points) that track the period's developing OHLC values. As new
values emerge, the script assigns new
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
objects to the variables, collects them in an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
using
[array.from](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.from),
then creates a [new
polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_polyline.new)
connecting the coordinates from the array's points and assigns it to
the `currentDrawing`.

When the `newPeriod` condition is `false` (i.e., the current period is
not complete), the script
[deletes](#deleting-polylines) the polyline referenced by the `currentDrawing` before
[creating a new one](#creating-polylines), resulting in a dynamic drawing that changes over the
developing period:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Polylines-Redrawing-polylines-1.CzU1g71o_2i3aBU.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Redrawing polylines demo", "OHLC polygons", true, max_polylines_count = 100)

//@variable The length of the period.
int length = input.int(100, "Length", 1)

//@variable A `chart.point` representing the start of each period.
var chart.point openPoint = na
//@variable A `chart.point` representing the highest point of each period.
var chart.point highPoint = na
//@variable A `chart.point` representing the lowest point of each period.
var chart.point lowPoint = na
//@variable A `chart.point` representing the current bar's closing point.
closePoint = chart.point.now(close)

//@variable The current period's polyline drawing.
var polyline currentDrawing = na

//@variable Is `true` once every `length` bars.
bool newPeriod = bar_index % length == 0

if newPeriod
    // Assign new chart points to the `openPoint`, `highPoint`, and `closePoint`.
    openPoint := chart.point.now(open)
    highPoint := chart.point.now(high)
    lowPoint  := chart.point.now(low)
else
    // Assign a new `chart.point` to the `highPoint` when the `high` is greater than its `price`.
    if high > highPoint.price
        highPoint := chart.point.now(high)
    // Assign a new `chart.point` to the `lowPoint` when the `low` is less than its `price`.
    if low < lowPoint.price
        lowPoint := chart.point.now(low)

//@variable Is teal when the `closePoint.price` is greater than the `openPoint.price`, maroon otherwise.
color drawingColor = closePoint.price > openPoint.price ? color.teal : color.maroon

// Delete the polyline assigned to the `currentDrawing` if it's not a `newPeriod`.
if not newPeriod
    polyline.delete(currentDrawing)
// Assign a new polyline to the `currentDrawing`.
// Uses the `index` field from each `chart.point` in its array as x-coordinates.
currentDrawing := polyline.new(
     array.from(openPoint, highPoint, closePoint, lowPoint), closed = true,
     line_color = drawingColor, fill_color = color.new(drawingColor, 60)
 )
```

## [Realtime behavior](https://www.tradingview.com#realtime-behavior)

[Lines](#lines),
[boxes](#boxes), and
[polylines](#polylines)
are subject to both *commit* and *rollback* actions, which affect the
behavior of a script when it executes on a realtime bar. See the page on
Pine Script™'s [Execution model](#execution-model).

This script demonstrates the effect of rollback when it executes on the
realtime, *unconfirmed* chart bar:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Realtime-behavior-1.CJQjybQE_1WvIDG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Realtime behavior demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Is orange when the `line` is subject to rollback and gray after the `line` is committed.
color lineColor = barstate.isconfirmed ? color.gray : color.orange

line.new(bar_index, hl2, bar_index + 1, hl2, color = lineColor, width = 4)
```

The
[line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new)
call in this example creates a new
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
ID on each iteration when values change on the unconfirmed bar. The
script automatically deletes the objects created on each change in that
bar because of the *rollback* before each iteration. It only *commits*
the last line created before the bar closes, and that
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
instance is the one that persists on the confirmed bar.

## [Limitations](https://www.tradingview.com#limitations)

### [Total number of objects](https://www.tradingview.com#total-number-of-objects)

[Lines](#lines),
[boxes](#boxes), and
[polylines](#polylines)
consume server resources, which is why there are limits on the total
number of drawings per script. When a script creates more drawing
objects than the allowed limit, the Pine Script™ runtime automatically
deletes the oldest ones in a process referred to as *garbage
collection*.

A single script can contain up to 500 lines, 500 boxes, and 100
polylines. Users can control the garbage collection limits by specifying
the `max_lines_count`, `max_boxes_count`, and `max_polylines_count`
values in their script's
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
or
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
declaration statement.

This script demonstrates how garbage collection works in Pine. It
creates a new line, box, and polyline on each chart bar. We haven't
specified values for the `max_lines_count`, `max_boxes_count`, or
`max_polylines_count` parameters in the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
function call, so the script will maintain the most recent ~50 lines,
boxes, and polylines on the chart, as this is the default setting for
each parameter:

![image](images/Lines-and-boxes-Limitations-Total-number-of-objects-1.BBu4sL-b_2tzxSR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Garbage collection demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A new `chart.point` at the current `bar_index` and `high`.
firstPoint = chart.point.now(high)
//@variable A new `chart.point` one bar into the future at the current `low`.
secondPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index + 1, low)
//@variable A new `chart.point` one bar into the future at the current `high`.
thirdPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index + 1, high)

// Draw a new `line` connecting the `firstPoint` to the `secondPoint`.
line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, color = color.red, width = 2)
// Draw a new `box` with the `firstPoint` top-left corner and `secondPoint` bottom-right corner.
box.new(firstPoint, secondPoint, color.purple, 2, bgcolor = na)
// Draw a new `polyline` connecting the `firstPoint`, `secondPoint`, and `thirdPoint` sequentially.
polyline.new(array.from(firstPoint, secondPoint, thirdPoint), true, line_width = 2)
```

Note that:

- We've used TradingView's "Measure" drawing tool to measure
  the number of bars covered by the script's drawing objects.

### [Future references with `xloc.bar_index`](https://www.tradingview.com#future-references-with-xlocbar_index)

Objects positioned using
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_index)
can contain x-coordinates no further than 500 bars into the future.

### [Other contexts](https://www.tradingview.com#other-contexts)

Scripts cannot use [lines](#lines), [boxes](#boxes), or
[polylines](#polylines)
in `request.*()` functions. Instances of these types can use the values
from `request.*()` calls, but scripts can only create and draw them in
the chart's context.

This limitation is also why drawing objects will not work when using the
`timeframe` parameter in the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
declaration statement.

### [Historical buffer and `max_bars_back`](https://www.tradingview.com#historical-buffer-and-max_bars_back)

Using
[barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isrealtime)
in combination with drawings may sometimes produce unexpected results.
For example, the intention of this script is to ignore all historical
bars and draw horizontal lines spanning 300 bars back on *realtime*
bars:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Historical buffer demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A `chart.point` at the `bar_index` from 300 bars ago and current `close`.
firstPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index[300], close)
//@variable The current bar's `chart.point` containing the current `close`.
secondPoint = chart.point.now(close)

// Draw a new line on realtime bars.
if barstate.isrealtime
    line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint)
```

However, it will fail at runtime and raise an error. The script fails
because it cannot determine the buffer size for historical values of the
underlying
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
series. Although the code doesn't contain the built-in
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
variable, the built-in
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
uses the
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
series in its inner workings. Therefore, accessing the value of the
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
from 300 bars back requires the history buffer of the
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
series to be at least 300 bars.

Pine Script™ includes a mechanism that detects the required historical
buffer size automatically in most cases. It works by letting the script
access historical values any number of bars back for a limited duration.
In this script's case, using
[barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isrealtime)
to control the drawing of lines prevents it from accessing the
historical series, so it cannot infer the required historical buffer
size, and the script fails.

The simple solution to this issue is to use the
[max_bars_back()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back)
function to *explicitly define* the historical buffer of the
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
series before evaluating the
[conditional structure](#conditional-structures):

```
//@version=6
indicator("Historical buffer demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A `chart.point` at the `bar_index` from 300 bars ago and current `close.
firstPoint = chart.point.from_index(bar_index[300], close)
//@variable The current bar's `chart.point` containing the current `close`.
secondPoint = chart.point.now(close)

// Explicitly set the historical buffer of the `time` series to 300 bars.
max_bars_back(time, 300)

// Draw a new line on realtime bars.
if barstate.isrealtime
    line.new(firstPoint, secondPoint)
```

Such issues can be confusing, but they're quite rare. The Pine Script™
team hopes to eliminate them over time.

# [Non-standard charts data](https://www.tradingview.com#non-standard-charts-data)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ features several `ticker.*()` functions that generate *ticker identifiers* for requesting data from *non-standard* chart feeds. The available functions that create these ticker IDs are [ticker.heikinashi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.heikinashi), [ticker.renko()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.renko), [ticker.linebreak()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.linebreak), [ticker.kagi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.kagi), and [ticker.pointfigure()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.pointfigure). Scripts can use these functions' returned values as the `symbol` argument in [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) calls to access non-standard chart data while running on *any* chart type.

## [`ticker.heikinashi()`](https://www.tradingview.com#tickerheikinashi)

*Heikin-Ashi* means *average bar* in Japanese. The open/high/low/close
values of Heikin-Ashi candlesticks are synthetic; they are not actual
market prices. They are calculated by averaging combinations of real
OHLC values from the current and previous bar. The calculations used
make Heikin-Ashi bars less noisy than normal candlesticks. They can be
useful to make visual assessments, but are unsuited to backtesting or
automated trading, as orders execute on market prices — not
Heikin-Ashi prices.

The
[ticker.heikinashi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dheikinashi)
function creates a special ticker identifier for requesting Heikin-Ashi
data with the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
function.

This script requests the close value of Heikin-Ashi bars and plots them
on top of the normal candlesticks:

![image](images/NonStandardCharts-TickerHeikinAshi-01.Cf57zbCt_1Ykjzf.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("HA Close", "", true)
haTicker = ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid)
haClose = request.security(haTicker, timeframe.period, close)
plot(haClose, "HA Close", color.black, 3)
```

Note that:

- The close values for Heikin-Ashi bars plotted as the black line are
  very different from those of real candles using market prices. They
  act more like a moving average.
- The black line appears over the chart bars because we have selected
  "Visual Order/Bring to Front" from the script's "More" menu.

If you wanted to omit values for extended hours in the last example, an
intermediary ticker without extended session information would need to
be created first:

![image](images/NonStandardCharts-TickerHeikinAshi-02.B9TEp43B_ZjVqEN.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("HA Close", "", true)
regularSessionTicker = ticker.new(syminfo.prefix, syminfo.ticker, session.regular)
haTicker = ticker.heikinashi(regularSessionTicker)
haClose = request.security(haTicker, timeframe.period, close, gaps = barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(haClose, "HA Close", color.black, 3, plot.style_linebr)
```

Note that:

- We use the
  [ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  function first, to create a ticker without extended session
  information.
- We use that ticker instead of
  [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dtickerid)
  in our
  [ticker.heikinashi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dheikinashi)
  call.
- In our
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
  call, we set the `gaps` parameter's value to `barmerge.gaps_on`.
  This instructs the function not to use previous values to fill slots
  where data is absent. This makes it possible for it to return
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values outside of regular sessions.
- To be able to see this on the chart, we also need to use a special
  `plot.style_linebr` style, which breaks the plots on
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values.

This script plots Heikin-Ashi candles under the chart:

![image](images/NonStandardCharts-TickerHeikinAshi-03.DDXVmouO_ZyQNBR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Heikin-Ashi candles")
CANDLE_GREEN = #26A69A
CANDLE_RED   = #EF5350

haTicker = ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid)
[haO, haH, haL, haC] = request.security(haTicker, timeframe.period, [open, high, low, close])
candleColor = haC >= haO ? CANDLE_GREEN : CANDLE_RED
plotcandle(haO, haH, haL, haC, color = candleColor)
```

Note that:

- We use a
  [tuple](#tuple-declarations) with
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
  to fetch four values with the same call.
- We use
  [plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
  to plot our candles. See the
  [Bar plotting](#bar-plotting) page
  for more information.

## [`ticker.renko()`](https://www.tradingview.com#tickerrenko)

*Renko* bars only plot price movements, without taking time or volume
into consideration. They look like bricks stacked in adjacent
columns. A new brick is only drawn after the price passes the top or
bottom by a predetermined amount. The
[ticker.renko()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Drenko)
function creates a ticker id which can be used with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
to fetch Renko values, but there is no Pine Script™ function to draw
Renko bars on the chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
renkoTicker = ticker.renko(syminfo.tickerid, "ATR", 10)
renkoLow = request.security(renkoTicker, timeframe.period, low)
plot(renkoLow)
```

## [`ticker.linebreak()`](https://www.tradingview.com#tickerlinebreak)

The *Line Break* chart type displays a series of vertical boxes that are
based on price changes. The
[ticker.linebreak()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dlinebreak)
function creates a ticker id which can be used with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
to fetch "Line Break" values, but there is no Pine Script™ function to
draw such bars on the chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
lineBreakTicker = ticker.linebreak(syminfo.tickerid, 3)
lineBreakClose = request.security(lineBreakTicker, timeframe.period, close)
plot(lineBreakClose)
```

## [`ticker.kagi()`](https://www.tradingview.com#tickerkagi)

*Kagi* charts are made of a continuous line that changes directions. The
direction changes when the price changes beyond a predetermined
amount. The
[ticker.kagi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dkagi)
function creates a ticker id which can be used with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
to fetch "Kagi" values, but there is no Pine Script™ function to draw
such bars on the chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
kagiBreakTicker = ticker.linebreak(syminfo.tickerid, 3)
kagiBreakClose = request.security(kagiBreakTicker, timeframe.period, close)
plot(kagiBreakClose)
```

## [`ticker.pointfigure()`](https://www.tradingview.com#tickerpointfigure)

*Point and Figure* (PnF) charts only plot price movements, without
taking time into consideration. A column of X's is plotted as the price
rises, and O's are plotted when price drops. The
[ticker.pointfigure()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dpointfigure)
function creates a ticker id which can be used with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
to fetch "PnF" values, but there is no Pine Script™ function to draw
such bars on the chart. Every column of X's or O's is represented with
four numbers. You may think of them as synthetic OHLC PnF values:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
pnfTicker = ticker.pointfigure(syminfo.tickerid, "hl", "ATR", 14, 3)
[pnfO, pnfC] = request.security(pnfTicker, timeframe.period, [open, close], barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(pnfO, "PnF Open", color.green, 4, plot.style_linebr)
plot(pnfC, "PnF Close", color.red, 4, plot.style_linebr)
```

# [Other timeframes and data](https://www.tradingview.com#other-timeframes-and-data)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ allows users to request data from sources and contexts
other than those their charts use. The functions we present on this page
can fetch data from a variety of alternative sources:

- [request.security()](#requestsecurity) retrieves data from another symbol, timeframe, or other
  context.
- [request.security_lower_tf()](#requestsecurity_lower_tf) retrieves *intrabar* data, i.e., data from a timeframe
  lower than the chart timeframe.
- [request.currency_rate()](#requestcurrency_rate) requests a *daily rate* to convert a value expressed in
  one currency to another.
- [request.dividends(), request.splits(), and request.earnings()](#requestdividends-requestsplits-and-requestearnings) respectively retrieve information about an issuing
  company's dividends, splits, and earnings.
- [request.financial()](#requestfinancial) retrieves financial data from
  [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/).
- [request.economic()](#requesteconomic) retrieves economic and industry data.
- [request.seed()](#requestseed) retrieves data from a *user-maintained* GitHub
  repository.

These are the signatures of the functions in the `request.*` namespace:

```
request.security(symbol, timeframe, expression, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, calc_bars_count) → series <type>
request.security_lower_tf(symbol, timeframe, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, ignore_invalid_timeframe, calc_bars_count) → array<type>
request.currency_rate(from, to, ignore_invalid_currency) → series float
request.dividends(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float
request.splits(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float
request.earnings(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float
request.financial(symbol, financial_id, period, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float
request.economic(country_code, field, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float
request.seed(source, symbol, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, calc_bars_count) → series <type>
```

The `request.*()` family of functions has numerous potential applications. Throughout this page, we discuss in detail these functions and some of their typical use cases.

## [Common characteristics](https://www.tradingview.com#common-characteristics)

Many functions in the `request.*()` namespace share some common properties and parameters. Before we explore each function in depth, let's familiarize ourselves with these characteristics.

### [Behavior](https://www.tradingview.com#behavior)

All `request.*()` functions have similar internal behavior, even though they do not all share the same required parameters. Every unique `request.*()` call in a script requests a dataset from a defined *context* (i.e., ticker ID and timeframe) and evaluates an *expression* across the retrieved data.

The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) and [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) functions allow programmers to specify the context of a request and the expression directly via the `symbol`, `timeframe`, and `expression` parameters, making them suitable for a wide range of data requests.

For example, the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call in this simple script requests daily "AMEX:SPY" data, and it calculates the slope of a 20-bar linear regression line using the retrieved [hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2) prices. The first two arguments specify the context of the request, and the third specifies the expression to evaluate across the requested data:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Behavior-1.B41_C2G4_Z2uWgbr.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Behavior of `request.security()` demo")

//@variable The 20-bar linear regression slope of `hl2` prices from the "AMEX:SPY" symbol on the "1D" timeframe.
float requestedSlope = request.security("AMEX:SPY", "1D", ta.linreg(hl2, 20, 0) - ta.linreg(hl2, 20, 1))

//@variable Is `color.teal` when the `requestedSlope` is positive, and `color.maroon` otherwise.
color plotColor = requestedSlope > 0 ? color.teal : color.maroon

// Plot the `requestedSlope` with the `plotColor`.
plot(requestedSlope, "Requested slope", plotColor, 1, plot.style_area)
```

Other functions within the `request.*()` namespace *do not* allow programmers to directly define the full context of a request or the evaluated expression. Instead, these functions determine some of the necessary information *internally* because they perform only specific types of requests.

For instance, [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial) exclusively retrieves periodic financial data. Its required parameters (`symbol`, `financial_id`, and `period`) all define parts of a specific financial *ticker ID*. The function does not allow specification of the timeframe or expression, as it determines these details internally. The script below demonstrates a simple call to this function that retrieves the annual cost of goods data for the chart symbol's issuing company:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Behavior-2.E8W5-ysC_Z12hBhd.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Behavior of `request.financial()` demo", format = format.volume)

//@variable The annual cost of goods sold by the chart symbol's issuing company.
float costOfGoods = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "COST_OF_GOODS", "FY")

// Plot the `costOfGoods`.
plot(costOfGoods, "Cost of goods", color.purple, 3, plot.style_stepline_diamond)
```

Scripts can perform up to 40 unique requests using any combination of `request.*()` function calls. Only unique `request.*()` calls count toward this limit because they are the only calls that fetch *new data*. Redundant calls to the same `request.*()` function with identical arguments *do not* retrieve new data. Instead, they *reuse* the data from the first executed call. See [this section](#number-of-calls) of the [Limitations](#limitations) page for more information.

### [`gaps`](https://www.tradingview.com#gaps)

When using a `request.*()` function to retrieve data from another context, the data may not come in on each new bar as it would with the current chart. The `gaps` parameter of a `request.*()` function controls how the function responds to nonexistent values in the requested series.

Suppose we have a script executing on an 1-minute chart that requests hourly data for the chart's symbol using [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security). The function call returns new values only on the 1-minute bars that cover the opening and closing times of the symbol's hourly bars. On other chart bars, we can decide whether the function returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values or the last available values via the `gaps` parameter.

When the `gaps` parameter uses [barmerge.gaps_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.gaps_on), the function returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) results on all chart bars where new data is not yet confirmed from the requested context. Otherwise, when the parameter uses [barmerge.gaps_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.gaps_off), the function fills the gaps in the requested data with the last confirmed values on historical bars and the most recent developing values on realtime bars.

The script below demonstrates the difference in behavior by [plotting](#plots) the results from two [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) calls that fetch the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) price of the current symbol from the hourly timeframe on a 1-minute chart. The first call uses `gaps = barmerge.gaps_off` and the second uses `gaps = barmerge.gaps_on`:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Gaps-1.DX6PixJ0_ZcmWMl.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`gaps` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The `close` requested from the hourly timeframe without gaps.
float dataWithoutGaps = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "60", close, gaps = barmerge.gaps_off)
//@variable The `close` requested from the hourly timeframe with gaps.
float dataWithGaps = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "60", close, gaps = barmerge.gaps_on)

// Plot the requested data.
plot(dataWithoutGaps, "Data without gaps", color.blue, 3, plot.style_linebr)
plot(dataWithGaps, "Data with gaps", color.purple, 15, plot.style_linebr)

// Highlight the background for realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.aqua, 70) : na, title = "Realtime bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- [barmerge.gaps_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.gaps_off) is the default value for the `gaps` parameter in all applicable `request.*()` functions.
- The script plots the requested series as lines with breaks ([plot.style_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_plot.style_linebr)), which do not bridge over [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values as the default style ([plot.style_line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_plot.style_line)) does.
- When using [barmerge.gaps_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.gaps_off), the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function returns the last confirmed [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) from the hourly timeframe on all historical bars. When running on *realtime bars* (the bars with the [color.aqua](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.aqua) background in this example), it returns the symbol's current [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) value, regardless of confirmation. For more information, see the [Historical and realtime behavior](#historical-and-realtime-behavior) section of this page.

### [`ignore_invalid_symbol`](https://www.tradingview.com#ignore_invalid_symbol)

The `ignore_invalid_symbol` parameter of `request.*()` functions determines how a function handles invalid data requests, e.g.:

- Using a `request.*()` function with a nonexistent ticker ID as the `symbol/ticker` parameter.
- Using [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial) to retrieve information that does not exist for the specified `symbol` or `period`.
- Using [request.economic()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.economic) to request a `field` that does not exist for a `country_code`.

A `request.*()` function call produces a *runtime error* and halts the execution of the script when making an erroneous request if its `ignore_invalid_symbol` parameter is `false`. When this parameter's value is `true`, the function returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values in such a case instead of raising an error.

This example uses `request.*()` calls within a [user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) to retrieve data for estimating an instrument's market capitalization (market cap). The user-defined `calcMarketCap()` function calls [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial) to retrieve the total shares outstanding for a symbol and [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to retrieve a tuple containing the symbol's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) price and [currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.currency). We've included `ignore_invalid_symbol = true` in both of these `request.*()` calls to prevent runtime errors for invalid requests.

The script displays a [formatted string](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format) representing the symbol's estimated market cap value and currency in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the chart and uses a [plot](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) to visualize the `marketCap` history:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Ignore-invalid-symbol-1.DPSV2CB9_2wVvY7.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`ignore_invalid_symbol` demo", "Market cap estimate", format = format.volume)

//@variable The symbol to request data from.
string symbol = input.symbol("TSX:SHOP", "Symbol")

//@function Estimates the market capitalization of the specified `tickerID` if the data exists.
calcMarketCap(simple string tickerID) =>
    //@variable The quarterly total shares outstanding for the `tickerID`. Returns `na` when the data isn't available.
    float tso = request.financial(tickerID, "TOTAL_SHARES_OUTSTANDING", "FQ", ignore_invalid_symbol = true)
    //@variable The `close` price and currency for the `tickerID`. Returns `[na, na]` when the `tickerID` is invalid.
    [price, currency] = request.security(
         tickerID, timeframe.period, [close, syminfo.currency], ignore_invalid_symbol = true
     )
    // Return a tuple containing the market cap estimate and the quote currency.
    [tso * price, currency]

//@variable A `table` object with a single cell that displays the `marketCap` and `quoteCurrency`.
var table infoTable = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
// Initialize the table's cell on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    table.cell(infoTable, 0, 0, "", text_color = color.white, text_size = size.huge, bgcolor = color.teal)

// Get the market cap estimate and quote currency for the `symbol`.
[marketCap, quoteCurrency] = calcMarketCap(symbol)

if barstate.islast
    //@variable The formatted text displayed inside the `infoTable`.
    string tableText = str.format("Market cap:\n{0} {1}", str.tostring(marketCap, format.volume), quoteCurrency)
    // Update the `infoTable`.
    table.cell_set_text(infoTable, 0, 0, tableText)

// Plot the `marketCap` value.
plot(marketCap, "Market cap", color.new(color.purple, 60), style = plot.style_area)
```

Note that:

- The `calcMarketCap()` function only returns non-na values on valid instruments with total shares outstanding data, such as the one we selected for this example. It returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on others that do not have financial data, including forex, crypto, and derivatives.
- Not all issuing companies publish quarterly financial reports. If the issuing company of the `symbol` does not report on a quarterly basis, change the "FQ" value in this script to the company's minimum reporting period. See the [request.financial()](#requestfinancial) section for more information.
- We included [format.volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_format.volume) in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) and [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring) calls to specify that the y-axis of the chart pane represents volume-formatted values and the "string" representation of the `marketCap` value shows as volume-formatted text.
- This script creates a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) and initializes its cell on the [first chart bar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isfirst), then [updates the cell's text](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell_set_text) on the last chart bar. To learn more about working with tables, see the [Tables](#tables) page.

### [`currency`](https://www.tradingview.com#currency)

The `currency` parameter of a `request.*()` function allows users to specify the currency of the requested data. When this parameter's value differs from the [syminfo.currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.currency) of the symbol, the function converts the requested values to express them in the specified `currency`. This parameter accepts a built-in variable from the `currency.*` namespace, such as [currency.JPY](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_currency.JPY), or a "string" representing a valid currency code (e.g., "JPY"). By default, this parameter accepts a "series" argument that can change across executions. If [dynamic requests](#dynamic-requests) are disabled, it accepts a value with only a "simple" or weaker [qualifier](#qualifiers).

The conversion rate between the [syminfo.currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.currency) of the requested data and the specified `currency` depends on the *previous daily value* of the corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange. If no exchange provides the rate directly, the function derives the rate using a [spread symbol](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502298/).

### [`lookahead`](https://www.tradingview.com#lookahead)

The `lookahead` parameter in [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security), [request.dividends()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.dividends), [request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits), and [request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings) specifies the lookahead behavior of the function call. Its default value is [barmerge.lookahead_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_off).

When requesting data from a higher-timeframe (HTF) context, the `lookahead` value determines whether the `request.*()` function can return values from times *beyond* those of the historical bars it executes on. In other words, the `lookahead` paremeter determines whether the requested data may contain *lookahead bias* on historical bars.

When requesting data from a lower-timeframe (LTF) context, the `lookahead` parameter determines whether the function requests values from the first or last *intrabar* (LTF bar) of each chart-timeframe bar.

**Programmers should exercise extreme caution when using lookahead in their requests, namely when requesting data from higher timeframes.**
When using [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on) as the `lookahead` value, ensure that it does not compromise the integrity of the script's logic by leaking *future data* into historical chart bars.

The following scenarios are cases where enabling lookahead is acceptable in a `request.*()` call:

- The `expression` in [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) references a series with a *historical offset* (e.g., `close[1]`), which prevents the function from requesting future values that it would **not** have access to on a realtime basis.
- The specified `timeframe` in the call is the same as the chart the script executes on, i.e., [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period).
- The function call requests data from an intrabar timeframe, i.e., a timeframe smaller than the [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period). See [this section](#lower-timeframes) for more information.

This example demonstrates how the `lookahead` parameter affects the behavior of higher-timeframe data requests and why enabling lookahead in [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) without offsetting the `expression` is misleading. The script calls [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) to get the HTF [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) price for the current chart's symbol in three different ways and [plots](#plots) the resulting series on the chart for comparison.

The first call uses [barmerge.lookahead_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_off) (default), and the others use [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on). However, the third [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call also *offsets* its `expression` using the history-referencing operator [[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D) to avoid leaking future data into the past.

As we see on the chart, the [plot](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) of the series requested using [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on) without an offset ([fuchsia](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.fuchsia) line) shows final HTF [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) prices *before* they are actually available on historical bars, whereas the other two calls do not:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Lookahead-1.DhbZxNLg_239Pup.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`lookahead` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The timeframe to request the data from.
string timeframe = input.timeframe("30", "Timeframe")

//@variable The requested `high` price from the current symbol on the `timeframe` without lookahead bias.
//          On realtime bars, it returns the current `high` of the `timeframe`.
float lookaheadOff = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, high, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_off)

//@variable The requested `high` price from the current symbol on the `timeframe` with lookahead bias.
//          Returns values that should NOT be accessible yet on historical bars.
float lookaheadOn = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, high, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

//@variable The requested `high` price from the current symbol on the `timeframe` without lookahead bias or repainting.
//          Behaves the same on historical and realtime bars.
float lookaheadOnOffset = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, high[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

// Plot the values.
plot(lookaheadOff, "High, no lookahead bias", color.new(color.blue, 40), 5)
plot(lookaheadOn, "High with lookahead bias", color.fuchsia, 3)
plot(lookaheadOnOffset, "High, no lookahead bias or repaint", color.aqua, 3)
// Highlight the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 60) : na, title = "Realtime bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- The series requested using [barmerge.lookahead_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_off) has a new historical value at the *end* of each HTF period, and both series requested using [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on) have new historical data at the *start* of each period.
- On realtime bars, the plot of the series without lookahead ([blue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.blue)) and the series with lookahead and no historical offset ([fuchsia](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.fuchsia)) show the *same value* (i.e., the HTF period's unconfirmed [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) price), as no data exists beyond those points to leak into the past. Both of these plots *repaint* their results after restarting the script's executions, as [realtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isrealtime) bars become [historical](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.ishistory) bars.
- The series that uses lookahead and a historical offset ([aqua](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.aqua)) *does not* repaint its values, as it always references the last *confirmed* value from the higher timeframe. See the [Avoiding repainting](#avoiding-repainting) section of this page for more information.

### [Dynamic requests](https://www.tradingview.com#dynamic-requests)

By default, unlike all previous Pine Script™ versions, all v6 script's `request.*()` functions are *dynamic*.

In contrast to non-dynamic requests, dynamic requests can:

- Access data from different data feeds using a single `request.*()` instance with ["series" arguments](#series-arguments).
- Execute within the [local scopes](#in-local-scopes) of [conditional structures](#conditional-structures), [loops](#loops), and [exported functions](#library-functions).
- Execute [nested requests](#nested-requests).

Aside from the features listed above, there are insignificant differences in the behavior of dynamic and non-dynamic requests. However, for backward compatibility, programmers can deactivate dynamic requests by specifying `dynamic_requests = false` in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), or [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library) declaration statement.

#### ["series" arguments](https://www.tradingview.com#series-arguments)

Scripts without dynamic requests enabled cannot use "series" arguments for most `request.*()` function parameters, which means the argument values *cannot change*. The only exception is the `expression` parameter in [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security), [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf), and [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.seed), which *always* allows "series" values.

In contrast, when a script allows dynamic requests, all `request.*()` function parameters that define parts of the ticker ID or timeframe of a request accept "series" arguments that *can change* with each script execution. In other words, with dynamic requests, it's possible for a single `request.*()` instance to fetch data from *different contexts* in different executions. Some other optional parameters, such as `ignore_invalid_symbol`, can also accept "series" arguments, allowing additional flexibility in `request.*()` call behaviors.

The following script declares a `symbolSeries` variable that is assigned four different symbol strings in 20-bar cycles, with its value changing after every five bars. The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call uses this variable as the `symbol` argument. The script plots the `requestedClose` values, which therefore represent a different symbol's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices for each five-bar period.

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Dynamic-requests-Series-arguments-1.B-eSJN4x_2cWo6g.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("'series' arguments demo")

//@variable A "series" that cycles through four different symbol strings. Its value changes every five bars.  
string symbolSeries = switch int(bar_index / 5) % 4
    1 => "NASDAQ:MSFT"
    2 => "NASDAQ:AMD"
    3 => "NASDAQ:INTC"
    =>   "AMEX:SPY"

//@variable The requested `close` value from one of the four `symbolSeries` values on the chart's timeframe.
float requestedClose = request.security(symbolSeries, timeframe.period, close)

// Plot the `requestedClose`.
plot(requestedClose, "Requested close", color.purple, 3)

// Draw a label displaying the requested symbol each time the `symbolSeries` changes.
if symbolSeries != symbolSeries[1]
    label.new(bar_index, requestedClose, symbolSeries, textcolor = color.white)
```

Note that:

- The script draws a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) every time the `symbolSeries` changes, to signify which symbol's data the `requestedClose` currently represents.
- Pine v6 scripts enable dynamic requests by default, allowing this script to use a "series string" `symbol` argument in its [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call without error. If the dynamic behavior is disabled by including `dynamic_requests = false` in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration, then the "series" argument causes a compilation error.

An important limitation is that when using dynamic `request.*()` calls with "series" arguments or within [local scopes](#in-local-scopes), scripts must request all required datasets while executing on **historical bars**. All `request.*()` calls on *realtime* bars can retrieve data from the datasets that the script previously accessed on historical bars, but they **cannot** request a new context or evaluate a new expression.

To illustrate this limitation, let's revisit the above script. Notice that it requests [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) data for all four symbols on the chart's timeframe during its historical executions. The external datasets for those four contexts are the **only** ones that any `request.*()` call on realtime bars can access.

Below, we changed the `timeframe` argument in the script's [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call to specify that it requests `symbolSeries` data from the chart's timeframe on historical bars and the "240" (240 minutes = 4H) timeframe on realtime bars. This version raises a runtime error on the first realtime tick, if it is run on any timeframe other than the 4H timeframe, because it **cannot** access the 4H data feeds without requesting them on historical bars first:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Invalid realtime request demo")

//@variable A "series" that cycles through four different symbol strings. Its value changes every five bars.  
string symbolSeries = switch int(bar_index / 5) % 4
    1 => "NASDAQ:MSFT"
    2 => "NASDAQ:AMD"
    3 => "NASDAQ:INTC"
    =>   "AMEX:SPY"

// Request the `close` of the `symbolSeries` from the chart's timeframe on historical bars and the "240" (4H) timeframe 
// on realtime bars. Causes a runtime error on the first realtime tick because the script did not previously access 
// data from the "240" timeframe on any historical bars. 
float requestedClose = request.security(symbolSeries, barstate.isrealtime ? "240" : timeframe.period, close)

// Plot the `requestedClose`.
plot(requestedClose, "Requested close", color.purple, 3)

// Draw a label displaying the requested symbol each time the `symbolSeries` changes.
if symbolSeries != symbolSeries[1]
    label.new(bar_index, requestedClose, symbolSeries, textcolor = color.white)
```

#### [In local scopes](https://www.tradingview.com#in-local-scopes)

When scripts do not allow dynamic requests, all `request.*()` calls execute once on *every* bar or realtime tick, which prevents their use within most local scopes. The only exception is for `request.*()` calls in the scopes of *non-exported*[functions](#user-defined-functions) and [methods](#user-defined-methods), because the Pine Script™ compiler extracts such calls into the *global scope* during translation.

Scripts that allow dynamic requests *do not* restrict the execution of `request.*()` calls to the global scope. They can call `request.*()` functions directly within the scopes of [conditional structures](#conditional-structures) and [loops](#loops), meaning that each `request.*()` instance in the code can activate zero, one, or several times on each script execution.

The following example uses a single [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) instance within a loop to request data from multiple forex data feeds. The script declares an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of `symbols` on the first chart bar, which it iterates through on all bars using a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop. Each loop iteration calls [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) to retrieve the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) value for one of the symbols and [pushes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push) the result into the `requestedData` array. After the loop terminates, the script calculates the [average](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg), [maximum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.max), and [minimum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min) values from the `requestedData` array and plots those values on the chart:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Dynamic-requests-In-local-scopes-1.Bgx3zpOB_Z21iFsc.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("In local scopes demo", format = format.volume)

//@variable An array of "string" values representing different symbols to request. 
var array<string> symbols = array.from(
     "EURUSD", "USDJPY", "GBPUSD", "AUDUSD", "USDCAD", "USDCHF", "NZDUSD", "EURJPY", "GBPJPY", "EURGBP"
 )

//@variable An array containing the data retrieved for each requested symbol.  
array<float> requestedData = array.new<float>()

// Retrieve `volume` data for each symbol in the `symbols` array and push the results into the `requestedData` array. 
for symbol in symbols
    float data = request.security("OANDA:" + symbol, timeframe.period, volume)
    requestedData.push(data)

// Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum tick volume in the `requestedData`.
float avgVolume = requestedData.avg()
float maxVolume = requestedData.max()
float minVolume = requestedData.min()

// Plot the `avgVolume`, `maxVolume`, and `minVolume`. 
plot(avgVolume, "Average volume", color.gray,   3)
plot(maxVolume, "Highest volume", color.teal,   3)
plot(minVolume, "Lowest volume",  color.maroon, 3)
```

Notice that the `expression` argument in the above example ([volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)) is *loop-invariant*, i.e., it does not change on any loop iteration. When using `request.*()` calls within a loop, all parameters defining parts of the requested *context* can accept arguments that depend on variables from the loop's header or mutable variables that change within the loop's local scope. However, a `request.*()` call's evaluated expression **cannot** depend on the values of those variables.

Here, we modified the above script to use the *second form* of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop statement, which creates a [tuple](#tuples) containing the index and value of each element in the `symbols` array. The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) instance in this version uses the index (`i`) in its `expression` argument, resulting in a *compilation error*:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Loop-dependent expression demo", format = format.volume)

//@variable An array of "string" values representing different symbols to request. 
var array<string> symbols = array.from(
     "EURUSD", "USDJPY", "GBPUSD", "AUDUSD", "USDCAD", "USDCHF", "NZDUSD", "EURJPY", "GBPJPY", "EURGBP"
 )

//@variable An array containing the data retrieved for each requested symbol.  
array<float> requestedData = array.new<float>()

// Retrieve `volume` data for each symbol in the `symbols` array, weighted using the element index.
// Causes a compilation error because the `expression` in `request.security()` cannot depend on loop variables 
// or mutable variables that change within the loop's scope. 
for [i, symbol] in symbols
    float data = request.security("OANDA:" + symbol, timeframe.period, volume * (10 - i))
    requestedData.push(data)

// Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum tick volume in the `requestedData`.
float avgVolume = requestedData.avg()
float maxVolume = requestedData.max()
float minVolume = requestedData.min()

// Plot the `avgVolume`, `maxVolume`, and `minVolume`. 
plot(avgVolume, "Average volume", color.gray,   3)
plot(maxVolume, "Highest volume", color.teal,   3)
plot(minVolume, "Lowest volume",  color.maroon, 3)
```

#### [In libraries](https://www.tradingview.com#in-libraries)

[Libraries](#libraries) with dynamic requests enabled can *export*[functions](#user-defined-functions) and [methods](#user-defined-methods) that utilize `request.*()` calls within their local scopes, provided that the evaluated expressions **do not** depend on any exported function parameters.

For example, this simple library exports an `htfPrices()` function that requests a [tuple](#tuples) of confirmed [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low), and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices using a specified `tickerID` and `timeframe`. If we publish this library, another script can *import* the function to request higher-timeframe prices without explicitly calling [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security).

```
//@version=6
library("DynamicRequests")

//@function        Requests a tuple containing confirmed HTF OHLC data for a specified `tickerID` and `timeframe`.
//@param tickerID  The ticker identifier to request data for. 
//@param timeframe The timeframe of the requested data.
//@returns         A tuple containing the last confirmed `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` from the requested context.
export htfPrices(string tickerID, string timeframe) =>
    if timeframe.in_seconds() >= timeframe.in_seconds(timeframe)
        runtime.error("The `timeframe` argument of `getHTFPrices()` must be higher than the chart's timeframe.")
    request.security(tickerID, timeframe, [open[1], high[1], low[1], close[1]], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
```

Note that:

- The tuple that the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call includes as the `expression` argument *does not* depend on the `htfPrices()` parameters.
- The `htfPrices()` function raises a custom [runtime error](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_runtime.error) when the `timeframe` argument is not higher than the chart's timeframe. See the [higher timeframes](#higher-timeframes) section for more information.
- The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call uses [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_on) and offsets each item in the tuple by one bar. This is the only recommended method to [avoid repainting](#avoiding-repainting).

#### [Nested requests](https://www.tradingview.com#nested-requests)

Scripts can use dynamic requests to execute *nested requests*, i.e., `request.*()` calls that dynamically evaluate other `request.*()` calls that their `expression` arguments depend on.

When a [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) or [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) call uses an empty string or [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid) for its `symbol` argument, or if it uses an empty string or [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) for the `timeframe` argument, the requested ticker ID or timeframe *depends* on the context where the call executes. This context is normally the ticker ID or timeframe of the chart that the script is running on. However, if such a [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) or [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) function call is evaluated by another `request.*()` call, the nested request *inherits* that `request.*()` call's ticker ID or timeframe information.

For example, the script below contains two [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) calls and uses [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) to display their results. The first call uses empty strings as its `symbol` and `timeframe` arguments, meaning that the requested context depends on where the call executes. It evaluates a concatenated string containing the call's requested ticker ID and timeframe, and the script assigns its result to the `info1` variable.

The second call requests data for a specific `symbol` and `timeframe` using the `info1` variable as its `expression` argument. Since the `info1` variable depends on the first [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call, the second call evaluates the first call *within* its own context. Therefore, the first call adopts the second call's ticker ID and timeframe while executing within that context, resulting in a different returned value:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Dynamic-requests-Nested-requests-1.cfjIWGiA_Z1Jgykj.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Nested requests demo")

//@variable A concatenated string containing the current `syminfo.tickerid` and `timeframe.period`.
string info1 = request.security("", "", syminfo.tickerid + "_" + timeframe.period)
//@variable A concatenated string representing the `info1` value calculated within the "NASDAQ:AAPL, 240" context.
//          This call evaluates the call on line 5 within its context to determine its result because the script 
//          allows dynamic requests.
string info2 = request.security("NASDAQ:AAPL", "240", info1)

// Log the results from both calls in the Pine Logs pane on the last historical bar. 
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    log.info("First request: {0}", info1)
    log.info("Second request: {0}", info2)
```

This script allows the execution of the first [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call within the context of the second call because Pine v6 scripts enable dynamic `request.*()` calls by default. We can disable this behavior by including `dynamic_requests = false` in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration statement. Without dynamic requests enabled, the script evaluates each call *independently*, passing the first call's calculated value directly into the second call rather than executing the first call within the second context. Consequently, the second call's returned value is the *same* as the first call's value, as we see below:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Common-characteristics-Dynamic-requests-Nested-requests-2.D2duF-iw_1E8FIY.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Nested requests demo", dynamic_requests = false)

//@variable A concatenated string containing the current `syminfo.tickerid` and `timeframe.period`.
string info1 = request.security("", "", syminfo.tickerid + "_" + timeframe.period)
//@variable The same value as `info1`. This call does not evalutate the call on line 5 because dynamic requests aren't 
//          allowed. Instead, it only uses the value of `info1`, meaning its result does not change. 
string info2 = request.security("NASDAQ:AAPL", "240", info1)

// Log the results from both calls in the Pine Logs pane on the last historical bar. 
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    log.info("First request: {0}", info1)
    log.info("Second request: {0}", info2)
```

## [Data feeds](https://www.tradingview.com#data-feeds)

TradingView's data providers supply different data feeds that scripts
can access to retrieve information about an instrument, including:

- Intraday historical data (for timeframes < 1D)
- End-of-day (EOD) historical data (for timeframes >= 1D)
- Realtime data (which may be delayed, depending on your account type
  and extra data services)
- Extended hours data

Not all of these data feed types exist for every instrument. For
example, the symbol "BNC:BLX" only has EOD data available.

For some instruments with intraday and EOD historical feeds, volume data
may not be the same since some trades (block trades, OTC trades, etc.)
may only be available at the *end* of the trading day. Consequently, the
EOD feed will include this volume data, but the intraday feed will not.
Differences between EOD and intraday volume feeds are almost nonexistent
for instruments such as cryptocurrencies, but they are commonplace in
stocks.

Slight price discrepancies may also occur between EOD and intraday
feeds. For example, the high value on one EOD bar may not match any
intraday high values supplied by the data provider for that day.

Another distinction between EOD and intraday data feeds is that EOD
feeds do not contain information from *extended hours*.

When retrieving information on realtime bars with `request.*()`
functions, it's important to note that historical and realtime data
reported for an instrument often rely on *different* data feeds. A
broker/exchange may retroactively modify values reported on realtime
bars, which the data will only reflect after refreshing the chart or
restarting the script.

Another important consideration is that the chart's data feeds and
feeds requested from providers by the script are managed by
*independent*, concurrent processes. Consequently, in some *rare* cases,
it's possible for races to occur where requested results temporarily
fall out of synch with the chart on a realtime bar, which a script
retroactively adjusts after restarting its executions.

These points may account for variations in the values retrieved by
`request.*()` functions when requesting data from other contexts. They
may also result in discrepancies between data received on realtime bars
and historical bars. There are no steadfast rules about the variations
one may encounter in their requested data feeds.

When using data feeds requested from other contexts, it's also crucial
to consider the *time axis* differences between the chart the script
executes on and the requested feeds since `request.*()` functions adapt
the returned series to the chart's time axis. For example, requesting
"BTCUSD" data on the "SPY" chart with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
will only show new values when the "SPY" chart has new data as well.
Since "SPY" is not a 24-hour symbol, the "BTCUSD" data returned will
contain gaps that are otherwise not present when viewing its chart
directly.

## [`request.security()`](https://www.tradingview.com#requestsecurity)

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function allows scripts to request data from other contexts than the
chart the script executes on, such as:

- Other symbols, including [spread
  symbols](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502298/)
- Other timeframes (see our User Manual's page on
  [Timeframes](#timeframes) to learn
  about timeframe specifications in Pine Script™)
- [Custom contexts](#custom-contexts), including alternative sessions, price adjustments,
  chart types, etc. using `ticker.*()` functions

This is the function's signature:

```
request.security(symbol, timeframe, expression, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, calc_bars_count) → series <type>
```

The `symbol` value is the ticker identifier representing the symbol to
fetch data from. This parameter accepts values in any of the following
formats:

- A "string" representing a symbol (e.g., "IBM" or "EURUSD") or
  an *"Exchange:Symbol" pair* (e.g., "NYSE:IBM" or
  "OANDA:EURUSD"). When the value does not contain an exchange
  prefix, the function selects the exchange automatically. We
  recommend specifying the exchange prefix when possible for
  consistent results. Users can also pass an empty string to this
  parameter, which prompts the function to use the current chart's
  symbol.
- A "string" representing a [spread
  symbol](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502298/)
  (e.g., "AMD/INTC"). Note that "Bar Replay" mode does not work
  with these symbols.
- The
  [syminfo.ticker](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.ticker)
  or
  [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid)
  built-in variables, which return the symbol or the
  "Exchange:Symbol" pair that the current chart references. We
  recommend using
  [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid)
  to avoid ambiguity unless the exchange information does not matter
  in the data request. For more information on `syminfo.*` variables,
  see
  [this](#symbol-information) section of our
  [Chart information](#chart-information) page.
- A custom ticker identifier created using `ticker.*()` functions.
  Ticker IDs constructed from these functions may contain additional
  settings for requesting data using
  [non-standard chart](#non-standard-charts-data) calculations, alternative sessions, and other contexts.
  See the
  [Custom contexts](#custom-contexts) section for more information.

The `timeframe` value specifies the timeframe of the requested data.
This parameter accepts "string" values in our
[timeframe specification](#timeframe-string-specifications) format (e.g., a value of "1D" represents the daily
timeframe). To request data from the same timeframe as the chart the
script executes on, use the
[timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period)
variable or an empty string.

The `expression` parameter of the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function determines the data it retrieves from the specified context.
This versatile parameter accepts "series" values of
[int](#int),
[float](#float),
[bool](#bool),
[color](#color),
[string](#string),
and [chart.point](#chart-points) types. It can also accept
[tuples](#tuples),
[collections](#collections),
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types), and the outputs of function and
[method](#methods) calls. For more
details on the data one can retrieve, see the
[Requestable data](#requestable-data) section below.

### [Timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#timeframes)

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function can request data from any available timeframe, regardless of
the chart the script executes on. The timeframe of the data retrieved
depends on the `timeframe` argument in the function call, which may
represent a higher timeframe (e.g., using "1D" as the `timeframe`
value while running the script on an intraday chart) or the chart's
timeframe (i.e., using
[timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period)
or an empty string as the `timeframe` argument).

Scripts can also request *limited* data from lower timeframes with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
(e.g., using "1" as the `timeframe` argument while running the script
on a 60-minute chart). However, we don't typically recommend using this
function for LTF data requests. The
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
function is more optimal for such cases.

#### [Higher timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#higher-timeframes)

Most use cases of
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
involve requesting data from a timeframe higher than or the same as the
chart timeframe. For example, this script retrieves the
[hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2)
price from a requested `higherTimeframe`. It
[plots](#plots) the resulting series
on the chart alongside the current chart's
[hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2) for
comparison:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Timeframes-Higher-timeframes-1.Cfl6KncV_1tTnEJ.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Higher timeframe security demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The higher timeframe to request data from.
string higherTimeframe = input.timeframe("240", "Higher timeframe")

//@variable The `hl2` value from the `higherTimeframe`. Combines lookahead with an offset to avoid repainting.
float htfPrice = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, higherTimeframe, hl2[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

// Plot the `hl2` from the chart timeframe and the `higherTimeframe`.
plot(hl2, "Current timeframe HL2", color.teal, 2)
plot(htfPrice, "Higher timeframe HL2", color.purple, 3)
```

Note that:

- We've included an offset to the `expression` argument and used
  [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
  in
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  to ensure the series returned behaves the same on historical and
  realtime bars. See the
  [Avoiding repainting](#avoiding-repainting) section for more information.

Notice that in the above example, it is possible to select a
`higherTimeframe` value that actually represents a *lower timeframe*
than the one the chart uses, as the code does not prevent it. When
designing a script to work specifically with higher timeframes, we
recommend including conditions to prevent it from accessing lower
timeframes, especially if you intend to
[publish](#publishing) it.

Below, we've added an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure to our previous example that raises a [runtime
error](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_runtime.error)
when the `higherTimeframe` input represents a timeframe smaller than the
chart timeframe, effectively preventing the script from requesting LTF
data:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Timeframes-Higher-timeframes-2.DLmdElJ0_Z1Wqvh6.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Higher timeframe security demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The higher timeframe to request data from.
string higherTimeframe = input.timeframe("240", "Higher timeframe")

// Raise a runtime error when the `higherTimeframe` is smaller than the chart's timeframe.
if timeframe.in_seconds() > timeframe.in_seconds(higherTimeframe)
    runtime.error("The requested timeframe is smaller than the chart's timeframe. Select a higher timeframe.")

//@variable The `hl2` value from the `higherTimeframe`. Combines lookahead with an offset to avoid repainting.
float htfPrice = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, higherTimeframe, hl2[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

// Plot the `hl2` from the chart timeframe and the `higherTimeframe`.
plot(hl2, "Current timeframe HL2", color.teal, 2)
plot(htfPrice, "Higher timeframe HL2", color.purple, 3)
```

#### [Lower timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#lower-timeframes)

Although the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function is intended to operate on timeframes greater than or equal to
the chart timeframe, it *can* request data from lower timeframes as
well, with limitations. When calling this function to access a lower
timeframe, it will evaluate the `expression` from the LTF context.
However, it can only return the results from a *single* intrabar (LTF
bar) on each chart bar.

The intrabar that the function returns data from on each historical
chart bar depends on the `lookahead` value in the function call. When
using
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on),
it will return the *first* available intrabar from the chart period.
When using
[barmerge.lookahead_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_off),
it will return the *last* intrabar from the chart period. On realtime
bars, it returns the last available value of the `expression` from the
timeframe, regardless of the `lookahead` value, as the realtime intrabar
information retrieved by the function is not yet sorted.

This script retrieves
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
data from the valid timeframe closest to a fourth of the size of the
chart timeframe. It makes two calls to
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
with different `lookahead` values. The first call uses
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
to access the first intrabar value in each chart bar. The second uses
the default `lookahead` value
([barmerge.lookahead_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_off)),
which requests the last intrabar value assigned to each chart bar. The
script [plots](#plots) the outputs of
both calls on the chart to compare the difference:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Timeframes-Lower-timeframes-1.CzbZyyC2_Z2o4fpJ.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Lower timeframe security demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The valid timeframe closest to 1/4 the size of the chart timeframe.
string lowerTimeframe = timeframe.from_seconds(int(timeframe.in_seconds() / 4))

//@variable The `close` value on the `lowerTimeframe`. Represents the first intrabar value on each chart bar.
float firstLTFClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, lowerTimeframe, close, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
//@variable The `close` value on the `lowerTimeframe`. Represents the last intrabar value on each chart bar.
float lastLTFClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, lowerTimeframe, close)

// Plot the values.
plot(firstLTFClose, "First intrabar close", color.teal, 3)
plot(lastLTFClose, "Last intrabar close", color.purple, 3)
// Highlight the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 70) : na, title = "Realtime background highlight")
```

Note that:

- The script determines the value of the `lowerTimeframe` by
  calculating the number of seconds in the chart timeframe with
  [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds),
  then dividing by four and converting the result to a
  [valid timeframe string](#timeframe-string-specifications) via
  [timeframe.from_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.from_seconds).
- The plot of the series without lookahead
  ([purple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.purple))
  aligns with the
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  value on the chart timeframe, as this is the last intrabar value
  in the chart bar.
- Both
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  calls return the *same* value (the current
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close))
  on each
  [realtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isrealtime)
  bar, as shown on the bars with the
  [orange](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_color.orange)
  background.
- Scripts can retrieve up to 200,000 intrabars from a lower-timeframe context. The number of chart bars with available intrabar data varies with the requested lower timeframe, the `calc_bars_count` value, and the user's plan. See [this](#intrabars) section of the [Limitations](#limitations) page.

### [Requestable data](https://www.tradingview.com#requestable-data)

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function is quite versatile, as it can retrieve values of any
fundamental type ([int](#int), [float](#float), [bool](#bool), [color](#color), or [string](#string)). It can also request the IDs of data structures and
built-in or
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types) that reference fundamental types. The data this function
requests depends on its `expression` parameter, which accepts any of the
following arguments:

- [Built-in variables and function calls](#built-in-variables-and-functions)
- [Variables declared by the script](#declared-variables)
- [Tuples](#tuples)
- [Calls to user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions)
- [Chart points](#chart-points)
- [Collections](#collections)
- [User-defined types](#user-defined-types)

#### [Built-in variables and functions](https://www.tradingview.com#built-in-variables-and-functions)

A frequent use case of
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
is requesting the output of a built-in variable or
function/[method](#methods) call from
another symbol or timeframe.

For example, suppose we want to calculate the 20-bar
[SMA](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
of a symbol's
[ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4)
price from the daily timeframe while on an intraday chart. We can
accomplish this with a single line of code:

```
float ma = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", ta.sma(ohlc4, 20))
```

The above line calculates the value of [ta.sma(ohlc4,
20)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
on the current symbol from the daily timeframe.

It's important to note that newcomers to Pine may sometimes confuse the
above line of code as being equivalent to the following:

```
float ma = ta.sma(request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", ohlc4), 20)
```

However, this line will return an entirely *different* result. Rather
than requesting a 20-bar SMA from the daily timeframe, it requests the
[ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4)
price from the daily timeframe and calclates the
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
of the results over 20 **chart bars**.

In essence, when the intention is to request the results of an
expression from other contexts, pass the expression *directly* to the
`expression` parameter in the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call, as demonstrated in the initial example.

Let's expand on this concept. The script below calculates a
multi-timeframe (MTF) ribbon of moving averages, where each moving
average in the ribbon calculates over the same number of bars on its
respective timeframe. Each
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call uses [ta.sma(close,
length)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
as its `expression` argument to return a `length`-bar SMA from the
specified timeframe:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-Built-in-variables-and-functions-1.CPvZdzBd_Z1LKRRo.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting built-ins demo", "MTF Ribbon", true)

//@variable The length of each moving average.
int length = input.int(20, "Length", 1)

//@variable The number of seconds in the chart timeframe.
int chartSeconds = timeframe.in_seconds()

// Calculate the higher timeframes closest to 2, 3, and 4 times the size of the chart timeframe.
string htf1 = timeframe.from_seconds(chartSeconds * 2)
string htf2 = timeframe.from_seconds(chartSeconds * 3)
string htf3 = timeframe.from_seconds(chartSeconds * 4)

// Calculate the `length`-bar moving averages from each timeframe.
float chartAvg = ta.sma(ohlc4, length)
float htfAvg1  = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf1, ta.sma(ohlc4, length))
float htfAvg2  = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf2, ta.sma(ohlc4, length))
float htfAvg3  = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf3, ta.sma(ohlc4, length))

// Plot the results.
plot(chartAvg, "Chart timeframe SMA", color.red, 3)
plot(htfAvg1, "Double timeframe SMA", color.orange, 3)
plot(htfAvg2, "Triple timeframe SMA", color.green, 3)
plot(htfAvg3, "Quadruple timeframe SMA", color.blue, 3)

// Highlight the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.aqua, 70) : na, title = "Realtime highlight")
```

Note that:

- The script calculates the ribbon's higher timeframes by
  multiplying the chart's
  [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds)
  value by 2, 3, and 4, then converting each result into a
  [valid timeframe string](#timeframe-string-specifications) using
  [timeframe.from_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.from_seconds).
- Instead of calling
  [ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
  within each
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call, one could use the `chartAvg` variable as the `expression`
  in each call to achieve the same result. See the
  [next section](#declared-variables) for more information.
- On realtime bars, this script also tracks *unconfirmed* SMA
  values from each higher timeframe. See the
  [Historical and realtime behavior](#historical-and-realtime-behavior) section to learn more.

#### [Declared variables](https://www.tradingview.com#declared-variables)

The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function's `expression` parameter can accept declared variables that are accessible to the scope from which the function call executes. When using a declared variable as the `expression` argument, the function call *duplicates* all *preceding code* that determines the assigned value or reference. This duplication allows the function to evaluate necessary calculations and logic in the requested context without affecting the original variable.

For instance, this line of code declares a `priceReturn` variable that holds the current bar's arithmetic price return:

```
float priceReturn = (close - close[1]) / close[1]
```

We can evaluate the `priceReturn` variable's calculations in another context by using it as the `expression` in a [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call. The call below duplicates the variable's calculation and evaluates it across the data from another `symbol`, returning a *separate series* adapted to the chart's time axis:

```
float requestedReturn = request.security(symbol, timeframe.period, priceReturn)
```

This example script compares the price returns of the current chart's symbol and a user-specified symbol. It calculates the value of the `priceReturn` variable, then uses that variable as the `expression` in a [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call to evaluate the calculation on the input symbol's data. After the request, the script calculates the [correlation](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.correlation) between the `priceReturn` and `requestedReturn` and [plots](#plots) the result on the chart:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-Calculated-variables-1.DpMsOLKI_Z6c3MD.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting calculated variables demo", "Price return correlation")

//@variable The symbol to compare to the chart symbol.
string symbol = input.symbol("SPY", "Symbol to compare")
//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int length = input.int(60, "Length", 1)

//@variable The close-to-close price return.
float priceReturn = (close - close[1]) / close[1]
//@variable The close-to-close price return calculated on another `symbol`.
float requestedReturn = request.security(symbol, timeframe.period, priceReturn)

//@variable The correlation between the `priceReturn` and `requestedReturn` over `length` bars.
float correlation = ta.correlation(priceReturn, requestedReturn, length)
//@variable The color of the correlation plot.
color plotColor = color.from_gradient(correlation, -1, 1, color.purple, color.orange)

// Plot the correlation value.
plot(correlation, "Correlation", plotColor, style = plot.style_area)
```

Note that:

- The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call executes the same calculation used in the `priceReturn` declaration, but the request's calculation operates on the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values from the specified symbol's data.
- The script colors the plot with a [gradient](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.from_gradient) based on the `correlation` value. See [this section](#colorfrom_gradient) of the [Colors](#colors) page to learn more about color gradients.

When using a variable as the `expression` argument of a `request.*()` call, it's important to note that the function only duplicates code that affects the variable *before* the call. It *cannot* copy any subsequent code following the call. Consequently, if the script reassigns the variable or modifies its referenced data *after* calling [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security), the code evaluated on the requested data **does not** include those additional operations.

For example, the following script declares a `counter` variable and calls [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) to evaluate the variable from the same context as the chart. After the call, the script increments the `counter` value by one with the addition assignment operator ([+=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_+=)), then uses plots and [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) to display the `counter` and `requestedCounter` values for comparison.

As shown below, the plots and logs of the two variables display *different* values. The `requestedCounter` variable has a consistent value of 0 because the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call only evaluates the initial variable declaration. The request cannot evaluate the addition assignment operation because the script includes that code *after* the function call:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-Declared-variables-2.DeWwelo7_ZvPFUy.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Modifying variables after requests demo")

//@variable A counter that starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each bar. 
var int counter = 0

//@variable Holds a consistent value of 0. 
//          `request.security()` cannot evaluate `counter += 1` in its requested context 
//          because that modification occurs *after* the call. 
int requestedCounter = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe.period, counter)

// Increment the `counter` by 1. This operation is *not* included in the `requestedCounter` calculation.
counter += 1

// Plot both variables for comparison. 
plot(counter, "Original counter", color.purple, 3)
plot(requestedCounter, "Requested counter", color.red, 3)

// Log the values of both variables in the Pine Logs pane.
if barstate.isconfirmed
    log.info("counter: {0}, requestedCounter: {1}", counter, requestedCounter)
```

#### [Tuples](https://www.tradingview.com#tuples)

[Tuples](#tuples) in Pine
Script™ are comma-separated sets of expressions enclosed in brackets
that can hold multiple values of any available type. We use tuples when
creating functions or other local blocks that return more than one
value.

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function can accept a tuple as its `expression` argument, allowing
scripts to request multiple series of different types using a single
function call. The expressions within requested tuples can be of any
type outlined throughout the
[Requestable data](#requestable-data) section of this page, excluding other tuples.

Tuples are particularly handy when a script needs to retrieve more than
one value from a specific context.

For example, this script calculates the [percent
rank](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.percentrank)
of the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price over `length` bars and assigns the expression to the `rank`
variable. It then calls
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to request a tuple containing the `rank`, [ta.crossover(rank,
50)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.crossover),
and [ta.crossunder(rank,
50)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.crossunder)
values from the specified `timeframe`. The script
[plots](#plots) the `requestedRank`
and uses the `crossOver` and `crossUnder` "bool" values within
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
to conditionally highlight the chart pane's background:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-Tuples-1.DfMFJD2A_22M4RL.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting tuples demo", "Percent rank cross")

//@variable The timeframe of the request.
string timeframe = input.timeframe("240", "Timeframe")
//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int length = input.int(20, "Length")

//@variable The previous bar's percent rank of the `close` price over `length` bars.
float rank = ta.percentrank(close, length)[1]

// Request the `rank` value from another `timeframe`, and two "bool" values indicating the `rank` from the `timeframe`
// crossed over or under 50.
[requestedRank, crossOver, crossUnder] = request.security(
     syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, [rank, ta.crossover(rank, 50), ta.crossunder(rank, 50)],
     lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on
 )

// Plot the `requestedRank` and create a horizontal line at 50.
plot(requestedRank, "Percent Rank", linewidth = 3)
hline(50, "Cross line", linewidth = 2)
// Highlight the background of all bars where the `timeframe`'s `crossOver` or `crossUnder` value is `true`.
bgcolor(crossOver ? color.new(color.green, 50) : crossUnder ? color.new(color.red, 50) : na)
```

Note that:

- We've offset the `rank` variable's expression by one bar using
  the history-referencing operator
  [[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
  and included
  [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
  in the
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call to ensure the values on realtime bars do not repaint after
  becoming historical bars. See the
  [Avoiding repainting](#avoiding-repainting) section for more information.
- The
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call returns a tuple, so we use a *tuple declaration* to declare
  the `requestedRank`, `crossOver`, and `crossUnder` variables. To
  learn more about using tuples, see
  [this section](#tuples) of our User Manual's
  [Type system](#type-system)
  page.

#### [User-defined functions](https://www.tradingview.com#user-defined-functions)

[User-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) and
[methods](#user-defined-methods)
are custom functions written by users. They allow users to define
sequences of operations associated with an identifier that scripts can
conveniently call throughout their executions (e.g., `myUDF()`).

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function can request the results of
[user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) and
[methods](#user-defined-methods)
whose scopes consist of any types outlined throughout this page's
[Requestable data](#requestable-data) section.

For example, this script contains a user-defined `weightedBB()` function
that calculates Bollinger Bands with the basis average weighted by a
specified `weight` series. The function returns a
[tuple](#tuples) of custom
band values. The script calls the `weightedBB()` as the `expression`
argument in
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to retrieve a
[tuple](#tuples) of band values calculated on the specified `timeframe` and
[plots](#plots) the results on the
chart:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-User-defined-functions-1.DTi5QOZX_ZMtoWB.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting user-defined functions demo", "Weighted Bollinger Bands", true)

//@variable The timeframe of the request.
string timeframe = input.timeframe("480", "Timeframe")

//@function     Calculates Bollinger Bands with a custom weighted basis.
//@param source The series of values to process.
//@param length The number of bars in the calculation.
//@param mult   The standard deviation multiplier.
//@param weight The series of weights corresponding to each `source` value.
//@returns      A tuple containing the basis, upper band, and lower band respectively.
weightedBB(float source, int length, float mult = 2.0, float weight = 1.0) =>
    //@variable The basis of the bands.
    float ma = math.sum(source * weight, length) / math.sum(weight, length)
    //@variable The standard deviation from the `ma`.
    float dev = 0.0
    // Loop to accumulate squared error.
    for i = 0 to length - 1
        difference = source[i] - ma
        dev += difference * difference
    // Divide `dev` by the `length`, take the square root, and multiply by the `mult`.
    dev := math.sqrt(dev / length) * mult
    // Return the bands.
    [ma, ma + dev, ma - dev]

// Request weighted bands calculated on the chart symbol's prices over 20 bars from the
// last confirmed bar on the `timeframe`.
[basis, highBand, lowBand] = request.security(
     syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, weightedBB(close[1], 20, 2.0, (high - low)[1]), lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on
 )

// Plot the values.
basisPlot = plot(basis, "Basis", color.orange, 2)
upperPlot = plot(highBand, "Upper", color.teal, 2)
lowerPlot = plot(lowBand, "Lower", color.maroon, 2)
fill(upperPlot, lowerPlot, color.new(color.gray, 90), "Background")
```

Note that:

- We offset the `source` and `weight` arguments in the
  `weightedBB()` call used as the `expression` in
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  and used
  [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
  to ensure the requested results reflect the last confirmed
  values from the `timeframe` on realtime bars. See
  [this section](#avoiding-repainting) to learn more.

#### [Chart points](https://www.tradingview.com#chart-points)

[Chart points](#chart-points) are reference types that represent coordinates on the chart.
[Lines](#lines),
[boxes](#boxes),
[polylines](#polylines),
and [labels](#labels)
use
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
objects to set their display locations.

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function can use the ID of a
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
instance in its `expression` argument, allowing scripts to retrieve
chart coordinates from other contexts.

The example below requests a tuple of historical
[chart points](#chart-points) from a higher timeframe and uses them to draw
[boxes](#boxes) on the
chart. The script declares the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` variables
that reference
[chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_chart.point)
IDs from the last confirmed bar. It then uses
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to request a
[tuple](#tuples) containing the IDs of
[chart points](#chart-points) representing the `topLeft` and `bottomRight` from a
`higherTimeframe`.

When a new bar starts on the `higherTimeframe`, the script draws a [new
box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
using the `time` and `price` coordinates from the `requestedTopLeft` and
`requestedBottomRight` chart points:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-Chart-points-1.C5dKnJ3R_Z1YxlJR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting chart points demo", "HTF Boxes", true, max_boxes_count = 500)

//@variable The timeframe to request data from.
string higherTimeframe = input.timeframe("1D", "Timeframe")

// Raise a runtime error if the `higherTimeframe` is smaller than the chart's timeframe.
if timeframe.in_seconds(higherTimeframe) < timeframe.in_seconds(timeframe.period)
    runtime.error("The selected timeframe is too small. Choose a higher timeframe.")

//@variable A `chart.point` containing top-left coordinates from the last confirmed bar.
topLeft = chart.point.now(high)[1]
//@variable A `chart.point` containing bottom-right coordinates from the last confirmed bar.
bottomRight = chart.point.from_time(time_close, low)[1]

// Request the last confirmed `topLeft` and `bottomRight` chart points from the `higherTimeframe`.
[requestedTopLeft, requestedBottomRight] = request.security(
     syminfo.tickerid, higherTimeframe, [topLeft, bottomRight], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on
 )

// Draw a new box when a new `higherTimeframe` bar starts.
// The box uses the `time` fields from the `requestedTopLeft` and `requestedBottomRight` as x-coordinates.
if timeframe.change(higherTimeframe)
    box.new(
         requestedTopLeft, requestedBottomRight, color.purple, 3, 
         xloc = xloc.bar_time, bgcolor = color.new(color.purple, 90)
     )
```

Note that:

- Since this example is designed specifically for higher
  timeframes, we've included a custom [runtime
  error](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_runtime.error)
  that the script raises when the
  [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds)
  of the `higherTimeframe` is smaller than that of the [chart's
  timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period).

#### [Collections](https://www.tradingview.com#collections)

Pine Script™ *collections* ([arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices),
and [maps](#maps)) are data structures
that contain an arbitrary number of elements with specified types. The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function can retrieve the IDs of
[collections](#collections) whose elements consist of:

- Fundamental types
- [Chart points](#chart-points)
- [User-defined types](#user-defined-types) that satisfy the criteria listed in the
  [section below](#user-defined-types)

This example calculates the ratio of a confirmed bar's high-low range
to the range between the
[highest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
and
[lowest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.lowest)
values over 10 bars from a specified `symbol` and `timeframe`. It uses
[maps](#maps) to hold the values used
in the calculations.

The script creates a `data` map with "string" keys and "float"
values to hold
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low),
[highest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest),
and
[lowest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.lowest)
price values on each bar, which it uses as the `expression` in
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to calculate an `otherData` map representing the `data` from the
specified context. It uses the values associated with the "High",
"Low", "Highest", and "Lowest" keys of the `otherData` map to
calculate the `ratio` that it [plots](#plots) in the chart pane:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-Collections-1.C6G31C3k_2bffgq.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting collections demo", "Bar range ratio")

//@variable The ticker ID to request data from.
string symbol = input.symbol("", "Symbol")
//@variable The timeframe of the request.
string timeframe = input.timeframe("30", "Timeframe")

//@variable A map with "string" keys and "float" values.
var map<string, float> data = map.new<string, float>()

// Put key-value pairs into the `data` map.
map.put(data, "High", high)
map.put(data, "Low", low)
map.put(data, "Highest", ta.highest(10))
map.put(data, "Lowest", ta.lowest(10))

//@variable A new `map` whose data is calculated from the last confirmed bar of the requested context.
map<string, float> otherData = request.security(symbol, timeframe, data[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

//@variable The ratio of the context's bar range to the max range over 10 bars. Returns `na` if no data is available.
float ratio = na
if not na(otherData)
    ratio := (otherData.get("High") - otherData.get("Low")) / (otherData.get("Highest") - otherData.get("Lowest"))

//@variable A gradient color for the plot of the `ratio`.
color ratioColor = color.from_gradient(ratio, 0, 1, color.purple, color.orange)

// Plot the `ratio`.
plot(ratio, "Range Ratio", ratioColor, 3, plot.style_area)
```

Note that:

- The
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call in this script can return
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  if no data is available from the specified context. Since one
  cannot call [methods](#methods) on a
  [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
  variable when its value is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
  we've added an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  structure to only calculate a new `ratio` value when `otherData`
  references a valid
  [map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
  ID.

#### [User-defined types](https://www.tradingview.com#user-defined-types)

[User-defined types (UDTs)](#user-defined-types) are *composite types* containing an arbitrary number of
*fields*, which can be of any available type, including other
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types).

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function can retrieve the IDs of
[objects](#objects) produced by
[UDTs](#user-defined-types)
from other contexts if their fields consist of:

- Fundamental types
- [Chart points](#chart-points)
- [Collections](#collections) that satisfy the criteria listed in the
  [section above](#collections)
- Other [UDTs](#user-defined-types) whose fields consist of any of these types

The following example requests an
[object](#objects) ID using a
specified `symbol` and displays its field values on a chart pane.

The script contains a `TickerInfo` UDT with "string" fields for
`syminfo.*` values, an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
field to store recent "float" price data, and an "int" field to hold
the requested ticker's
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
value. It assigns a new `TickerInfo` ID to an `info` variable on every
bar and uses the variable as the `expression` in
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to retrieve the ID of an [object](#objects) representing the calculated `info` from the specified
`symbol`.

The script displays the `requestedInfo` object's `description`,
`tickerType`, `currency`, and `barIndex` values in a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
and uses
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
to display the values from its `prices` array:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-Requestable-data-User-defined-types-1.D90DRv4r_1OUO19.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting user-defined types demo", "Ticker info")

//@variable The symbol to request information from.
string symbol = input.symbol("NASDAQ:AAPL", "Symbol")

//@type               A custom type containing information about a ticker.
//@field description  The symbol's description.
//@field tickerType   The type of ticker.
//@field currency     The symbol's currency.
//@field prices       An array of the symbol's current prices.
//@field barIndex     The ticker's `bar_index`.
type TickerInfo
    string       description
    string       tickerType
    string       currency
    array<float> prices
    int          barIndex

//@variable A `TickerInfo` object containing current data.
info = TickerInfo.new(
     syminfo.description, syminfo.type, syminfo.currency, array.from(open, high, low, close), bar_index
 )
//@variable The `info` requested from the specified `symbol`.
TickerInfo requestedInfo = request.security(symbol, timeframe.period, info)
// Assign a new `TickerInfo` instance to `requestedInfo` if one wasn't retrieved.
if na(requestedInfo)
    requestedInfo := TickerInfo.new(prices = array.new<float>(4))

//@variable A label displaying information from the `requestedInfo` object.
var infoLabel = label.new(
     na, na, "", color = color.purple, style = label.style_label_left, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large
 )
//@variable The text to display inside the `infoLabel`.
string infoText = na(requestedInfo) ? "" : str.format(
     "{0}\nType: {1}\nCurrency: {2}\nBar Index: {3}",
     requestedInfo.description, requestedInfo.tickerType, requestedInfo.currency, requestedInfo.barIndex
 )

// Set the `point` and `text` of the `infoLabel`.
label.set_point(infoLabel, chart.point.now(array.last(requestedInfo.prices)))
label.set_text(infoLabel, infoText)
// Plot candles using the values from the `prices` array of the `requestedInfo`.
plotcandle(
     requestedInfo.prices.get(0), requestedInfo.prices.get(1), requestedInfo.prices.get(2), requestedInfo.prices.get(3),
     "Requested Prices"
 )
```

Note that:

- The `syminfo.*` variables used in this script all return
  "simple string" qualified types. However,
  [objects](#objects) in Pine
  are *always* qualified as "series". Consequently, all values
  assigned to the `info` object's fields automatically adopt the
  "series"
  [qualifier](#qualifiers).
- It is possible for the
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call to return
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  due to differences between the data requested from the `symbol`
  and the main chart. This script assigns a new `TickerInfo`
  object to the `requestedInfo` in that case to prevent runtime
  errors.

## [`request.security_lower_tf()`](https://www.tradingview.com#requestsecurity_lower_tf)

The
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
function is an alternative to
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
designed for reliably requesting information from lower-timeframe (LTF)
contexts.

While
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
can retrieve data from a *single* intrabar (LTF bar) in each chart bar,
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
retrieves data from *all* available intrabars in each chart bar, which
the script can access and use in additional calculations. Each
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
call can retrieve up to 200,000 intrabars from a lower timeframe, depending on the user's [plan](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/). See
[this](#request-calls)
section of our [Limitations](#limitations) page for more information.

Below is the function's signature, which is similar to
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security):

```
request.security_lower_tf(symbol, timeframe, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, ignore_invalid_timeframe, calc_bars_count) → array<type>
```

This function **only** requests data from timeframes less than or equal
to the chart's timeframe. If the `timeframe` of the request represents
a higher timeframe than the [chart's
timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period),
the function will either raise a runtime error or return
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values depending on the `ignore_invalid_timeframe` argument in the call.
The default value for this parameter is `false`, meaning it raises
an error and halt the script's executions when attempting to request HTF
data.

### [Requesting intrabar data](https://www.tradingview.com#requesting-intrabar-data)

Intrabar data can provide a script with additional information that may
not be obvious or accessible from solely analyzing data sampled on the
chart's timerframe. The
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
function can retrieve many data types from an intrabar context.

Before you venture further in this section, we recommend exploring the
[Requestable data](#requestable-data) portion of the
[request.security()](#requestsecurity) section above, which provides foundational information about
the types of data one can request. The `expression` parameter in
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
accepts most of the same arguments discussed in that section, excluding
direct references to
[collections](#collections) and mutable variables declared in the script's main scope.
Although it accepts many of the same types of arguments, this function
returns
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
results, which comes with some differences in interpretation and
handling, as explained below.

### [Intrabar data arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#intrabar-data-arrays)

Lower timeframes contain more data points than higher timeframes, as new
values come in at a *higher frequency*. For example, when comparing a
1-minute chart to an hourly chart, the 1-minute chart will have up to 60
times the number of bars per hour, depending on the available data.

To address the fact that multiple intrabars exist within a chart bar,
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
always returns its results as [arrays](#arrays). The elements in the returned
[arrays](#arrays) represent the
`expression` values retrieved from the lower timeframe sorted in
ascending order based on each intrabar's timestamp.

The [type template](#type-templates) assigned to the returned
[arrays](#arrays) corresponds to the
value types passed in the
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
call. For example, using an "int" as the `expression` will produce an
`array<int>` instance, a "bool" as the `expression` will produce an
`array<bool>` instance, etc.

The following script uses intrabar information to decompose the chart's
close-to-close price changes into positive and negative parts. It calls
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
to fetch a "float"
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of
[ta.change(close)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change)
values from the `lowerTimeframe` on each chart bar, then accesses all
the array's elements using a
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop to accumulate `positiveChange` and `negativeChange` sums. The
script adds the accumulated values to calculate the `netChange`, then
[plots](#plots) the results on the
chart alongside the `priceChange` for comparison:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-lower-tf-Intrabar-data-arrays-1.BFy5KmoZ_CQoK9.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Intrabar arrays demo", "Intrabar price changes")

//@variable The lower timeframe of the requested data.
string lowerTimeframe = input.timeframe("1", "Timeframe")

//@variable The close-to-close price change.
float priceChange = ta.change(close)

//@variable An array of `close` values from available intrabars on the `lowerTimeframe`.
array<float> intrabarChanges = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, lowerTimeframe, priceChange)

//@variable The total positive intrabar `close` movement on the chart bar.
float positiveChange = 0.0
//@variable The total negative intrabar `close` movement on the chart bar.
float negativeChange = 0.0

// Loop to calculate totals, starting from the chart bar's first available intrabar.
for change in intrabarChanges
    // Add the `change` to `positiveChange` if its sign is 1, and add to `negativeChange` if its sign is -1.
    switch math.sign(change)
        1  => positiveChange += change
        -1 => negativeChange += change

//@variable The sum of `positiveChange` and `negativeChange`. Equals the `priceChange` on bars with available intrabars.
float netChange = positiveChange + negativeChange

// Plot the `positiveChange`, `negativeChange`, and `netChange`.
plot(positiveChange, "Positive intrabar change", color.teal, style = plot.style_area)
plot(negativeChange, "Negative intrabar change", color.maroon, style = plot.style_area)
plot(netChange, "Net intrabar change", color.yellow, 5)
// Plot the `priceChange` to compare.
plot(priceChange, "Chart price change", color.orange, 2)
```

Note that:

- The [plots](#plots) based on
  intrabar data may not appear on all available chart bars, as
  [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
  can only access up to the most recent 200,000 intrabars
  available from the requested context. When executing this
  function on a chart bar that doesn't have accessible intrabar
  data, it will return an *empty array*.
- The number of intrabars per chart bar may vary depending on the
  data available from the context and the chart the script
  executes on. For example, a provider's 1-minute data feed may
  not include data for every minute within the 60-minute timeframe
  due to a lack of trading activity over some 1-minute intervals.
  To check the number of intrabars retrieved for a chart bar, one
  can use
  [array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
  on the resulting
  [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).
- If the `lowerTimeframe` value is greater than the chart's
  timeframe, the script will raise a *runtime error*, as we have
  not supplied an `ignore_invalid_timeframe` argument in the
  [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
  call.

### [Tuples of intrabar data](https://www.tradingview.com#tuples-of-intrabar-data)

When passing a tuple or a function call that returns a tuple as the
`expression` argument in
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf),
the result is a tuple of [arrays](#arrays) with
[type templates](#type-templates) corresponding to the types within the argument. For example,
using a `[float, string, color]` tuple as the `expression` will result
in `[array<float>, array<string>, array<color>]` data returned by the
function. Using a tuple `expression` allows a script to fetch several
[arrays](#arrays) of intrabar data
with a single
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
function call.

The following example requests OHLC data from a lower timeframe and
visualizes the current bar's intrabars on the chart using
[lines and boxes](#lines-and-boxes). The
script calls
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
with the `[open, high, low, close]` tuple as its `expression` to
retrieve a tuple of [arrays](#arrays)
representing OHLC information from a calculated `lowerTimeframe`. It
then uses a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
to set line coordinates with the retrieved data and current bar indices
to display the results next to the current chart bar, providing a
"magnified view" of the price movement within the latest candle. It
also draws a
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
around the [lines](#lines) to indicate the chart region occupied by intrabar drawings:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-lower-tf-Tuples-of-intrabar-data-1.C8-f9Sez_Z96QYf.png)

```
//@version=6

//@variable The maximum number of intrabars to display.
int maxIntrabars = input.int(20, "Max intrabars", 1, 250)
//@variable The width of the drawn candle bodies.
int candleWidth = input.int(20, "Candle width", 2)

//@variable The largest valid timeframe closest to `maxIntrabars` times smaller than the chart timeframe.
string lowerTimeframe = timeframe.from_seconds(math.ceil(timeframe.in_seconds() / maxIntrabars))

//@variable An array of lines to represent intrabar wicks.
var array<line> wicks  = array.new<line>()
//@variable An array of lines to represent intrabar bodies.
var array<line> bodies = array.new<line>()
//@variable A box that surrounds the displayed intrabars.
var box magnifierBox = box.new(na, na, na, na, bgcolor = na)

// Fill the `wicks` and `bodies` arrays with blank lines on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    for i = 1 to maxIntrabars
        array.push(wicks, line.new(na, na, na, na, color = color.gray))
        array.push(bodies, line.new(na, na, na, na, width = candleWidth))

//@variable A tuple of "float" arrays containing `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` prices from the `lowerTimeframe`.
[oData, hData, lData, cData] = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, lowerTimeframe, [open, high, low, close])
//@variable The number of intrabars retrieved from the `lowerTimeframe` on the chart bar.
int numIntrabars = array.size(oData)

if numIntrabars > 0
    // Define the start and end bar index values for intrabar display.
    int startIndex = bar_index + 2
    int endIndex = startIndex + numIntrabars
    // Loop to update lines.
    for i = 0 to maxIntrabars - 1
        line wickLine = array.get(wicks, i)
        line bodyLine = array.get(bodies, i)
        if i < numIntrabars
            //@variable The `bar_index` of the drawing.
            int candleIndex = startIndex + i
            // Update the properties of the `wickLine` and `bodyLine`.
            line.set_xy1(wickLine, startIndex + i, array.get(hData, i))
            line.set_xy2(wickLine, startIndex + i, array.get(lData, i))
            line.set_xy1(bodyLine, startIndex + i, array.get(oData, i))
            line.set_xy2(bodyLine, startIndex + i, array.get(cData, i))
            line.set_color(bodyLine, bodyLine.get_y2() > bodyLine.get_y1() ? color.teal : color.maroon)
            continue
        // Set the coordinates of the `wickLine` and `bodyLine` to `na` if no intrabar data is available at the index.
        line.set_xy1(wickLine, na, na)
        line.set_xy2(wickLine, na, na)
        line.set_xy1(bodyLine, na, na)
        line.set_xy2(bodyLine, na, na)
    // Set the coordinates of the `magnifierBox`.
    box.set_lefttop(magnifierBox, startIndex - 1, array.max(hData))
    box.set_rightbottom(magnifierBox, endIndex, array.min(lData))
```

Note that:

- The script draws each candle using two
  [lines](#lines):
  one to represent wicks and the other to represent the body.
  Since the script can display up to 500 lines on the chart,
  we've limited the `maxIntrabars` input to 250.
- The `lowerTimeframe` value is the result of calculating the
  [math.ceil()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.ceil)
  of the
  [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds)
  divided by the `maxIntrabars` and converting to a
  [valid timeframe string](#timeframe-string-specifications) with
  [timeframe.from_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.from_seconds).
- The script sets the top of the box drawing using the
  [array.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.max)
  of the requested `hData` array, and it sets the box's bottom
  using the
  [array.min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min)
  of the requested `lData` array. As we see on the chart, these
  values correspond to the
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
  and
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
  of the chart bar.

### [Requesting collections](https://www.tradingview.com#requesting-collections)

In some cases, a script may need to request the IDs of
[collections](#collections) from an intrabar context. However, unlike
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security),
one cannot pass
[collections](#collections) or calls to functions that return them as the `expression`
argument in a
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
call, as [arrays](#arrays) cannot
directly reference other
[collections](#collections).

Despite these limitations, it is possible to request
[collections](#collections) from lower timeframes, if needed, with the help of *wrapper*
types.

To make
[collections](#collections) requestable with
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf),
we must create a
[UDT](#user-defined-types)
with a field to reference a collection ID. This step is necessary since
[arrays](#arrays) cannot reference
other [collections](#collections) directly but *can* reference UDTs with collection fields:

```
//@type A "wrapper" type to hold an `array<float>` instance.
type Wrapper
    array<float> collection
```

With our `Wrapper` UDT defined, we can now pass the IDs of
[objects](#objects) of the UDT to the
`expression` parameter in
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf).

A straightforward approach is to call the built-in `*.new()` function as
the `expression`. For example, this line of code calls `Wrapper.new()`
with
[array.from(close)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.from)
as its `collection` within
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf):

```
//@variable An array of `Wrapper` IDs requested from the 1-minute timeframe.
array<Wrapper> wrappers = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", Wrapper.new(array.from(close)))
```

Alternatively, we can create a
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) or
[method](#user-defined-methods)
that returns an [object](#objects) of
the [UDT](#user-defined-types) and call that function within
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf).
For instance, this code calls a custom `newWrapper()` function that
returns a `Wrapper` ID as the `expression` argument:

```
//@function Creates a new `Wrapper` instance to wrap the specified `collection`.
newWrapper(array<float> collection) =>
    Wrapper.new(collection)

//@variable An array of `Wrapper` IDs requested from the 1-minute timeframe.
array<Wrapper> wrappers = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", newWrapper(array.from(close)))
```

The result with either of the above is an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
containing `Wrapper` IDs from all available intrabars in the chart bar,
which the script can use to reference `Wrapper` instances from specific
intrabars and use their `collection` fields in additional operations.

The script below utilizes this approach to collect
[arrays](#arrays) of intrabar data
from a `lowerTimeframe` and uses them to display data from a specific
intrabar. Its custom `Prices` type contains a single `data` field to
reference `array<float>` instances that hold price data, and the
user-defined `newPrices()` function returns the ID of a `Prices` object.

The script calls
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
with a `newPrices()` call as its `expression` argument to retrieve an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of `Prices` IDs from each intrabar in the chart bar, then uses
[array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get)
to get the ID from a specified available intrabar, if it exists. Lastly,
it uses
[array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get)
on the `data` array assigned to that instance and calls
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
to display its values on the chart:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-security-lower-tf-Requesting-collections-1.D61W65Jj_gcc0V.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting LTF collections demo", "Intrabar viewer", true)

//@variable The timeframe of the LTF data request.
string lowerTimeframe = input.timeframe("1", "Timeframe")
//@variable The index of the intrabar to show on each chart bar. 0 is the first available intrabar.
int intrabarIndex = input.int(0, "Intrabar to show", 0)

//@variable A custom type to hold an array of price `data`.
type Prices
    array<float> data

//@function Returns a new `Prices` instance containing current `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` prices.
newPrices() =>
    Prices.new(array.from(open, high, low, close))

//@variable An array of `Prices` requested from the `lowerTimeframe`.
array<Prices> requestedPrices = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, lowerTimeframe, newPrices())

//@variable The `Prices` ID from the `requestedPrices` array at the `intrabarIndex`, or `na` if not available.
Prices intrabarPrices = array.size(requestedPrices) > intrabarIndex ? array.get(requestedPrices, intrabarIndex) : na
//@variable The `data` array from the `intrabarPrices`, or an array of `na` values if `intrabarPrices` is `na`.
array<float> intrabarData = na(intrabarPrices) ? array.new<float>(4, na) : intrabarPrices.data

// Plot the `intrabarData` values as candles.
plotcandle(intrabarData.get(0), intrabarData.get(1), intrabarData.get(2), intrabarData.get(3))
```

Note that:

- The `intrabarPrices` variable only references a `Prices` ID if
  the
  [size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
  of the `requestedPrices` array is greater than the
  `intrabarIndex`, as attempting to use
  [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get)
  to get an element that doesn't exist will result in an
  [out of bounds error](#index-xx-is-out-of-bounds-array-size-is-yy).
- The `intrabarData` variable only references the `data` field
  from `intrabarPrices` if a valid `Prices` ID exists since a
  script cannot reference fields of an
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  value.
- The process used in this example is *not* necessary to achieve
  the intended result. We could instead avoid using
  [UDTs](#user-defined-types) and pass an `[open, high, low, close]` tuple to the
  `expression` parameter to retrieve a tuple of
  [arrays](#arrays) for further
  operations, as explained in the
  [previous section](#tuples-of-intrabar-data).

## [Custom contexts](https://www.tradingview.com#custom-contexts)

Pine Script™ includes multiple `ticker.*()` functions that allow scripts
to construct *custom* ticker IDs that specify additional settings for
data requests when used as a `symbol` argument in
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
and
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf):

- [ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.new)
  constructs a custom ticker ID from a specified `prefix` and `ticker`
  with additional `session` and `adjustment` settings.
- [ticker.modify()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.modify)
  constructs a modified form of a specified `tickerid` with additional
  `session` and `adjustment` settings.
- [ticker.heikinashi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.heikinashi),
  [ticker.renko()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.renko),
  [ticker.pointfigure()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.pointfigure),
  [ticker.kagi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.kagi),
  and
  [ticker.linebreak()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.linebreak)
  construct a modified form a `symbol` with
  [non-standard chart](#non-standard-charts-data) settings.
- [ticker.inherit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.inherit)
  constructs a new ticker ID for a `symbol` with additional parameters
  inherited from the `from_tickerid` specified in the function call,
  allowing scripts to request the `symbol` data with the same
  modifiers as the `from_tickerid`, including session, dividend
  adjustment, currency conversion, non-standard chart type,
  back-adjustment, settlement-as-close, etc.
- [ticker.standard()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.standard)
  constructs a standard ticker ID representing the `symbol`*without*
  additional modifiers.

Let's explore some practical examples of applying `ticker.*()`
functions to request data from custom contexts.

Suppose we want to include dividend adjustment in a stock symbol's
prices without enabling the "Adjust data for dividends" option in the
"Symbol" section of the chart's settings. We can achieve this in a
script by constructing a custom ticker ID for the instrument using
[ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.new)
or
[ticker.modify()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.modify)
with an `adjustment` value of
[adjustment.dividends](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_adjustment.dividends).

This script creates an `adjustedTickerID` using
[ticker.modify()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.modify),
uses that ticker ID as the `symbol` in
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to retrieve a
[tuple](#tuples) of adjusted price values, then plots the result as
[candles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
on the chart. It also highlights the background when the requested
prices differ from the prices without dividend adjustment.

As we see on the "NYSE:XOM" chart below, enabling dividend adjustment
results in different historical values before the date of the latest
dividend:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Custom-contexts-1.BPiSCB0G_ZpUr3u.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Custom contexts demo 1", "Adjusted prices", true)

//@variable A custom ticker ID representing the chart's symbol with the dividend adjustment modifier.
string adjustedTickerID = ticker.modify(syminfo.tickerid, adjustment = adjustment.dividends)

// Request the adjusted prices for the chart's symbol.
[o, h, l, c] = request.security(adjustedTickerID, timeframe.period, [open, high, low, close])

//@variable The color of the candles on the chart.
color candleColor = c > o ? color.teal : color.maroon

// Plot the adjusted prices.
plotcandle(o, h, l, c, "Adjusted Prices", candleColor)
// Highlight the background when `c` is different from `close`.
bgcolor(c != close ? color.new(color.orange, 80) : na)
```

Note that:

- If a modifier included in a constructed ticker ID does not apply
  to the symbol, the script will *ignore* that modifier when
  requesting data. For instance, this script will display the same
  values as the main chart on forex symbols such as "EURUSD".

While the example above demonstrates a simple way to modify the chart's
symbol, a more frequent use case for `ticker.*()` functions is applying
custom modifiers to another symbol while requesting data. If a ticker ID
referenced in a script already has the modifiers one would like to apply
(e.g., adjustment settings, session type, etc.), they can use
[ticker.inherit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.inherit)
to quickly and efficiently add those modifiers to another symbol.

In the example below, we've edited the previous script to request data
for a `symbolInput` using modifiers inherited from the
`adjustedTickerID`. This script calls
[ticker.inherit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.inherit)
to construct an `inheritedTickerID` and uses that ticker ID in a
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call. It also requests data for the `symbolInput` without additional
modifiers and plots
[candles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
for both ticker IDs in a separate chart pane to compare the difference.

As shown on the chart, the data requested using the `inheritedTickerID`
includes dividend adjustment, whereas the data requested using the
`symbolInput` directly does not:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Custom-contexts-2.DR5Qn5x1_Z1F3irE.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Custom contexts demo 2", "Inherited adjustment")

//@variable The symbol to request data from.
string symbolInput = input.symbol("NYSE:PFE", "Symbol")

//@variable A custom ticker ID representing the chart's symbol with the dividend adjustment modifier.
string adjustedTickerID = ticker.modify(syminfo.tickerid, adjustment = adjustment.dividends)
//@variable A custom ticker ID representing the `symbolInput` with modifiers inherited from the `adjustedTickerID`.
string inheritedTickerID = ticker.inherit(adjustedTickerID, symbolInput)

// Request prices using the `symbolInput`.
[o1, h1, l1, c1] = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, [open, high, low, close])
// Request prices using the `inheritedTickerID`.
[o2, h2, l2, c2] = request.security(inheritedTickerID, timeframe.period, [open, high, low, close])

//@variable The color of the candles that use the `inheritedTickerID` prices.
color candleColor = c2 > o2 ? color.teal : color.maroon

// Plot the `symbol` prices.
plotcandle(o1, h1, l1, c1, "Symbol", color.gray, color.gray, bordercolor = color.gray)
// Plot the `inheritedTickerID` prices.
plotcandle(o2, h2, l2, c2, "Symbol With Modifiers", candleColor)
// Highlight the background when `c1` is different from `c2`.
bgcolor(c1 != c2 ? color.new(color.orange, 80) : na)
```

Note that:

- Since the `adjustedTickerID` represents a modified form of the
  [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid),
  if we modify the chart's context in other ways, such as
  changing the chart type or enabling extended trading hours in
  the chart's settings, those modifiers will also apply to the
  `adjustedTickerID` and `inheritedTickerID`. However, they will
  *not* apply to the `symbolInput` since it represents a
  *standard* ticker ID.

Another frequent use case for requesting custom contexts is retrieving
data that uses
[non-standard chart](#non-standard-charts-data) calculations. For example, suppose we want to use
[Renko](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502284-renko-charts/)
price values to calculate trade signals in a
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
script. If we simply change the chart type to "Renko" to get the
prices, the [strategy](#strategies)
will also simulate its trades based on those synthetic prices, producing
[misleading
results](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000481029/):

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Custom-contexts-3.Fi6i41m5_Z15B7Id.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy(
     "Custom contexts demo 3", "Renko strategy", true, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity,
     default_qty_value = 2, initial_capital = 50000, slippage = 2,
     commission_type = strategy.commission.cash_per_contract, commission_value = 1, margin_long = 100,
     margin_short = 100
 )

//@variable When `true`, the strategy places a long market order.
bool longEntry = ta.crossover(close, open)
//@variable When `true`, the strategy places a short market order.
bool shortEntry = ta.crossunder(close, open)

if longEntry
    strategy.entry("Long Entry", strategy.long)
if shortEntry
    strategy.entry("Short Entry", strategy.short)
```

To ensure our strategy shows results based on *actual* prices, we can
create a Renko ticker ID using
[ticker.renko()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.renko)
while keeping the chart on a *standard type*, allowing the script to
request and use
[Renko](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502284-renko-charts/)
prices to calculate its signals without calculating the strategy results
on them:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Custom-contexts-4.DB0_6eO1_Z2gBlFY.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy(
     "Custom contexts demo 3", "Renko strategy", true, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity,
     default_qty_value = 2, initial_capital = 50000, slippage = 1,
     commission_type = strategy.commission.cash_per_contract, commission_value = 1, margin_long = 100,
     margin_short = 100
 )

//@variable A Renko ticker ID.
string renkoTickerID = ticker.renko(syminfo.tickerid, "ATR", 14)
// Request the `open` and `close` prices using the `renkoTickerID`.
[renkoOpen, renkoClose] = request.security(renkoTickerID, timeframe.period, [open, close])

//@variable When `true`, the strategy places a long market order.
bool longEntry = ta.crossover(renkoClose, renkoOpen)
//@variable When `true`, the strategy places a short market order.
bool shortEntry = ta.crossunder(renkoClose, renkoOpen)

if longEntry
    strategy.entry("Long Entry", strategy.long)
if shortEntry
    strategy.entry("Short Entry", strategy.short)

plot(renkoOpen)
plot(renkoClose)
```

## [Historical and realtime behavior](https://www.tradingview.com#historical-and-realtime-behavior)

Functions in the `request.*()` namespace can behave differently on
historical and realtime bars. This behavior is closely related to
Pine's [Execution model](#execution-model).

Consider how a script behaves within the main context. Throughout the
chart's history, the script calculates its required values once and
*commits* them to that bar so their states are accessible on subsequent executions.
On an unconfirmed bar, however, the script recalculates its
values on *each update* to the bar's data to align with realtime
changes. Before recalculating the values on that bar, it reverts
calculated values to their last committed states, otherwise known as
*rollback*, and it only commits values to that bar once the bar closes.

Now consider the behavior of data requests from other contexts with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security).
As when evaluating historical bars in the main context,
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
only returns new historical values when it confirms a bar in its
specified context. When executing on realtime bars, it returns
recalculated values on each chart bar, similar to how a script
recalculates values in the main context on the open chart bar.

However, the function only *confirms* the requested values when a bar
from its context closes. When the script restarts, what
were previously *realtime* bars become *historical* bars.
Therefore,
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
only returns the values it confirmed on those bars. In essence, this
behavior means that requested data may *repaint* when its values
fluctuate on realtime bars without confirmation from the context.

In most circumstances where a script requests data from a broader
context, one will typically require confirmed, stable values that *do
not* fluctuate on realtime bars. The
[section below](#avoiding-repainting) explains how to achieve such a result and avoid repainting
data requests.

### [Avoiding Repainting](https://www.tradingview.com#avoiding-repainting)

#### [Higher-timeframe data](https://www.tradingview.com#higher-timeframe-data)

When requesting values from a higher timeframe, they are subject to
repainting since realtime bars can contain *unconfirmed* information
from developing HTF bars, and the script may adjust the times that new
values come in on historical bars. To avoid repainting HTF data, one
must ensure that the function only returns confirmed values with
consistent timing on all bars, regardless of bar state.

The most reliable approach to achieve non-repainting results is to use
an `expression` argument that only references past bars (e.g.,
`close[1]`) while using
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
as the `lookahead` value.

Using
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
with non-offset HTF data requests is discouraged since it prompts
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to "look ahead" to the final values of an HTF bar, retrieving
confirmed values *before* they're actually available in the script's
history. However, if the values used in the `expression` are offset by
at least one bar, the "future" data the function retrieves is no
longer from the future. Instead, the data represents confirmed values
from established, *available* HTF bars. In other words, applying an
offset to the `expression` effectively prevents the requested data from
repainting when the script restarts its executions and eliminates
lookahead bias in the historical series.

The following example demonstrates a repainting HTF data request. The
script uses
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
without offset modifications or additional arguments to retrieve the
results of a
[ta.wma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.wma)
call from a higher timeframe. It also highlights the background to
indicate which bars were in a realtime state during its calculations.

As shown on the chart below, the
[plot](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
of the requested WMA only changes on historical bars when HTF bars
close, whereas it fluctuates on all realtime bars since the data
includes unconfirmed values from the higher timeframe:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Historical-and-realtime-behavior-Avoiding-repainting-Higher-timeframe-data-1.BaZM3HDu_2k78Ln.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Avoiding HTF repainting demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The multiplier applied to the chart's timeframe.
int tfMultiplier = input.int(10, "Timeframe multiplier", 1)
//@variable The number of bars in the moving average.
int length = input.int(5, "WMA smoothing length")

//@variable The valid timeframe string closest to `tfMultiplier` times larger than the chart timeframe.
string timeframe = timeframe.from_seconds(timeframe.in_seconds() * tfMultiplier)

//@variable The weighted MA of `close` prices over `length` bars on the `timeframe`.
//          This request repaints because it includes unconfirmed HTF data on realtime bars and it may offset the
//          times of its historical results.
float requestedWMA = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, ta.wma(close, length))

// Plot the requested series.
plot(requestedWMA, "HTF WMA", color.purple, 3)
// Highlight the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 70) : na, title = "Realtime bar highlight")
```

To avoid repainting in this script, we can add
`lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on` to the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call and offset the call history of
[ta.wma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.wma)
by one bar with the history-referencing operator
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D),
ensuring the request always retrieves the last confirmed HTF bar's WMA
at the start of each new `timeframe`. Unlike the previous script, this
version has consistent behavior on historical and realtime bar states,
as we see below:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Historical-and-realtime-behavior-Avoiding-repainting-Higher-timeframe-data-2.DgoLhl8Y_1sHSHG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Avoiding HTF repainting demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The multiplier applied to the chart's timeframe.
int tfMultiplier = input.int(10, "Timeframe multiplier", 1)
//@variable The number of bars in the moving average.
int length = input.int(5, "WMA smoothing length")

//@variable The valid timeframe string closest to `tfMultiplier` times larger than the chart timeframe.
string timeframe = timeframe.from_seconds(timeframe.in_seconds() * tfMultiplier)

//@variable The weighted MA of `close` prices over `length` bars on the `timeframe`.
//          This request does not repaint, as it always references the last confirmed WMA value on all bars.
float requestedWMA = request.security(
     syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, ta.wma(close, length)[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on
 )

// Plot the requested value.
plot(requestedWMA, "HTF WMA", color.purple, 3)
// Highlight the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 70) : na, title = "Realtime bar highlight")
```

#### [Lower-timeframe data](https://www.tradingview.com#lower-timeframe-data)

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
and
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
functions can retrieve data from lower-timeframe contexts. The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function can only retrieve data from a *single* intrabar in each chart
bar, and
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
retrieves data from *all* available intrabars.

When using these functions to retrieve intrabar data, it's important to
note that such requests are **not** immune to repainting behavior.
Historical and realtime series often rely on *separate* data feeds. Data
providers may retroactively modify realtime data, and it's possible for
races to occur in realtime data feeds, as explained in the
[Data feeds](#data-feeds) section of this page. Either case may result in intrabar
data retrieved on realtime bars repainting after the script restarts its
executions.

Additionally, a particular case that *will* cause repainting LTF
requests is using
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
with
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
to retrieve data from the first intrabar in each chart bar. While it
will generally work as expected on historical bars, it will track only
the most recent intrabar on realtime bars, as
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
does not retain all intrabar information, and the intrabars the function retrieves on realtime bars are unsorted until restarting the
script:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Historical-and-realtime-behavior-Avoiding-repainting-Lower-timeframe-data-1.CBTFrSjr_3y4ey.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Avoiding LTF repainting demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The lower timeframe of the requested data.
string lowerTimeframe = input.timeframe("1", "Timeframe")

//@variable The first intrabar `close` requested from the `lowerTimeframe` on each bar.
//          Only works as intended on historical bars.
float requestedClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, lowerTimeframe, close, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

// Plot the `requestedClose`.
plot(requestedClose, "First intrabar close", linewidth = 3)
// Highlight the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 60) : na, title = "Realtime bar Highlight")
```

One can mitigate this behavior and track the values from the first
intrabar, or any available intrabar in the chart bar, by using
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
since it maintains an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of intrabar values ordered by the times they come in. Here, we call
[array.first()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.first)
on a requested
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
of intrabar data to retrieve the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price from the first available intrabar in each chart bar:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Historical-and-realtime-behavior-Avoiding-repainting-Lower-timeframe-data-2.6WrbL0Kk_wVrfM.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Avoiding LTF repainting demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The lower timeframe of the requested data.
string lowerTimeframe = input.timeframe("1", "Timeframe")

//@variable An array of intrabar `close` values requested from the `lowerTimeframe` on each bar.
array<float> requestedCloses = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, lowerTimeframe, close)

//@variable The first intrabar `close` on each bar with available data.
float firstClose = requestedCloses.size() > 0 ? requestedCloses.first() : na

// Plot the `firstClose`.
plot(firstClose, "First intrabar close", linewidth = 3)
// Highlight the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 60) : na, title = "Realtime bar Highlight")
```

Note that:

- While
  [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
  is more optimized for handling historical and realtime
  intrabars, it's still possible in some cases for minor
  repainting to occur due to data differences from the provider,
  as outlined above.
- This code may not show intrabar data on all available chart
  bars, depending on how many intrabars each chart bar contains,
  as `request.*()` functions can retrieve up to 200,000 intrabars
  from an LTF context. The maximum number of requestable intrabars depends on the user's [plan](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/). See
  [this](#request-calls) section of the
  [Limitations](#limitations)
  page for more information.

## [`request.currency_rate()`](https://www.tradingview.com#requestcurrency_rate)

When a script needs to convert values expressed in one currency to
another, one can use
[request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate).
This function requests a *daily rate* for currency conversion
calculations based on currency pair or [spread](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502298/) data from the most popular exchanges, providing a simpler alternative
to fetching specific pairs or
[spreads](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502298/)
with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security).

While one can use
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to retrieve daily currency rates, its use case is more involved than
[request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate),
as one needs to supply a valid *ticker ID* for a currency pair or spread
to request the rate. Additionally, a historical offset and
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
are necessary to prevent the results from repainting, as explained in
[this section](#avoiding-repainting).

The
[request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate)
function, on the other hand, only requires *currency codes*. No ticker
ID is needed when requesting rates with this function, and it ensures
non-repainting results without requiring additional specification.

The function's signature is as follows:

```
request.currency_rate(from, to, ignore_invalid_currency) → series float
```

The `from` parameter specifies the currency to convert, and the `to`
parameter specifies the target currency. Both parameters accept
"string" values representing valid currency codes (e.g.,
"USD") or any built-in `currency.*` variable (e.g.,
[currency.USD](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_currency.USD)).

When the function cannot calculate a valid conversion rate between the specified
`from` and `to` currencies, programmers can decide whether
it raises a runtime error or returns
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) via
the `ignore_invalid_currency` parameter. The default value is `false`,
meaning the function raises a runtime error and halts the script's
executions.

The following example demonstrates a simple use case for
[request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate).
Suppose we want to convert values expressed in Turkish lira
([currency.TRY](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_currency.TRY))
to South Korean won
([currency.KRW](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_currency.KRW))
using a daily conversion rate. If we use
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
to retrieve the rate, we must supply a valid ticker ID and request the
last confirmed
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
from the previous day.

In this case, no valid symbol exists that would allow us to
retrieve a conversion rate directly with
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security).
Therefore, we first need a ticker ID for a
[spread](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502298/)
that converts TRY to an intermediate currency, such as USD, then
converts the intermediate currency to KRW. We can then use that ticker
ID within
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
with `close[1]` as the `expression` and
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
as the `lookahead` value to request a non-repainting daily rate.

Alternatively, we can achieve the same result more simply by calling
[request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate).
This function does all the heavy lifting for us, only requiring `from`
and `to` currency arguments to perform its calculation.

As we see below, both approaches return the same daily rate:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-currency-rate-1.C1rKgV4h_1dBAP1.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting currency rates demo")

//@variable The currency to convert.
simple string fromCurrency = currency.TRY
//@variable The resulting currency.
simple string toCurrency = currency.KRW

//@variable The spread symbol to request. Required in `request.security()` because no direct symbol exists.
simple string spreadSymbol = str.format("{0}{2} * {2}{1}", fromCurrency, toCurrency, currency.USD)

//@variable The non-repainting conversion rate from `request.security()` using the `spreadSymbol`.
float securityRequestedRate = request.security(spreadSymbol, "1D", close[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
//@variable The non-repainting conversion rate from `request.currency_rate()`.
float nonSecurityRequestedRate = request.currency_rate(fromCurrency, toCurrency)

// Plot the requested rates. We can multiply TRY values by these rates to convert them to KRW.
plot(securityRequestedRate, "`request.security()` value", color.purple, 5)
plot(nonSecurityRequestedRate, "`request.currency_rate()` value", color.yellow, 2)
```

## [`request.dividends()`, `request.splits()`, and `request.earnings()`](https://www.tradingview.com#requestdividends-requestsplits-and-requestearnings)

Analyzing a stock's earnings data and corporate actions provides
helpful insights into its underlying financial strength. Pine Script™
provides the ability to retrieve essential information about applicable
stocks via
[request.dividends()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.dividends),
[request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits),
and
[request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings).

These are the functions' signatures:

```
request.dividends(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float
request.splits(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float
request.earnings(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float
```

Each function has the same parameters in its signature, with the
exception of
[request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits),
which doesn't have a `currency` parameter.

Note that unlike the `symbol` parameter in other `request.*()`
functions, the `ticker` parameter in these functions only accepts an
*"Exchange:Symbol" pair*, such as "NASDAQ:AAPL". The built-in
[syminfo.ticker](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.ticker)
variable does not work with these functions since it does not contain
exchange information. Instead, one must use
[syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid)
for such cases.

The `field` parameter determines the data the function will retrieve.
Each of these functions accepts different built-in variables as the
`field` argument since each requests different information about a
stock:

- The
  [request.dividends()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.dividends)
  function retrieves current dividend information for a stock, i.e.,
  the amount per share the issuing company paid out to investors who
  purchased shares before the ex-dividend date. Passing the built-in
  [dividends.gross](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dividends.gross)
  or
  [dividends.net](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dividends.net)
  variables to the `field` parameter specifies whether the returned
  value represents dividends before or after factoring in expenses the
  company deducts from its payouts.
- The
  [request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits)
  function retrieves current split and reverse split information for a
  stock. A split occurs when a company increases its outstanding
  shares to promote liquidity. A reverse split occurs when a company
  consolidates its shares and offers them at a higher price to attract
  specific investors or maintain their listing on a market that has a
  minimum per-share price. Companies express their split information
  as *ratios*. For example, a 5:1 split means the company issued
  additional shares to its shareholders so that they have five times
  the number of shares they had before the split, and the raw price of
  each share becomes one-fifth of the previous price. Passing
  [splits.numerator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_splits.numerator)
  or
  [splits.denominator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_splits.denominator)
  to the `field` parameter of
  [request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits)
  determines whether it returns the numerator or denominator of the
  split ratio.
- The
  [request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings)
  function retrieves the earnings per share (EPS) information for a
  stock `ticker`'s issuing company. The EPS value is the ratio of a
  company's net income to the number of outstanding stock shares,
  which investors consider an indicator of the company's
  profitability. Passing
  [earnings.actual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_earnings.actual),
  [earnings.estimate](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_earnings.estimate),
  or
  [earnings.standardized](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_earnings.standardized)
  as the `field` argument in
  [request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings)
  respectively determines whether the function requests the actual,
  estimated, or standardized EPS value.

For a detailed explanation of the `gaps`, `lookahead`, and
`ignore_invalid_symbol` parameters of these functions, see the
[Common characteristics](#common-characteristics) section at the top of this page.

It's important to note that the values returned by these functions
reflect the data available as it comes in. This behavior differs from
financial data originating from a
[request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial)
call in that the underlying data from such calls becomes available
according to a company's fiscal reporting period.

Here, we've included an example that displays a handy
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
containing the most recent dividend, split, and EPS data. The script
calls the `request.*()` functions discussed in this section to retrieve
the data, then converts the values to "strings" with `str.*()`
functions and displays the results in the `infoTable` with
[table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell):

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-dividends-request-splits-and-request-earnings-1.DVVI7Tee_yVHYk.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Dividends, splits, and earnings demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The size of the table's text.
string tableSize = input.string(
     size.large, "Table size", [size.auto, size.tiny, size.small, size.normal, size.large, size.huge]
 )

//@variable The color of the table's text and frame.
var color tableColor = chart.fg_color
//@variable A `table` displaying the latest dividend, split, and EPS information.
var table infoTable = table.new(position.top_right, 3, 4, frame_color = tableColor, frame_width = 1)

// Add header cells on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    table.cell(infoTable, 0, 0, "Field", text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
    table.cell(infoTable, 1, 0, "Value", text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
    table.cell(infoTable, 2, 0, "Date", text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
    table.cell(infoTable, 0, 1, "Dividend", text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
    table.cell(infoTable, 0, 2, "Split", text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
    table.cell(infoTable, 0, 3, "EPS", text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)

//@variable The amount of the last reported dividend as of the current bar.
float latestDividend = request.dividends(syminfo.tickerid, dividends.gross, barmerge.gaps_on)
//@variable The numerator of that last reported split ratio as of the current bar.
float latestSplitNum = request.splits(syminfo.tickerid, splits.numerator, barmerge.gaps_on)
//@variable The denominator of the last reported split ratio as of the current bar.
float latestSplitDen = request.splits(syminfo.tickerid, splits.denominator, barmerge.gaps_on)
//@variable The last reported earnings per share as of the current bar.
float latestEPS = request.earnings(syminfo.tickerid, earnings.actual, barmerge.gaps_on)

// Update the "Value" and "Date" columns when new values come in.
if not na(latestDividend)
    table.cell(
         infoTable, 1, 1, str.tostring(math.round(latestDividend, 3)), text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize
     )
    table.cell(infoTable, 2, 1, str.format_time(time, "yyyy-MM-dd"), text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
if not na(latestSplitNum)
    table.cell(
         infoTable, 1, 2, str.format("{0}-for-{1}", latestSplitNum, latestSplitDen), text_color = tableColor,
         text_size = tableSize
     )
    table.cell(infoTable, 2, 2, str.format_time(time, "yyyy-MM-dd"), text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
if not na(latestEPS)
    table.cell(infoTable, 1, 3, str.tostring(latestEPS), text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
    table.cell(infoTable, 2, 3, str.format_time(time, "yyyy-MM-dd"), text_color = tableColor, text_size = tableSize)
```

Note that:

- We've included
  [barmerge.gaps_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.gaps_on)
  in the `request.*()` calls, so they only return values when new
  data is available. Otherwise, they return
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).
- The script assigns a
  [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
  ID to the `infoTable` variable on the first chart bar. On
  subsequent bars, it updates necessary cells with new information
  whenever data is available.
- If no information is available from any of the `request.*()`
  calls throughout the chart's history (e.g., if the `ticker` has
  no dividend information), the script does not initialize the
  corresponding cells since it's unnecessary.

## [`request.financial()`](https://www.tradingview.com#requestfinancial)

Financial metrics provide investors with insights about a company's
economic and financial health that are not tangible from solely
analyzing its stock prices. TradingView offers a wide variety of
financial metrics from [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) that traders
can access via the "Financials" tab in the "Indicators" menu of the
chart. Scripts can access available metrics for an instrument directly
via the
[request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial)
function.

This is the function's signature:

```
request.financial(symbol, financial_id, period, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float
```

As with the first parameter in
[request.dividends()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.dividends),
[request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits),
and
[request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings),
the `symbol` parameter in
[request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial)
requires an *"Exchange:Symbol" pair*. To request financial information
for the chart's ticker ID, use
[syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid),
as
[syminfo.ticker](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.ticker)
will not work.

The `financial_id` parameter accepts a "string" value representing
the ID of the requested financial metric. TradingView has numerous
financial metrics to choose from. See the
[Financial IDs](#financial-ids) section below for an overview of all accessible metrics and
their "string" identifiers.

The `period` parameter specifies the fiscal period for which new
requested data comes in. It accepts one of the following "string" arguments:
**"FQ" (quarterly), "FH" (semiannual), "FY" (annual), or "TTM"
(trailing twelve months)**. Not all fiscal periods are available for all
metrics or instruments. To confirm which periods are available for
specific metrics, see the second column of the tables in the
[Financial IDs](#financial-ids) section.

See this page's
[Common characteristics](#common-characteristics) section for a detailed explanation of this function's
`gaps`, `ignore_invalid_symbol`, and `currency` parameters.

It's important to note that the data retrieved from this function comes
in at a *fixed frequency*, independent of the precise date on which the
data is made available within a fiscal period. For a company's
dividends, splits, and earnings per share (EPS) information, one can
request data reported on exact dates via
[request.dividends()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.dividends),
[request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits),
and
[request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings).

This script uses
[request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial)
to retrieve information about the income and expenses of a stock's
issuing company and visualize the profitability of its typical business
operations. It requests the "OPER_INCOME", "TOTAL_REVENUE", and
"TOTAL_OPER_EXPENSE"
[financial IDs](#financial-ids) for the
[syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid)
over the latest `fiscalPeriod`, then
[plots](#plots) the results on the
chart:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-financial-1.B9cESm-h_ZhOVcV.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting financial data demo", format = format.volume)

//@variable The size of the fiscal reporting period. Some options may not be available, depending on the instrument.
string fiscalPeriod = input.string("FQ", "Period", ["FQ", "FH", "FY", "TTM"])

//@variable The operating income after expenses reported for the stock's issuing company.
float operatingIncome = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "OPER_INCOME", fiscalPeriod)
//@variable The total revenue reported for the stock's issuing company.
float totalRevenue = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "TOTAL_REVENUE", fiscalPeriod)
//@variable The total operating expenses reported for the stock's issuing company.
float totalExpenses = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "TOTAL_OPER_EXPENSE", fiscalPeriod)

//@variable Is aqua when the `totalRevenue` exceeds the `totalExpenses`, fuchsia otherwise.
color incomeColor = operatingIncome > 0 ? color.new(color.aqua, 50) : color.new(color.fuchsia, 50)

// Display the requested data.
plot(operatingIncome, "Operating income", incomeColor, 1, plot.style_area)
plot(totalRevenue, "Total revenue", color.green, 3)
plot(totalExpenses, "Total operating expenses", color.red, 3)
```

Note that:

- Not all `fiscalPeriod` options are available for every ticker
  ID. For example, companies in the US typically publish
  *quarterly* reports, whereas many European companies publish
  *semiannual* reports. See [this
  page](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000540147)
  in our Help Center for more information.

### [Calculating financial metrics](https://www.tradingview.com#calculating-financial-metrics)

The
[request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial)
function can provide scripts with numerous useful financial metrics that
don't require additional calculations. However, some commonly used
financial estimates require combining an instrument's current market
price with requested financial data. Such is the case for:

- Market Capitalization (market price * total shares outstanding)
- Earnings Yield (12-month EPS / market price)
- Price-to-Book Ratio (market price / BVPS)
- Price-to-Earnings Ratio (market price / EPS)
- Price-to-Sales Ratio (market cap / 12-month total revenue)

The following script contains
[user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) that calculate the above financial metrics for the
[syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.tickerid).
We've created these functions so users can easily copy them into their
scripts. This example uses them within a
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
call to construct a `tooltipText`, which it displays in tooltips on the
chart using [labels](#labels). Hovering over any bar's
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
will expose the tooltip containing the metrics calculated on that bar:

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-financial-Calculating-financial-metrics-1.BXp-EVdL_Z2nJnG7.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Calculating financial metrics demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@function Calculates the market capitalization (market cap) for the chart's symbol.
marketCap() =>
    //@variable The most recent number of outstanding shares reported for the symbol.
    float totalSharesOutstanding = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "TOTAL_SHARES_OUTSTANDING", "FQ")
    // Return the market cap value.
    totalSharesOutstanding * close

//@function Calculates the Earnings Yield for the chart's symbol.
earningsYield() =>
    //@variable The most recent 12-month earnings per share reported for the symbol.
    float eps = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "EARNINGS_PER_SHARE", "TTM")
    //Return the Earnings Yield percentage.
    100.0 * eps / close

//@function Calculates the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio for the chart's symbol.
priceBookRatio() =>
    //@variable The most recent Book Value Per Share (BVPS) reported for the symbol.
    float bookValuePerShare = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "BOOK_VALUE_PER_SHARE", "FQ")
    // Return the P/B ratio.
    close / bookValuePerShare

//@function Calculates the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio for the chart's symbol.
priceEarningsRatio() =>
    //@variable The most recent 12-month earnings per share reported for the symbol.
    float eps = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "EARNINGS_PER_SHARE", "TTM")
    // Return the P/E ratio.
    close / eps

//@function Calculates the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio for the chart's symbol.
priceSalesRatio() =>
    //@variable The most recent number of outstanding shares reported for the symbol.
    float totalSharesOutstanding = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "TOTAL_SHARES_OUTSTANDING", "FQ")
    //@variable The most recent 12-month total revenue reported for the symbol.
    float totalRevenue = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "TOTAL_REVENUE", "TTM")
    // Return the P/S ratio.
    totalSharesOutstanding * close / totalRevenue

//@variable The text to display in label tooltips.
string tooltipText = str.format(
     "Market Cap: {0} {1}\nEarnings Yield: {2}%\nP/B Ratio: {3}\nP/E Ratio: {4}\nP/S Ratio: {5}",
     str.tostring(marketCap(), format.volume), syminfo.currency, earningsYield(), priceBookRatio(),
     priceEarningsRatio(), priceSalesRatio()
 )

//@variable Displays a blank label with a tooltip containing the `tooltipText`.
label info = label.new(chart.point.now(high), tooltip = tooltipText)
```

Note that:

- Since not all companies publish quarterly financial reports, one
  may need to change the "FQ" in these functions to match the
  minimum reporting period for a specific company, as the
  [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial)
  calls will return
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  when "FQ" data isn't available.

### [Financial IDs](https://www.tradingview.com#financial-ids)

Below is an overview of all financial metrics one can request via
[request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial),
along with the periods in which reports may be available. We've divided
this information into four tables corresponding to the categories
displayed in the "Financials" section of the "Indicators" menu:

- [Income statements](#income-statements)
- [Balance sheet](#balance-sheet)
- [Cash flow](#cash-flow)
- [Statistics](#statistics)

Each table has the following three columns:

- The first column contains descriptions of each metric with links to
  Help Center pages for additional information.
- The second column lists the possible `period` arguments allowed for
  the metric. Note that all available values may not be compatible
  with specific ticker IDs, e.g., while "FQ" may be a possible
  argument, it will not work if the issuing company does not publish
  quarterly data.
- The third column lists the "string" IDs for the `financial_id`
  argument in
  [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial).

#### [Income statements](https://www.tradingview.com#income-statements)

The
[request.economic()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.economic)
function provides scripts with the ability to retrieve economic data for
a specified country or region, including information about the state of
the economy (GDP, inflation rate, etc.) or of a particular industry
(steel production, ICU beds, etc.).

Below is the signature for this function:

```
request.economic(country_code, field, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float
```

The `country_code` parameter accepts a "string" value representing
the identifier of the country or region to request economic data for
(e.g., "US", "EU", etc.). See the
[Country/region codes](#countryregion-codes) section for a complete list of codes this function supports.
Note that the economic metrics available depend on the country or region
specified in the function call.

The `field` parameter accepts a "string" specifying the metric that the function requests.
The
[Field codes](#field-codes) section covers all accessible metrics and the
countries/regions they're available for.

For a detailed explanation on the last two parameters of this function,
see the
[Common characteristics](#common-characteristics) section at the top of this page.

This simple example requests the growth rate of the Gross Domestic
Product ("GDPQQ") for the United States ("US") using
[request.economic()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.economic),
then [plots](#plots) its value on the
chart with a [gradient
color](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.from_gradient):

![image](images/Other-timeframes-and-data-Request-economic-1.B5XiS4A4_2mUcAV.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requesting economic data demo")

//@variable The GDP growth rate for the US economy.
float gdpqq = request.economic("US", "GDPQQ")

//@variable The all-time maximum growth rate.
float maxRate = ta.max(gdpqq)
//@variable The all-time minimum growth rate.
float minRate = ta.min(gdpqq)

//@variable The color of the `gdpqq` plot.
color rateColor = switch
    gdpqq >= 0 => color.from_gradient(gdpqq, 0, maxRate, color.purple, color.blue)
    =>            color.from_gradient(gdpqq, minRate, 0, color.red, color.purple)

// Plot the results.
plot(gdpqq, "US GDP Growth Rate", rateColor, style = plot.style_area)
```

Note that:

- This example does not include a `gaps` argument in the
  [request.economic()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.economic)
  call, so the function uses the default
  [barmerge.gaps_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.gaps_off).
  In other words, it returns the last retrieved value when new
  data isn't yet available.

### [Country/region codes](https://www.tradingview.com#countryregion-codes)

The table in this section lists all country/region codes available for
use with
[request.economic()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.economic).
The first column of the table contains the "string" values that
represent the country or region code, and the second column contains the
corresponding country/region names.

It's important to note that the value used as the `country_code`
argument determines which
[field codes](#field-codes) are accessible to the function.

[`request.seed()`](https://www.tradingview.com#requestseed)

TradingView aggregates a vast amount of data from its many providers, including price and volume information on tradable instruments, financials, economic data, and more, which users can retrieve in Pine Script™ using the functions discussed in the sections above, as well as multiple built-in variables.

To further expand the horizons of possible data one can analyze on TradingView, we have [Pine Seeds](https://github.com/tradingview-pine-seeds/docs), which allows users to supply custom *user-maintained* EOD data feeds via GitHub for use on TradingView charts and within Pine Script™ code.

To retrieve data from a Pine Seeds data feed within a script, use the [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.seed) function. Below is the function's signature:

```
request.seed(source, symbol, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, calc_bars_count) → series <type>
```

The `source` parameter specifies the unique name of the user-maintained GitHub repository that contains the data feed.

The `symbol` parameter represents the file name from the "data/" directory of the `source` repository, excluding the ".csv" file extension. See [this page](https://github.com/tradingview-pine-seeds/docs/blob/main/data.md) for information about the structure of the data stored in repositories.

The `expression` parameter is the series to evaluate using data extracted from the requested context. It is similar to the equivalent in [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) and [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf). Data feeds stored in user-maintained repos contain [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time), [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low), [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close), and [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) information, meaning the `expression` argument can use the corresponding built-in variables, including variables derived from them (e.g., [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index), [ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4), etc.) to request their values from the context of the custom data.

The script below visualizes sample data from the [seed_crypto_santiment](https://github.com/tradingview-pine-seeds/seed_crypto_santiment) demo repository. It uses two calls to [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.seed) to retrieve the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) values from the repository's [BTC_SENTIMENT_POSITIVE_TOTAL](https://github.com/tradingview-pine-seeds/seed_crypto_santiment/blob/master/data/BTC_SENTIMENT_POSITIVE_TOTAL.csv) and [BTC_SENTIMENT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL](https://github.com/tradingview-pine-seeds/seed_crypto_santiment/blob/master/data/BTC_SENTIMENT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL.csv) data feeds and [plots](#plots) the results on the chart as [step lines](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_plot.style_stepline):

// Plot the data.
plot(positiveTotal, "Positive sentiment", color.teal, 2, plot.style_stepline)

```

Note that:

- This example requests data from the repository highlighted in the [Pine Seeds documentation](https://github.com/tradingview-pine-seeds/docs/blob/main/README.md). It exists solely for example purposes, and its data *does not* update on a regular basis.
- Unlike most other `request.*()` functions, [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.seed) does not have a `gaps` parameter. It always returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values when no new data exists.
- Pine Seeds data is searchable from the chart's symbol search bar. To load a data feed on the chart, enter the *"Repo:File" pair*, similar to searching for an "Exchange:Symbol" pair.

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

The
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
function is the most frequently used function used to display
information calculated using Pine scripts. It is versatile and can plot
different styles of lines, histograms, areas, columns (like volume
columns), fills, circles or crosses.

The use of
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
to create fills is explained in the page on
[Fills](#fills).

This script showcases a few different uses of
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
in an overlay script:

![image](images/Plots-Introduction-01.Ctk4DlIO_24M1qs.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`plot()`", "", true)
plot(high, "Blue `high` line")
plot(math.avg(close, open), "Crosses in body center", close > open ? color.lime : color.purple, 6, plot.style_cross)
plot(math.min(open, close), "Navy step line on body low point", color.navy, 3, plot.style_stepline)
plot(low, "Gray dot on `low`", color.gray, 3, plot.style_circles)

color VIOLET = #AA00FF
color GOLD   = #CCCC00
ma = ta.alma(hl2, 40, 0.85, 6)
var almaColor = color.silver
almaColor := ma > ma[2] ? GOLD : ma < ma[2]  ? VIOLET : almaColor
plot(ma, "Two-color ALMA", almaColor, 2)
```

Note that:

- The first
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  call plots a 1-pixel blue line across the bar highs.
- The second plots crosses at the mid-point of bodies. The crosses are
  colored lime when the bar is up and purple when it is down. The
  argument used for `linewidth` is `6` but it is not a pixel value;
  just a relative size.
- The third call plots a 3-pixel wide step line following the low
  point of bodies.
- The fourth call plot a gray circle at the bars'
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low).
- The last plot requires some preparation. We first define our
  bull/bear colors, calculate an [Arnaud Legoux Moving
  Average](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000594683),
  then make our color calculations. We initialize our color variable
  on bar zero only, using
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var).
  We initialize it to
  [color.silver](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_color%7Bdot%7Dsilver),
  so on the dataset's first bars, until one of our conditions causes
  the color to change, the line will be silver. The conditions that
  change the color of the line require it to be higher/lower than its
  value two bars ago. This makes for less noisy color transitions than
  if we merely looked for a higher/lower value than the previous one.

This script shows other uses of
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
in a pane:

![image](images/Plots-Introduction-02.CEeiodqC_Z1WHdqJ.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Volume change", format = format.volume)

color GREEN         = #008000
color GREEN_LIGHT   = color.new(GREEN, 50)
color GREEN_LIGHTER = color.new(GREEN, 85)
color PINK          = #FF0080
color PINK_LIGHT    = color.new(PINK, 50)
color PINK_LIGHTER  = color.new(PINK, 90)

bool  barUp = ta.rising(close, 1)
bool  barDn = ta.falling(close, 1)
float volumeChange = ta.change(volume)

volumeColor = barUp ? GREEN_LIGHTER : barDn ? PINK_LIGHTER : color.gray
plot(volume, "Volume columns", volumeColor, style = plot.style_columns)

volumeChangeColor = barUp ? volumeChange > 0 ? GREEN : GREEN_LIGHT : volumeChange > 0 ? PINK : PINK_LIGHT
plot(volumeChange, "Volume change columns", volumeChangeColor, 12, plot.style_histogram)

plot(0, "Zero line", color.gray)
```

Note that:

- We are plotting normal
  [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
  values as wide columns above the zero line (see the
  `style = plot.style_columns` in our
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  call).
- Before plotting the columns we calculate our `volumeColor` by using
  the values of the `barUp` and `barDn` boolean variables. They become
  respectively `true` when the current bar's
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  is higher/lower than the previous one. Note that the "Volume"
  built-in does not use the same condition; it identifies an up bar
  with `close > open`. We use the `GREEN_LIGHTER` and `PINK_LIGHTER`
  colors for the volume columns.
- Because the first plot plots columns, we do not use the `linewidth`
  parameter, as it has no effect on columns.
- Our script's second plot is the **change** in volume, which we have
  calculated earlier using `ta.change(volume)`. This value is plotted
  as a histogram, for which the `linewidth` parameter controls the
  width of the column. We make this width `12` so that histogram
  elements are thinner than the columns of the first plot.
  Positive/negative `volumeChange` values plot above/below the zero
  line; no manipulation is required to achieve this effect.
- Before plotting the histogram of `volumeChange` values, we calculate
  its color value, which can be one of four different colors. We use
  the bright `GREEN` or `PINK` colors when the bar is up/down AND the
  volume has increased since the last bar (`volumeChange > 0`).
  Because `volumeChange` is positive in this case, the histogram's
  element will be plotted above the zero line. We use the bright
  `GREEN_LIGHT` or `PINK_LIGHT` colors when the bar is up/down AND the
  volume has NOT increased since the last bar. Because `volumeChange`
  is negative in this case, the histogram's element will be plotted
  below the zero line.
- Finally, we plot a zero line. We could just as well have used
  `hline(0)` there.
- We use `format = format.volume` in our
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  call so that large values displayed for this script are abbreviated
  like those of the built-in "Volume" indicator.

[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
calls must always be placed in a line's first position, which entails
they are always in the script's global scope. They can't be placed in
user-defined functions or structures like
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if),
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for),
etc. Calls to
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)**can**, however, be designed to plot conditionally in two ways, which
we cover in the
[Plotting conditionally](#plotting-conditionally) section of this page.

A script can only plot in its own visual space, whether it is in a pane
or on the chart as an overlay. Scripts running in a pane can only
[color bars](#bar-coloring) in the
chart area.

## [`plot()` parameters](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-parameters)

The
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
function has the following signature:

```
plot(series, title, color, linewidth, style, trackprice, histbase, offset, join, editable, show_last, display, force_overlay) → plot
```

The parameters of
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
are:

`series`

It is the only mandatory parameter. Its argument must be of "series
int/float" type. Note that because the auto-casting rules in Pine
Script™ convert in the int 🠆 float 🠆 bool direction, a "bool" type
variable cannot be used as is; it must be converted to an "int" or
a "float" for use as an argument. For example, if `newDay` is of
"bool" type, then `newDay ? 1 : 0` can be used to plot 1 when the
variable is `true`, and zero when it is `false`.

`title`

Requires a "const string" argument, so it must be known at compile
time. The string appears:

- In the script's scale when the "Chart
  settings/Scales/Indicator Name Label" field is checked.
- In the Data Window.
- In the "Settings/Style" tab.
- In the dropdown of
  [input.source()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsource)
  fields.
- In the "Condition" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box,
  when the script is selected.
- As the column header when exporting chart data to a CSV file.

`color`

Accepts "series color", so can be calculated on the fly, bar by
bar. Plotting with
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
as the color, or any color with a transparency of 100, is one way to
hide plots when they are not needed.

`linewidth`

Is the plotted element's size, but it does not apply to all styles.
When a line is plotted, the unit is pixels. It has no impact when
[plot.style_columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_columns)
is used.

`style`

The available arguments are:

- [plot.style_line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_line)
  (the default): It plots a continous line using the `linewidth`
  argument in pixels for its width.
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values will not plot as a line, but they will be bridged when a
  value that is not
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  comes in.
  Non-[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values are only bridged if they are visible on the chart.
- [plot.style_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_linebr):
  Allows the plotting of discontinuous lines by not plotting on
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values, and not joining gaps, i.e., bridging over
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values.
- [plot.style_stepline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_stepline):
  Plots using a staircase effect. Transitions between changes in
  values are done using a vertical line drawn in middle of bars,
  as opposed to a point-to-point diagonal joining the midpoints of
  bars. Can also be used to achieve an effect similar to that of
  [plot.style_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_linebr),
  but only if care is taken to plot no color on
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values.
- [plot.style_area](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_area):
  plots a line of `linewidth` width, filling the area between the
  line and the `histbase`. The `color` argument is used for both
  the line and the fill. You can make the line a different color
  by using another
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  call. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative
  values below it.
- [plot.style_areabr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_area):
  This is similar to
  [plot.style_area](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_area)
  but it doesn't bridge over
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values. Another difference is how the indicator's scale is
  calculated. Only the plotted values serve in the calculation of
  the *y* range of the script's visual space. If only high values
  situated far away from the `histbase` are plotted, for example,
  those values will be used to calculate the *y* scale of the
  script's visual space. Positive values are plotted above the
  `histbase`, negative values below it.
- [plot.style_columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_columns):
  Plots columns similar to those of the "Volume" built-in
  indicator. The `linewidth` value does **not** affect the width
  of the columns. Positive values are plotted above the
  `histbase`, negative values below it. Always includes the value
  of `histbase` in the *y* scale of the script's visual space.
- [plot.style_histogram](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_histogram):
  Plots columns similar to those of the "Volume" built-in
  indicator, except that the `linewidth` value is used to
  determine the width of the histogram's bars in pixels. Note
  that since `linewidth` requires an "input int" value, the
  width of the histogram's bars cannot vary bar to bar. Positive
  values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below
  it. Always includes the value of `histbase` in the *y* scale of
  the script's visual space.
- [plot.style_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_circles)
  and
  [plot.style_cross](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_cross):
  These plot a shape that is not joined across bars unless
  `join = true` is also used. For these styles, the `linewidth`
  argument becomes a relative sizing measure — its units are not
  pixels.

`trackprice`

The default value of this is `false`. When it is `true`, a dotted
line made up of small squares will be plotted the full width of the
script's visual space. It is often used in conjuction with
`show_last = 1, offset = -99999` to hide the actual plot and only
leave the residual dotted line.

`histbase`

It is the reference point used with
[plot.style_area](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_area),
[plot.style_columns](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_columns)
and
[plot.style_histogram](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_histogram).
It determines the level separating positive and negative values of
the `series` argument. It cannot be calculated dynamically, as an
"input int/float" is required.

`offset`

This allows shifting the plot in the past/future using a
negative/positive offset in bars. The value cannot change during the
script's execution.

`join`

This only affect styles
[plot.style_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_circles)
or
[plot.style_cross](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_cross).
When `true`, the shapes are joined by a one-pixel line.

`editable`

This boolean parameter controls whether or not the plot's
properties can be edited in the "Settings/Style" tab. Its default
value is `true`.

`show_last`

Allows control over how many of the last bars the plotted values are
visible. An "input int" argument is required, so it cannot be
calculated dynamically.

`display`

The default is
[display.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_display%7Bdot%7Dall).
When it is set to
[display.none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_display%7Bdot%7Dnone),
plotted values will not affect the scale of the script's visual
space. The plot will be invisible and will not appear in indicator
values or the Data Window. It can be useful in plots destined for
use as external inputs for other scripts, or for plots used with the
`{{plot("[plot_title]")}}` placeholder in
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
calls, e.g.:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
r = ta.rsi(close, 14)
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
plot(r, "RSI", display = display.none)
alertcondition(xUp, "xUp alert", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot("RSI")}}')
```

`force_overlay`

If `true`, the plotted results will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is `false`.

## [Plotting conditionally](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting-conditionally)

[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
calls cannot be used in conditional structures such as
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if), but
they can be controlled by varying their plotted values, or their color.
When no plot is required, you can either plot
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values, or plot values using
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) color
or any color with 100 transparency (which also makes it invisible).

### [Value control](https://www.tradingview.com#value-control)

One way to control the display of plots is to plot
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values when no plot is needed. Sometimes, values returned by functions
such as
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
will return
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values, when `gaps = barmerge.gaps_on` is used, for example. In both
these cases it is sometimes useful to plot discontinuous lines. This
script shows a few ways to do it:

![image](images/Plots-PlottingConditionally-01.DCGRnCbX_1NjoOk.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Discontinuous plots", "", true)
bool plotValues = bar_index % 3 == 0
plot(plotValues ? high : na, color = color.fuchsia, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(plotValues ? high : na)
plot(plotValues ? math.max(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_cross)
plot(plotValues ? math.min(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(plotValues ? low : na, color = plotValues ? color.green : na, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_stepline)
```

Note that:

- We define the condition determining when we plot using
  `bar_index % 3 == 0`, which becomes `true` when the remainder of the
  division of the bar index by 3 is zero. This will happen every three
  bars.
- In the first plot, we use
  [plot.style_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_linebr),
  which plots the fuchsia line on highs. It is centered on the bar's
  horizontal midpoint.
- The second plot shows the result of plotting the same values, but
  without using special care to break the line. What's happening here
  is that the thin blue line of the plain
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  call is automatically bridged over
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values (or *gaps*), so the plot does not interrupt.
- We then plot navy blue crosses and circles on the body tops and
  bottoms. The
  [plot.style_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_circles)
  and
  [plot.style_cross](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_cross)
  style are a simple way to plot discontinuous values, e.g., for stop
  or take profit levels, or support & resistance levels.
- The last plot in green on the bar lows is done using
  [plot.style_stepline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_stepline).
  Note how its segments are wider than the fuchsia line segments
  plotted with
  [plot.style_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_linebr).
  Also note how on the last bar, it only plots halfway until the next
  bar comes in.
- The plotting order of each plot is controlled by their order of
  appearance in the script. See

This script shows how you can restrict plotting to bars after a
user-defined date. We use the
[input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dtime)
function to create an input widget allowing script users to select a
date and time, using Jan 1st 2021 as its default value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
startInput = input.time(timestamp("2021-01-01"))
plot(time > startInput ? close : na)
```

### [Color control](https://www.tradingview.com#color-control)

The
[Conditional coloring](#conditional-coloring) section of the page on colors discusses color control for
plots. We'll look here at a few examples.

The value of the `color` parameter in
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
can be a constant, such as one of the built-in
[constant colors](#constant-colors) or a
[color literal](#color). In Pine Script™, the qualified type of such colors is
called **"const color"** (see the
[Type system](#type-system) page). They
are known at compile time:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plot(close, color = color.gray)
```

The color of a plot can also be determined using information that is
only known when the script begins execution on the first historical bar
of a chart (bar zero, i.e., `bar_index == 0` or
`barstate.isfirst == true`), as will be the case when the information
needed to determine a color depends on the chart the script is running
on. Here, we calculate a plot color using the
[syminfo.type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dtype)
built-in variable, which returns the type of the chart's symbol. The
qualified type of `plotColor` in this case will be **"simple color"**:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plotColor = switch syminfo.type
    "stock"     => color.purple
    "futures"   => color.red
    "index"     => color.gray
    "forex"     => color.fuchsia
    "crypto"    => color.lime
    "fund"      => color.orange
    "dr"        => color.aqua
    "cfd"       => color.blue
plot(close, color = plotColor)
printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
printTable(syminfo.type)
```

Plot colors can also be chosen through a script's inputs. In this case,
the `lineColorInput` variable is of the **"input color"** type:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
color lineColorInput  = input(#1848CC, "Line color")
plot(close, color = lineColorInput)
```

Finally, plot colors can also be *dynamic* values, i.e., calculated
values that can change on each bar. These values are of the **"series
color"** type:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plotColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
plot(close, color = plotColor)
```

When plotting pivot levels, one common requirement is to avoid plotting
level transitions. Using [lines](#lines-and-boxes) is one alternative, but you can also use
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
like this:

![image](images/Plots-PlottingConditionally-02.Dgz5RTVC_Z2npVgz.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Pivot plots", "", true)
pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))
plot(pivotHigh, "High pivot", ta.change(pivotHigh) != 0 ? na : color.olive, 3)
plotchar(ta.change(pivotHigh), "ta.change(pivotHigh)", "•", location.top, size = size.small)
```

Note that:

- We use `pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))` to hold our pivot
  values. Because
  [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivothigh)
  only returns a value when a new pivot is found, we use
  [fixnan()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fixnan)
  to fill the gaps with the last pivot value returned. The gaps here
  refer to the
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values
  [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivothigh)
  returns when no new pivot is found.
- Our pivots are detected three bars after they occur because we use
  the argument `3` for both the `leftbars` and `rightbars` parameters
  in our
  [ta.pivothigh()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivothigh)
  call.
- The last plot is plotting a continuous value, but it is setting the
  plot's color to
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  when the pivot's value changes, so the plot isn't visible then.
  Because of this, a visible plot will only appear on the bar
  following the one where we plotted using
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  color.
- The blue dot indicates when a new high pivot is detected and no plot
  is drawn between the preceding bar and that one. Note how the pivot
  on the bar indicated by the arrow has just been detected in the
  realtime bar, three bars later, and how no plot is drawn. The plot
  will only appear on the next bar, making the plot visible **four
  bars** after the actual pivot.

## [Levels](https://www.tradingview.com#levels)

Pine Script™ has an
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
function to plot horizontal lines (see the page on
[Levels](#levels)).
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
is useful because it has some line styles unavailable with
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot),
but it also has some limitations, namely that it does not accept
"series color", and that its `price` parameter requires an "input
int/float", so cannot vary during the script's execution.

You can plot levels with
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
in a few different ways. This shows a
[CCI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502001)
indicator with levels plotted using
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot):

![image](images/Plots-Levels-01.jio4KIpw_Z2s6Io2.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("CCI levels with `plot()`")
plot(ta.cci(close, 20))
plot(0,  "Zero", color.gray, 1, plot.style_circles)
plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ?  100 : na,  "100", color.lime, 1, plot.style_linebr)
plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ? -100 : na, "-100", color.fuchsia, 1, plot.style_linebr)
plot( 200,  "200", color.green, 2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
plot(-200, "-200", color.red,   2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
plot( 300,  "300", color.new(color.green, 50), 1)
plot(-300, "-300", color.new(color.red, 50),   1)
```

Note that:

- The zero level is plotted using
  [plot.style_circles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_circles).
- The 100 levels are plotted using a conditional value that only plots
  every second bar. In order to prevent the
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values from being bridged, we use the
  [plot.style_linebr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot%7Bdot%7Dstyle_linebr)
  line style.
- The 200 levels are plotted using `trackprice = true` to plot a
  distinct pattern of small squares that extends the full width of the
  script's visual space. The `show_last = 1` in there displays only
  the last plotted value, which would appear as a one-bar straight
  line if the next trick wasn't also used: the `offset = -99999`
  pushes that one-bar segment far away in the past so that it is never
  visible.
- The 300 levels are plotted using a continuous line, but a lighter
  transparency is used to make them less prominent.

## [Offsets](https://www.tradingview.com#offsets)

The `offset` parameter specifies the shift used when the line is plotted
(negative values shift in the past, positive values shift into the
future). For example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plot(close, color = color.red, offset = -5)
plot(close, color = color.lime, offset = 5)
```

![image](images/Plots-Offsets-01.CBzf5b6H_1aubfP.png)

As can be seen in the screenshot, the *red* series has been shifted to
the left (since the argument's value is negative), while the *green*
series has been shifted to the right (its value is positive).

## [Plot count limit](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-count-limit)

Each script is limited to a maximum plot count of 64. All `plot*()`
calls and
[alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#func_alertcondition)
calls count in the plot count of a script. Some types of calls count for
more than one in the total plot count.

[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
calls count for one in the total plot count if they use a "const
color" argument for the `color` parameter, which means it is known at
compile time, e.g.:

```
plot(close, color = color.green)
```

When they use another qualified type, such as any one of these, they
will count for two in the total plot count:

```
plot(close, color = syminfo.mintick > 0.0001 ? color.green : color.red) //🠆 "simple color"
plot(close, color = input.color(color.purple)) //🠆 "input color"
plot(close, color = close > open ? color.green : color.red) //🠆 "series color"
plot(close, color = color.new(color.silver, close > open ? 40 : 0)) //🠆 "series color"
```

## [Scale](https://www.tradingview.com#scale)

Not all values can be plotted everywhere. Your script's visual space is
always bound by upper and lower limits that are dynamically adjusted
with the values plotted. An
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338)
indicator will plot values between 0 and 100, which is why it is usually
displayed in a distinct *pane* — or area — above or below the chart.
If RSI values were plotted as an overlay on the chart, the effect would
be to distort the symbol's normal price scale, unless it just hapenned
to be close to RSI's 0 to 100 range. This shows an RSI signal line and
a centerline at the 50 level, with the script running in a separate
pane:

![image](images/Plots-Scale-01.CE6dQl_T_1UEEw.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("RSI")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red,   0), color.new(color.red, 70))
myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
hline(50)
```

Note that the *y* axis of our script's visual space is automatically
sized using the range of values plotted, i.e., the values of RSI. See
the page on [Colors](#colors) for more
information on the
[color.from_gradient()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dfrom_gradient)
function used in the script.

If we try to plot the symbol's
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
values in the same space by adding the following line to our script:

```
plot(close)
```

This is what happens:

![image](images/Plots-Scale-02.D8wP6yEJ_Z1txJ3M.png)

The chart is on the BTCUSD symbol, whose
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
prices are around 40000 during this period. Plotting values in the 40000
range makes our RSI plots in the 0 to 100 range indiscernible. The same
distorted plots would occur if we placed the
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338)
indicator on the chart as an overlay.

### [Merging two indicators](https://www.tradingview.com#merging-two-indicators)

If you are planning to merge two signals in one script, first consider
the scale of each. It is impossible, for example, to correctly plot an
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338) and a
[MACD](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502344) in the
same script's visual space because RSI has a fixed range (0 to 100)
while MACD doesn't, as it plots moving averages calculated on price._

If both your indicators used fixed ranges, you can shift the values of
one of them so they do not overlap. We could, for example, plot both
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338) (0 to
100) and the [True Strength Indicator
(TSI)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592290) (-100
to +100) by displacing one of them. Our strategy here will be to
compress and shift the
[TSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592290) values
so they plot over
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338):

![image](images/Plots-Scale-03.D9mEXIxt_ZtI6jd.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("RSI and TSI")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red,   0), color.new(color.red, 70))
myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
hline(100)
hline(50)
hline(0)

// 1. Compress TSI's range from -100/100 to -50/50.
// 2. Shift it higher by 150, so its -50 min value becomes 100.
myTSI = 150 + (100 * ta.tsi(close, 13, 25) / 2)
plot(myTSI, "TSI", color.blue, 2)
plot(ta.ema(myTSI, 13), "TSI EMA", #FF006E)
hline(200)
hline(150)
```

Note that:

- We have added levels using
  [hline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
  to situate both signals.
- In order for both signal lines to oscillate on the same range of
  100, we divide the
  [TSI](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592290)
  value by 2 because it has a 200 range (-100 to +100). We then shift
  this value up by 150 so it oscillates between 100 and 200, making
  150 its centerline.
- The manipulations we make here are typical of the compromises
  required to bring two indicators with different scales in the same
  visual space, even when their values, contrary to
  [MACD](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502344),
  are bounded in a fixed range.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Repainting

# [Repainting](https://www.tradingview.com#repainting)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

We define repainting as: **script behavior causing historical vs
realtime calculations or plots to behave differently**.

Repainting behavior is widespread and many factors can cause it.
Following our definition, our estimate is that more than 95% of
indicators in existence exhibit some form of repainting behavior.
Commony used indicators such as MACD and RSI, for example, show
confirmed values on historical bars, but will fluctuate on a realtime,
unconfirmed chart bar until it closes. Therefore, they behave
*differently* in historical and realtime states.

**Not all repainting behavior is inherently useless or misleading**, nor
does such behavior prevent knowledgeable traders from using indicators
with such behavior. For example, who would think of discrediting a
volume profile indicator solely because it updates its values on
realtime bars?

One may encounter any of the following forms of repainting in the
scripts they use, depending on what a script's calculations entail:

- **Widespread but often acceptable**: A script may use values that
  update with realtime price changes on the unconfirmed bar. For
  example, if one uses the
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  variable in calculations performed on an open chart bar, its values
  will reflect the most recent price in the bar. However, the script
  will only commit a new data point to its historical series once the
  bar closes. Another common case is using
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  to fetch higher-timeframe data on realtime bars, as explained in the
  [Historical and realtime behavior](#historical-and-realtime-behavior) section of the
  [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page. As with the unconfirmed chart bar in the chart's
  timeframe,
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  can track unconfirmed values from a higher-timeframe context on
  realtime bars, which can lead to repainting after the script
  restarts its execution. There is often nothing wrong with using such
  scripts, provided you understand how they work. When electing to use
  such scripts to issue alerts or trade orders, however, it's
  important to understand the difference between their realtime and
  historical behavior and decide for yourself whether it provides
  utility for your needs.
- **Potentially misleading**: Scripts that plot values into the past,
  calculate results on realtime bars that one cannot replicate on
  historical bars, or relocate past events are potentially misleading.
  For example, Ichimoku, most scripts based on pivots, most strategies
  using `calc_on_every_tick = true`, scripts using
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  when it behaves differently on realtime bars, many scripts using
  [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip),
  many scripts using
  [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow),
  and some scripts that use `barstate.*` variables can exhibit
  misleading repainting behavior.
- **Unacceptable**: Scripts that leak future information into the
  past, strategies that execute on
  [non-standard charts](#non-standard-charts-data), and scripts using realtime intrabars to generate alerts
  or orders, are examples that can produce heavily misleading
  repainting behavior.
- **Unavoidable**: Revisions of the data feed from a provider and
  variations in the starting bar of the chart's history can cause
  repainting behavior that may be unavoidable in a script.

The first two types of repainting can be perfectly acceptable if:

1. You are aware of the behavior.
2. You can live with it, or
3. You can circumvent it.

It should now be clear that not **all** repainting behavior is wrong and
requires avoiding at all costs. In many situations, some forms of
repainting may be exactly what a script needs. What's important is to
know when repainting behavior is **not** acceptable for one's needs. To
avoid repainting that's not acceptable, it's important to understand
how a tool works or how you should design the tools you build. If you
[publish](#publishing) scripts, ensure
you mention any potentially misleading behavior along with the other
limitations of your script in the publication's description.

### [For script users](https://www.tradingview.com#for-script-users)

One can decide to use repainting indicators if they understand the
behavior, and whether that behavior meets their analysis requirements.
Don't be one of those newcomers who slap "repaint" sentences on
published scripts in an attempt to discredit them, as doing so reveals a
lack of foundational knowledge on the subject.

Simply asking whether a script repaints is relatively meaningless, given
that there are forms of repainting behavior that are perfectly
acceptable in a script. Therefore, such a question will not beget a
meaningful answer. One should instead ask *specific* questions about a
script's potential repainting behavior, such as:

- Does the script calculate/display in the same way on historical and
  realtime bars?
- Do alerts from the script wait for the end of a realtime bar before
  triggering?
- Do signal markers shown by the script wait for the end of a realtime
  bar before showing?
- Does the script plot/draw values into the past?
- Does the strategy use `calc_on_every_tick = true`?
- Do the script's
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  calls leak future information into the past on historical bars?

What's important is that you understand how the tools you use work, and
whether their behavior is compatible with your objectives, repainting or
not. As you will learn if you read this page, repainting is a complex
matter. It has many faces and many causes. Even if you don't program in
Pine Script™, this page will help you understand the array of causes
that can lead to repainting, and hopefully enable more meaningful
discussions with script authors.

### [For Pine Script™ programmers](https://www.tradingview.com#for-pine-script-programmers)

As discussed above, not all forms of repainting behavior must be avoided
at all costs, nor is all potential repainting behavior necessarily
avoidable. We hope this page helps you better understand the dynamics at
play so that you can design your trading tools with these behaviors in
mind. This page's content should help make you aware of common coding
mistakes that produce misleading repainting results.

Whatever your design decisions are, if you
[publish](#publishing) your script,
explain the script to traders so they can understand how it behaves.

This page covers three broad categories of repainting causes:

- [Historical vs realtime calculations](#historical-vs-realtime-calculations)
- [Plotting in the past](#plotting-in-the-past)
- [Dataset variations](#dataset-variations)

## [Historical vs realtime calculations](https://www.tradingview.com#historical-vs-realtime-calculations)

### [Fluid data values](https://www.tradingview.com#fluid-data-values)

Historical data does not include records of intermediary price movements
on bars; only
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) and
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
values (OHLC).

On realtime bars (bars running when the instrument's market is open),
however, the
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) and
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
values are not fixed; they can change values many times before the
realtime bar closes and its HLC values are fixed. They are *fluid*. This
leads to a script sometimes working differently on historical data and
in real time, where only the
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
price will not change during the bar.

Any script using values like
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) and
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
in realtime is subject to producing calculations that may not be
repeatable on historical bars — thus repaint.

Let's look at this simple script. It detects crosses of the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
value (in the realtime bar, this corresponds to the current price of the
instrument) over and under an
[EMA](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592270):

![image](images/Repainting-01.B4bnEQz8_PQ677.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close, ma)
xDn = ta.crossunder(close, ma)
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

Note that:

- The script uses
  [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
  to color the background green when
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  crosses over the EMA, and red on crosses under the EMA.
- The screen snapshot shows the script in realtime on a 30sec
  chart. A cross over the EMA has been detected, thus the
  background of the realtime bar is green.
- The problem here is that nothing guarantees this condition will
  hold true until the end of the realtime bar. The arrow points to
  the timer showing that 21 seconds remain in the realtime bar,
  and anything could happen until then.
- We are witnessing a repainting script.

To prevent this repainting, we must rewrite our script so that it does
not use values that fluctuate during the realtime bar. This will require
using values from a bar that has elapsed (typically the preceding bar),
or the
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
price, which does not vary in realtime.

We can achieve this in many ways. This method adds a
`and barstate.isconfirmed` condition to our cross detections, which
requires the script to be executing on the bar's last iteration, when
it closes and prices are confirmed. It is a simple way to avoid
repainting:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close, ma) and barstate.isconfirmed
xDn = ta.crossunder(close, ma) and barstate.isconfirmed
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

This uses the crosses detected on the previous bar:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close, ma)[1]
xDn = ta.crossunder(close, ma)[1]
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

This uses only confirmed
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
and EMA values for its calculations:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close[1], 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close[1], ma)
xDn = ta.crossunder(close[1], ma)
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

This detects crosses between the realtime bar's
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
and the value of the EMA from the previous bars. Notice that the EMA is
calculated using
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
so it repaints. We must ensure we use a confirmed value to detect
crosses, thus `ma[1]` in the cross detection logic:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(open, ma[1])
xDn = ta.crossunder(open, ma[1])
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

**All these methods have one thing in common: while they prevent
repainting, they will also trigger signals later than repainting
scripts. This is an inevitable compromise if one wants to avoid
repainting. You can't have your cake and eat it too.**

### [Repainting `request.security()` calls](https://www.tradingview.com#repainting-requestsecurity-calls)

The
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
function behaves differently on historical and realtime bars. On
historical bars, it only returns *confirmed* values from its requested
context, wheras it can return *unconfirmed* values on realtime bars.
When the script restarts its execution, the bars that had a realtime
state become historical bars, and will therefore only contain the values
it confirmed on those bars. If the values returned by
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
fluctuate on realtime bars without confirmation from the context, the
script will repaint them when it restarts its execution. See the
[Historical and realtime behavior](#historical-and-realtime-behavior) section of the
[Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page for a detailed explanation.

One can ensure higher-timeframe data requests only return confirmed
values on all bars, regardless of bar state, by offsetting the
`expression` argument by at least one bar with the history-referencing
operator
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D)
and using
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on)
for the `lookahead` argument in the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call, as explained
[here](#higher-timeframe-data).

The script below demonstrates the difference between repainting and
non-repainting HTF data requests. It contains two
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
calls. The first function call requests
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
data from the `higherTimeframe` without additional specification, and
the second call requests the same series with an offset and
[barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barmerge.lookahead_on).

As we see on all
[realtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isrealtime)
bars (the ones with an orange background), the `repaintingClose`
contains values that fluctuate without confirmation from the
`higherTimeframe`, meaning it will *repaint* when the script restarts
its execution. The `nonRepaintingClose`, on the other hand, behaves the
same on realtime and historical bars, i.e., it only changes its value
when new, confirmed data is available:

![image](images/Repainting-Repainting-request-security-calls-1.DKoD6okt_2uKSkR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Repainting vs non-repainting `request.security()` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The timeframe to request data from.
string higherTimeframe = input.timeframe("30", "Timeframe")

if timeframe.in_seconds() > timeframe.in_seconds(higherTimeframe)
    runtime.error("The 'Timeframe' input is smaller than the chart's timeframe. Choose a higher timeframe.")

//@variable The current `close` requested from the `higherTimeframe`. Fluctuates without confirmation on realtime bars.
float repaintingClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, higherTimeframe, close)
//@variable The last confirmed `close` requested from the `higherTimeframe`. 
// Behaves the same on historical and realtime bars.
float nonRepaintingClose = request.security(
     syminfo.tickerid, higherTimeframe, close[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on
 )

// Plot the values.
plot(repaintingClose, "Repainting close", color.new(color.purple, 50), 8)
plot(nonRepaintingClose, "Non-repainting close", color.teal, 3)
// Plot a shape when a new `higherTimeframe` starts.
plotshape(timeframe.change(higherTimeframe), "Timeframe change marker", shape.square, location.top, size = size.small)
// Color the background on realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 60) : na, title = "Realtime bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- We used the
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  function to mark the chart when there's a
  [change](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change)
  on the `higherTimeframe`.
- This script produces a [runtime
  error](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_runtime.error)
  if the `higherTimeframe` is lower than the chart's timeframe.
- On historical bars, the `repaintingClose` has a new value at the
  *end* of each timeframe, and the `nonRepaintingClose` has a new
  value at the *start* of each timeframe.

For the sake of easy reusability, below is a simple a
`noRepaintSecurity()` function that one can apply in their scripts to
request non-repainting higher-timeframe values:

```
//@function Requests non-repainting `expression` values from the context of the `symbol` and `timeframe`.
noRepaintSecurity(symbol, timeframe, expression) =>
    request.security(symbol, timeframe, expression[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
```

Note that:

- The `[1]` offset to the series and the use of
  `lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on` are interdependent. One
  **cannot** be removed without compromising the integrity of the
  function.
- Unlike a plain
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call, this wrapper function cannot accept tuple `expression`
  arguments. For multi-element use cases, one can pass a
  [user-defined type](#user-defined-types) whose fields contain the desired elements to
  request.

### [Using `request.security()` at lower timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#using-requestsecurity-at-lower-timeframes)

Some scripts use
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
to request data from a timeframe **lower** than the chart's timeframe.
This can be useful when functions specifically designed to handle
intrabars at lower timeframes are sent down the timeframe. When this
type of user-defined function requires the detection of the intrabars'
first bar, as most do, the technique will only work on historical bars.
This is due to the fact that realtime intrabars are not yet sorted. The
impact of this is that such scripts cannot reproduce in real time their
behavior on historical bars. Any logic generating alerts, for example,
will be flawed, and constant refreshing will be required to recalculate
elapsed realtime bars as historical bars.

When used at lower timeframes than the chart's without specialized
functions able to distinguish between intrabars,
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
will only return the value of the **last** intrabar in the dilation of
the chart's bar, which is usually not useful, and will also not
reproduce in real time, so lead to repainting.

For all these reasons, unless you understand the subtleties of using
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
at lower timeframes than the chart's, it is best to avoid using the
function at those timeframes. Higher-quality scripts will have logic to
detect such anomalies and prevent the display of results which would be
invalid when a lower timeframe is used.

For more reliable lower-timeframe data requests, use
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf),
as explained in
[this](#lower-timeframe-data) section of the
[Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page.

### [Future leak with `request.security()`](https://www.tradingview.com#future-leak-with-requestsecurity)

When
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
is used with `lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on` to fetch prices without
offsetting the series by `[1]`, it will return data from the future on
historical bars, which is dangerously misleading.

While historical bars will magically display future prices before they
should be known, no lookahead is possible in realtime because the future
there is unknown, as it should, so no future bars exist.

This is an example:

![image](images/Repainting-FutureLeakWithRequestSecurity-01.B8DsNHGV_Kgu8T.png)

```
// FUTURE LEAK! DO NOT USE!
//@version=6
indicator("Future leak", "", true)
futureHigh = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", high, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
plot(futureHigh)
```

Note how the higher timeframe line is showing the timeframe's
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
value before it occurs. The solution to avoid this effect is to use the
function as demonstrated in
[this section](#repainting-requestsecurity-calls).

Using lookahead to produce misleading results is not allowed in script
publications, as explained in the
[lookahead](#lookahead) section of the
[Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page. Script publications that use this misleading technique
**will be moderated**.

### [`varip`](https://www.tradingview.com#varip)

Scripts using the
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
declaration mode for variables (see our section on
[varip](#varip)
for more information) save information across realtime updates, which
cannot be reproduced on historical bars where only OHLC information is
available. Such scripts may be useful in realtime, including to generate
alerts, but their logic cannot be backtested, nor can their plots on
historical bars reflect calculations that will be done in realtime.

### [Bar state built-ins](https://www.tradingview.com#bar-state-built-ins)

Scripts using [bar states](#bar-states)
may or may not repaint. As we have seen in the previous section, using
[barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disconfirmed)
is actually one way to **avoid** repainting that **will** reproduce on
historical bars, which are always "confirmed". Uses of other bar
states such as
[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew),
however, will lead to repainting. The reason is that on historical bars,
[barstate.isnew](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Disnew)
is `true` on the bar's
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
yet in realtime, it is `true` on the bar's
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#open).
Using the other bar state variables will usually cause some type of
behavioral discrepancy between historical and realtime bars.

### [`timenow`](https://www.tradingview.com#timenow)

The
[timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow)
built-in returns the current time. Scripts using this variable cannot
show consistent historical and realtime behavior, so they necessarily
repaint.

### [Strategies](https://www.tradingview.com#strategies)

Strategies using `calc_on_every_tick = true` execute on each realtime
update, while strategies run on the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
of historical bars. They will most probably not generate the same order
executions, and so repaint. Note that when this happens, it also
invalidates backtesting results, as they are not representative of the
strategy's behavior in realtime.

## [Plotting in the past](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting-in-the-past)

Scripts detecting pivots after 5 bars have elapsed will often go back in
the past to plot pivot levels or values on the actual pivot, 5 bars in
the past. This will often cause unsuspecting traders looking at plots on
historical bars to infer that when the pivot happens in realtime, the
same plots will apppear on the pivot when it occurs, as opposed to when
it is detected.

Let's look at a script showing the price of high pivots by placing the
price in the past, 5 bars after the pivot was detected:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting in the past", "", true)
pHi = ta.pivothigh(5, 5)
if not na(pHi)
    label.new(bar_index[5], na, str.tostring(pHi, format.mintick) + "\n🠇", yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_none, textcolor = color.black, size = size.normal)
```

![image](images/Repainting-PlottingInThePast-01.CdfEKXRh_VvvoS.png)

Note that:

- This script repaints because an elapsed realtime bar showing no
  price may get a price placed on it if it is identified as a pivot, 5
  bars after the actual pivot occurs.
- The display looks great, but it can be misleading.

The best solution to this problem when developing script for others is
to plot **without** an offset by default, but give the option for script
users to turn on plotting in the past through inputs, so they are
necessarily aware of what the script is doing, e.g.:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting in the past", "", true)
plotInThePast = input(false, "Plot in the past")
pHi = ta.pivothigh(5, 5)
if not na(pHi)
    label.new(bar_index[plotInThePast ? 5 : 0], na, str.tostring(pHi, format.mintick) + "\n🠇", yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_none, textcolor = color.black, size = size.normal)
```

## [Dataset variations](https://www.tradingview.com#dataset-variations)

### [Starting points](https://www.tradingview.com#starting-points)

Scripts begin executing on the chart's first historical bar, and then
execute on each bar sequentially, as is explained in this manual's page
on Pine Script™'s
[execution model](#execution-model). If
the first bar changes, then the script will often not calculate the same
way it did when the dataset began at a different point in time.

The following factors have an impact on the quantity of bars you see on
your charts, and their *starting point*:

- The type of account you hold
- The historical data available from the data supplier
- The alignment requirements of the dataset, which determine its
  *starting point*

These are the account-specific bar limits:

- 40000 historical bars for the Ultimate plan.
- 25000 historical bars for the Expert plan.
- 20000 historical bars for the Premium plan.
- 10000 historical bars for Essential and Plus plans.
- 5000 historical bars for other plans.

Starting points are determined using the following rules, which depend
on the chart's timeframe:

- **Tick-based timeframes**: return the exact number of bars based on the plan.
- **Second-based timeframes**: aligns to the beginning of a day.
- **1 - 14 minutes**: aligns to the beginning of a week.
- **15 - 29 minutes**: aligns to the beginning of a month.
- **30 - 1439 minutes**: aligns to the beginning of a year.
- **1440 minutes and higher**: aligns to the first available
  historical data point.

As time goes by, these factors cause your chart's history to start at
different points in time. This often has an impact on your scripts
calculations, because changes in calculation results in early bars can
ripple through all the other bars in the dataset. Using functions like
[ta.valuewhen()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dvaluewhen),
[ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dbarssince)
or
[ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dema),
for example, will yield results that vary with early history.

### [Revision of historical data](https://www.tradingview.com#revision-of-historical-data)

Historical and realtime bars are built using two different data feeds
supplied by exchanges/brokers: historical data, and realtime data. When
realtime bars elapse, exchanges/brokers sometimes make what are usually
small adjustments to bar prices, which are then written to their
historical data. When the chart is refreshed or the script is
re-executed on those elapsed realtime bars, they will then be built and
calculated using the historical data, which will contain those usually
small price revisions, if any have been made.

Historical data may also be revised for other reasons, e.g., for stock
splits.

#### Plots](#plots)[Next

#### Sessions](#sessions)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Sessions

# [Sessions](https://www.tradingview.com#sessions)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Session information is usable in three different ways in Pine Script™:

1. **Session strings** containing from-to start times and day
   information that can be used in functions such as
   [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
   and
   [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close)
   to detect when bars are in a particular time period, with the option
   of limiting valid sessions to specific days. The
   [input.session()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsession)
   function provides a way to allow script users to define session
   values through a script's "Inputs" tab (see the
   [Session input](#session-input) section for more information).
2. **Session states** built-in variables such as
   [session.ismarket](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_session%7Bdot%7Dismarket)
   can identify which session a bar belongs to.
3. When fetching data with
   [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
   you can also choose to return data from *regular* sessions only or
   *extended* sessions. In this case, the definition of **regular and
   extended sessions** is that of the exchange. It is part of the
   instrument's properties — not user-defined, as in point #1. This
   notion of *regular* and *extended* sessions is the same one used in
   the chart's interface, in the "Chart Settings/Symbol/Session"
   field, for example.

The following sections cover both methods of using session information
in Pine Script™.

Note that:

- Not all user accounts on TradingView have access to extended session
  information.
- There is no special "session" type in Pine Script™. Instead,
  session strings are of "string" type but must conform to the
  session string syntax.

## [Session strings](https://www.tradingview.com#session-strings)

### [Session string specifications](https://www.tradingview.com#session-string-specifications)

Session strings used with
[time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
and
[time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close)
must have a specific format. Their syntax is:

```
<time_period>:<days>
```

Where:

- <time_period> uses times in "hhmm" format, with "hh" in 24-hour format, so `1700` for 5PM.

The time periods are in the "hhmm-hhmm" format, and a comma can
separate multiple time periods to specify combinations of discrete
periods.

For example, - <days> is a set of digits from 1 to 7 that specifies on which days the session is valid.

1 is Sunday, 7 is Saturday.

These are examples of session strings:

`"24x7"`

A 7-day, 24-hour session beginning at midnight.

`"0000-0000:1234567"`

Equivalent to the previous example.

`"0000-0000"`

Equivalent to the previous two examples because the default days are
`1234567`.

`"0000-0000:23456"`

The same as the previous example, but only Monday to Friday.

`"2000-1630:1234567"`

An overnight session that begins at 20:00 and ends at 16:30 the next
day. It is valid on all days of the week.

`"0930-1700:146"`

A session that begins at 9:30 and ends at 17:00 on Sundays (1),
Wednesdays (4), and Fridays (6).

`"1700-1700:23456"`

An *overnight session*. The Monday session starts Sunday at 17:00
and ends Monday at 17:00. It is valid Monday through Friday.

`"1000-1001:26"`

A weird session that lasts only one minute on Mondays (2) and
Fridays (6).

`"0900-1600,1700-2000"`

A session that begins at 9:00, breaks from 16:00 to 17:00, and
continues until 20:00. Applies to every day of the week.

### [Using session strings](https://www.tradingview.com#using-session-strings)

Session properties defined with session strings are independent of the
exchange-defined sessions determining when an instrument can be traded.
Programmers have complete liberty in creating whatever session
definitions suit their purpose, which is usually to detect when bars
belong to specific time periods. This is accomplished in Pine Script™ by
using one of the following two signatures of the
[time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
function:

```
time(timeframe, session, timezone) → series inttime(timeframe, session) → series int
```

Here, we use
[time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
with a `session` argument to display the market's opening
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
values on an intraday chart:

![image](images/Sessions-UsingSessionStrings-01.CCTz2lcx_1mB945.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Opening high/low", overlay = true)

sessionInput = input.session("0930-0935")

sessionBegins(sess) =>
    t = time("", sess)
    timeframe.isintraday and (not barstate.isfirst) and na(t[1]) and not na(t)

var float hi = na
var float lo = na
if sessionBegins(sessionInput)
    hi := high
    lo := low

plot(lo, "lo", color.fuchsia, 2, plot.style_circles)
plot(hi, "hi", color.lime,    2, plot.style_circles)
```

Note that:

- We use a session input to allow users to specify the time they want
  to detect. We are only looking for the session's beginning time on
  bars, so we use a five-minute gap between the beginning and end time
  of our `"0930-0935"` default value.
- We create a `sessionBegins()` function to detect the beginning of a
  session. Its `time("", sess)` call uses an empty string for the
  function's `timeframe` parameter, which means it uses the chart's
  timeframe, whatever that is. The function returns `true` when:
    - The chart uses an intraday timeframe (seconds or minutes).
    - The script isn't on the chart's first bar, which we ensure with
      `(not barstate.isfirst)`. This check prevents the code from always
      detecting a session beginning on the first bar because
      `na(t[1]) and not na(t)` is always `true` there.
    - The [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
      call has returned [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
      on the previous bar because it wasn't in the session's time
      period, and it has returned a value that is not
      [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
      on the current bar, which means the bar is **in** the session's
      time period.

## [Session states](https://www.tradingview.com#session-states)

Three built-in variables allow you to distinguish the type of session
the current bar belongs to. They are only helpful on intraday
timeframes:

- [session.ismarket](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_session%7Bdot%7Dismarket)
  returns `true` when the bar belongs to regular trading hours.
- [session.ispremarket](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_session%7Bdot%7Dispremarket)
  returns `true` when the bar belongs to the extended session
  preceding regular trading hours.
- [session.ispostmarket](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_session%7Bdot%7Dispostmarket)
  returns `true` when the bar belongs to the extended session
  following regular trading hours.

## [Using sessions with `request.security()`](https://www.tradingview.com#using-sessions-with-requestsecurity)

When your TradingView account provides access to extended sessions, you
can choose to see their bars with the "Settings/Symbol/Session" field.
There are two types of sessions:

- **regular** (which does not include pre- and post-market data), and
- **extended** (which includes pre- and post-market data).

Scripts using the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
function to access data can return extended session data or not. This is
an example where only regular session data is fetched:

![image](images/Sessions-RegularAndExtendedSessions-01.F4CwBAHR_1pM3j5.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 1: Regular Session Data")
regularSessionData = request.security("NASDAQ:AAPL", timeframe.period, close, barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(regularSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

If you want the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
call to return extended session data, you must first use the
[ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dnew)
function to build the first argument of the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
call:

![image](images/Sessions-RegularAndExtendedSessions-02.D3WOi9Aa_2jwV7m.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 2: Extended Session Data")
t = ticker.new("NASDAQ", "AAPL", session.extended)
extendedSessionData = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close, barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(extendedSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

Note that the previous chart's gaps in the script's plot are now
filled. Also, keep in mind that our example scripts do not produce the
background coloring on the chart; it is due to the chart's settings
showing extended hours.

The
[ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dnew)
function has the following signature:

```
ticker.new(prefix, ticker, session, adjustment) → simple string
```

Where:

- `prefix` is the exchange prefix, e.g., `"NASDAQ"`
- `ticker` is a symbol name, e.g., `"AAPL"`
- `session` can be `session.extended` or `session.regular`. Note that
  this is **not** a session string.
- `adjustment` adjusts prices using different criteria:
  `adjustment.none`, `adjustment.splits`, `adjustment.dividends`.

Our first example could be rewritten as:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 1: Regular Session Data")
t = ticker.new("NASDAQ", "AAPL", session.regular)
regularSessionData = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close, barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(regularSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

If you want to use the same session specifications used for the chart's
main symbol, omit the third argument in
[ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dnew);
it is optional. If you want your code to declare your intention
explicitly, use the
[syminfo.session](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dsession)
built-in variable. It holds the session type of the chart's main
symbol:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example 1: Regular Session Data")
t = ticker.new("NASDAQ", "AAPL", syminfo.session)
regularSessionData = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close, barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(regularSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

# [Strategies](https://www.tradingview.com#strategies)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ Strategies are specialized scripts that simulate trades across historical and realtime bars, allowing users to backtest and forward test their trading systems. Strategy scripts have many of the same capabilities as [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) scripts, and they provide the ability to place, modify, and cancel hypothetical orders and analyze performance results.

When a script uses the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function as its declaration statement, it gains access to the `strategy.*` namespace, which features numerous functions and variables for simulating orders and retrieving essential strategy information. It also displays relevant information and simulated performance results in the dedicated [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) tab.

## [A simple strategy example](https://www.tradingview.com#a-simple-strategy-example)

The following script is a simple strategy that simulates entering a long or short position when two moving averages cross. When the `fastMA` crosses above the `slowMA`, it places a "buy" market order to enter a long position. When the `fastMA` crosses below the `slowMA`, it places a "sell" market order to enter a short position:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Simple strategy demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@variable The length of the `fastMA` and half the length of the `slowMA`.
int lengthInput = input.int(14, "Base length", 2)

// Calculate two moving averages with different lengths.
float fastMA = ta.sma(close, lengthInput)
float slowMA = ta.sma(close, lengthInput * 2)

// Place an order to enter a long position when `fastMA` crosses over `slowMA`.
if ta.crossover(fastMA, slowMA)
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)

// Place an order to enter a short position when `fastMA` crosses under `slowMA`.
if ta.crossunder(fastMA, slowMA)
    strategy.entry("sell", strategy.short)

// Plot the moving averages.
plot(fastMA, "Fast MA", color.aqua)
plot(slowMA, "Slow MA", color.orange)
```

Note that:

- The [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function call declares that the script is a strategy named "Simple strategy demo" that displays visuals on the main chart pane.
- The `margin_long` and `margin_short` arguments in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) call specify that the strategy must have 100% of a long or short trade's amount available to allow the trade. See [this section](#margin) for more information.
- The [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) function is the command that the script uses to create entry orders and reverse positions. The "buy" entry order closes any short position and opens a new long position. The "sell" entry order closes any long position and opens a new short position.

## [Applying a strategy to a chart](https://www.tradingview.com#applying-a-strategy-to-a-chart)

To test a strategy, add it to the chart. Select a built-in or published strategy from the "Indicators, Metrics & Strategies" menu, or write a custom strategy in the Pine Editor and click the "Add to chart" option in the top-right corner:

![image](images/Strategies-Applying-a-strategy-to-a-chart-1.N4wBY_BO_Z2vpEWq.png)

The script plots trade markers on the main chart pane and displays simulated performance results inside the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) tab:

![image](images/Strategies-Applying-a-strategy-to-a-chart-2.DYfs3WKI_Z1EwIMy.png)

## [Strategy Tester](https://www.tradingview.com#strategy-tester)

The *Strategy Tester* visualizes the hypothetical performance of a strategy script and displays its properties. To use it, add a script declared with the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function to the chart, then open the "Strategy Tester" tab. If two or more strategies are on the chart, specify which one to analyze by selecting its name in the top-left corner.

After the selected script executes across the chart's data, the Strategy Tester populates the following four tabs with relevant strategy information:

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Performance Summary](#performance-summary)
- [List of Trades](#list-of-trades)
- [Properties](#properties)

### [Overview](https://www.tradingview.com#overview)

The [Overview](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000681733) tab provides a quick look into a strategy's performance over a sequence of simulated trades. This tab displays essential performance metrics and a chart with three helpful plots:

- The [Equity](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000681735) baseline plot visualizes the strategy's simulated equity across closed trades.
- The [Drawdown](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000681734) column plot shows how far the strategy's equity fell below its peak across trades.
- The [Buy & hold equity](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000681736) plot shows the equity growth of a strategy that enters a single long position and holds that position throughout the testing range.

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-tester-Overview-1.DOd5fCK__1TlKcc.png)

Note that:

- The chart has two separate vertical scales. The "Equity" and "Buy & hold equity" plots use the scale on the left, and the "Drawdown" plot uses the scale on the right. Users can toggle the plots and choose between absolute or percentage scales using the options at the bottom.
- When a user clicks on a point in this chart, the main chart scrolls to the corresponding bar where the trade closed and displays a tooltip containing the closing time.

### [Performance Summary](https://www.tradingview.com#performance-summary)

The [Performance Summary](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000681683) tab presents an in-depth summary of a strategy's key performance metrics, organized into separate columns. The "All" column shows performance information for all simulated trades, and the "Long" and "Short" columns show relevant metrics separately for long and short trades. This view provides more detailed insights into a strategy's overall and directional trading performance:

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-tester-Performance-summary-1.BWnlmBT7_Z38011.png)

### [List of Trades](https://www.tradingview.com#list-of-trades)

The [List of Trades](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000681737) tab chronologically lists a strategy's simulated trades. Each item in the list displays vital information about a trade, including the dates and times of entry and exit orders, the names of the orders, the order prices, and the number of contracts/shares/lots/units. In addition, each item shows the trade's profit or loss and the strategy's cumulative profit, run-up, and drawdown:

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-tester-List-of-trades-1.Chdio170_1pKv1G.png)

Note that:

- Hovering the mouse over a list item's entry or exit information reveals a "Scroll to bar" button. Clicking that button navigates the main chart to the bar where the entry or exit occurred.
- The list shows each trade in *descending* order by default, with the latest trade at the top. Users can reverse this order by clicking the "Trade #" button above the list.

### [Properties](https://www.tradingview.com#properties)

The "Properties" tab provides detailed information about a strategy's configuration and the dataset that it executes across, organized into four collapsible sections:

- The "Date Range" section shows the range of dates that had simulated trades, and the overall available backtesting range.
- The "Symbol Info" section displays the chart's symbol, timeframe, type, point value, currency, and tick size. It also includes the chart's specified precision setting.
- The "Strategy Inputs" section lists the names and values of all the inputs available in the strategy's "Settings/Inputs" tab. This section only appears if the script includes `input*()` calls or specifies a nonzero `calc_bars_count` argument in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement.
- The "Strategy Properties" section provides an overview of the strategy's [properties](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000628599-strategy-properties/), including the initial capital, account currency, order size, margin, pyramiding, commission, slippage, and other settings.

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-tester-Properties-1.DEisjv-X_Z5vT3G.png)

## [Broker emulator](https://www.tradingview.com#broker-emulator)

TradingView uses a *broker emulator* to simulate trades while running a strategy script. Unlike in real-world trading, the emulator fills a strategy's orders exclusively using available *chart data* by default. Consequently, it executes orders on historical bars *after a bar closes*. Similarly, the earliest point that it can fill orders on realtime bars is after a new price tick. For more information about this behavior, see the [Execution model](#execution-model) page.

Because the broker emulator only uses price data from the chart by default, it makes *assumptions* about intrabar price movement when filling orders. The emulator analyzes the opening, high, low, and closing prices of chart bars to infer intrabar activity using the following logic:

- If the opening price of a bar is closer to the high than the low, the emulator assumes that the market price moved in this order: **open → high → low → close**.
- If the opening price of a bar is closer to the low than the high, the emulator assumes that the market price moved in this order: **open → low → high → close**.
- The emulator assumes *no gaps* exist between intrabars inside each chart bar, meaning it considers *any* value within a bar's high-low range as a valid price for order execution.
- When filling *price-based orders* (all orders except [market orders](#market-orders)), the emulator assumes intrabars **do not** exist within the gap between the previous bar's close and the current bar's open. If the market price crosses an order's price during the gap between two bars, the emulator fills the order at the current bar's *open* and not at the specified price.

![image](images/Strategies-Broker-emulator-1.TOD5mNOt_1q8drI.png)

### [Bar magnifier](https://www.tradingview.com#bar-magnifier)

Users with Premium and higher-tier [plans](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/) can override the broker emulator's default assumptions about intrabar prices by enabling the [Bar Magnifier](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000669285) backtesting mode. In this mode, the emulator uses data from *lower timeframes* to obtain more granular information about price action within bars, allowing more precise order fills in the strategy's simulation.

To enable the [Bar Magnifier](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000669285) mode, include `use_bar_magnifier = true` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, or select the "Using bar magnifier" option in the "Fill orders" section of the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab.

The following example script illustrates how the Bar Magnifier can enhance order-fill behavior. When the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value crosses the defined `orderTime`, it creates "Buy" and "Exit" [limit orders](#limit-orders) at the calculated `entryPrice` and `exitPrice`. For visual reference, the script colors the background orange when it places the orders, and it draws two horizontal [lines](#lines) at the order prices:

![image](images/Strategies-Broker-emulator-Bar-magnifier-1.coZBXeS5_Z73KL6.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Bar Magnifier Demo", overlay = true, use_bar_magnifier = false)

//@variable The UNIX timestamp to place the order at.
int orderTime = timestamp("UTC", 2023, 3, 22, 18)

//@variable Is `color.orange` when `time` crosses the `orderTime`, false otherwise.
color orderColor = na

// Entry and exit prices.
float entryPrice = hl2 - (high - low)
float exitPrice  = entryPrice + (high - low) * 0.25

// Entry and exit lines.
var line entryLine = na
var line exitLine  = na

if ta.cross(time, orderTime)
    // Draw new entry and exit lines.
    entryLine := line.new(bar_index, entryPrice, bar_index + 1, entryPrice, color = color.green, width = 2)
    exitLine  := line.new(bar_index, exitPrice, bar_index + 1, exitPrice, color = color.red, width = 2)

    // Update order highlight color.
    orderColor := color.new(color.orange, 80)

    // Place limit orders at the `entryPrice` and `exitPrice`.
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, limit = entryPrice)
    strategy.exit("Exit", "Buy", limit = exitPrice)

// Update lines while the position is open.
else if strategy.position_size > 0.0
    entryLine.set_x2(bar_index + 1)
    exitLine.set_x2(bar_index + 1)

bgcolor(orderColor)
```

Because the script does not include a `use_bar_magnifier` argument in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function, the broker emulator uses the default [assumptions](#broker-emulator) when filling the orders: that the bar's price moved from open to high, high to low, and then low to close. Therefore, after filling the "Buy" order at the price indicated by the green line, the broker emulator inferred that the market price did not go back up to touch the red line and trigger the "Exit" order. In other words, the strategy *could not* enter and exit the position on the same bar according to the broker emulator's assumptions.

After we enable the [Bar Magnifier](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000669285) mode, the broker emulator can access *10-minute* data on the 60-minute chart instead of relying on its assumptions about hourly bars. On this timeframe, the market price *did* move back up to the "Exit" order's price after reaching the "Buy" order's price in the same hour. Therefore, with the Bar Magnifier enabled in this scenario, both orders execute on the same hourly bar:

![image](images/Strategies-Broker-emulator-Bar-magnifier-2.BNRDP6RA_1rU9cu.png)

## [Orders and trades](https://www.tradingview.com#orders-and-trades)

Pine Script™ strategies use orders to make trades and manage positions, similar to real-world trading. In this context, an *order* is an instruction that a strategy sends to the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) to perform a market action, and a *trade* is the resulting transaction after the emulator fills an order.

Let's take a closer look at how strategy orders work and how they become trades. Every 20 bars, the following script creates a long [market order](#market-orders) with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) and draws a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label). It calls [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) on each bar from the global scope to generate a market order to close any open position:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-1.CX7qCrxg_Z2raUd5.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Order execution demo", "My strategy", true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@function Displays the specified `txt` in a label at the `high` of the current bar. 
debugLabel(string txt) => 
    label.new(
         bar_index, high, text = txt, color=color.lime, style = label.style_label_lower_right, 
         textcolor = color.black, size = size.large
     )

//@variable Is `true` on every 20th bar, `false` otherwise.
bool longCondition = bar_index % 20 == 0

// Draw a label and place a long market order when `longCondition` occurs.
if longCondition
    debugLabel("Long entry order created")
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

// Place a closing market order whenever there is an open position.
strategy.close_all()
```

Note that:

- Although the script calls [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) on every bar, the function only creates a new exit order when the strategy has an *open position*. If there is no open position, the function call has no effect.

The blue arrows on the above chart show where the strategy entered a long position, and the purple arrows mark the bars where the strategy closed the position. Notice that the [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) drawings appear one bar *before* the entry markers, and the entry markers appear one bar *before* the closing markers. This sequence illustrates order creation and execution in action.

By default, the earliest point the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills an order is on the next available price tick, because creating and filling an order on the same tick is unrealistic. Since strategies recalculate after each bar closes by default, the next available tick where the emulator fills a generated order is at the *open* of the *following bar*. For example, when the `longCondition` occurs on bar 20, the script places an entry order to fill on the next tick, which is at the open of bar 21. When the strategy recalculates its values after bar 21 closes, it places an order to close the current position on the next tick, which is at the open of bar 22.

## [Order types](https://www.tradingview.com#order-types)

Pine Script™ strategies can simulate different order types to suit specific trading system needs. The main notable order types include [market](#market-orders), [limit](#limit-orders), [stop](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders), and [stop-limit](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders).

### [Market orders](https://www.tradingview.com#market-orders)

A *market order* is the simplest type of order, which most [order placement commands](#order-placement-and-cancellation) generate by default. A market order is an instruction to buy or sell a security as soon as possible, irrespective of the price. As such, the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) always executes a market order on the next available tick.

The example below alternates between placing a long and short market order once every `lengthInput` bars. When the [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) is divisible by `2 * lengthInput`, the strategy generates a long market order. Otherwise, it places a short market order when the [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) is divisible by the `lengthInput`:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-types-1.XLQDthDF_Z1YB5yU.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Market order demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@variable Number of bars between long and short entries.
int lengthInput = input.int(10, "Cycle length", 1)

//@function Displays the specified `txt` in a label on the current bar.
debugLabel(string txt, color lblColor) => label.new(
     bar_index, high, text = txt, color = lblColor, textcolor = color.white, 
     style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
 )

//@variable Is `true` every `2 * lengthInput` bars, `false` otherwise.
longCondition = bar_index % (2 * lengthInput) == 0
//@variable Is `true` every `lengthInput` bars, `false` otherwise.
shortCondition = bar_index % lengthInput == 0

// Generate a long market order with a `color.green` label on `longCondition`.
if longCondition
    debugLabel("Long market order created", color.green)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)
// Otherwise, generate a short market order with a `color.red` label on `shortCondition`.
else if shortCondition
    debugLabel("Short market order created", color.red)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)
```

Note that:

- The [labels](#labels) indicate the bars where the script generates the market orders. The broker emulator fills each order at the open of the following bar.
- The [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command can automatically *reverse* an open position in the opposite direction. See [this section](#reversing-positions) below for more information.

### [Limit orders](https://www.tradingview.com#limit-orders)

A *limit order* is an instruction to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better (lower than specified for long orders, and higher than specified for short orders), irrespective of the time. To simulate a limit order in a strategy script, pass a *price* value to the `limit` parameter of an applicable [order placement command](#order-placement-and-cancellation).

When the market price reaches a limit order's value, or crosses it in the favorable direction, the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills the order at that value or a better price. When a strategy generates a limit order at a *worse* value than the current market price (higher for long orders and lower for short orders), the emulator fills the order without waiting for the market price to reach that value.

For example, the following script generates a long limit order 800 ticks below the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) of the bar 100 bars before the last chart bar using the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command. It draws a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) to signify the bar where the strategy created the order and a [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) to visualize the order's price:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-types-2.Ma_eheTS_1mD31p.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Limit order demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@function Displays text passed to `txt` and a horizontal line at `price` when called.
debugLabel(float price, string txt) =>
    label.new(
         bar_index, price, text = txt, color = color.teal, textcolor = color.white, 
         style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
     )
    line.new(
         bar_index, price, bar_index + 1, price, color = color.teal, extend = extend.right, 
         style = line.style_dashed
     )

// Generate a long limit order with a label and line 100 bars before the `last_bar_index`.
if last_bar_index - bar_index == 100
    limitPrice = close - syminfo.mintick * 800
    debugLabel(limitPrice, "Long Limit order created")
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, limit = limitPrice)
```

Notice that in the chart above, the [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) and the start of the [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) occurred several bars before the "Long" entry marker. The [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) could not fill the order while the market price remained *above* the `limitPrice` because such a price is a *worse* value for the long trade. After the price fell and reached the `limitPrice`, the emulator filled the order mid-bar at that value.

If we set the `limitPrice` to a value *above* the bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) rather than *below*, the broker emulator fills the order at the open of the following bar because the closing price is already a more *favorable* value for the long trade. Here, we set the `limitPrice` in the script to 800 ticks above the bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) to demonstrate this effect:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Limit order demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@function Displays text passed to `txt` and a horizontal line at `price` when called.
debugLabel(float price, string txt) =>
    label.new(
         bar_index, price, text = txt, color = color.teal, textcolor = color.white, 
         style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
     )
    line.new(
         bar_index, price, bar_index + 1, price, color = color.teal, extend = extend.right, 
         style = line.style_dashed
     )

// Generate a long limit order with a label and line 100 bars before the `last_bar_index`.
if last_bar_index - bar_index == 100
    limitPrice = close + syminfo.mintick * 800
    debugLabel(limitPrice, "Long Limit order created")
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, limit = limitPrice)
```

### [Stop and stop-limit orders](https://www.tradingview.com#stop-and-stop-limit-orders)

A *stop order* is an instruction to activate a new [market](#market-orders) or [limit](#limit-orders) order when the market price reaches a specific price or a worse value (higher than specified for long orders and lower than specified for short orders). To simulate a stop order, pass a price value to the `stop` parameter of an applicable [order placement command](#order-placement-and-cancellation).

When a strategy generates a stop order at a *better* value than the current market price, it activates the subsequent order without waiting for the market price to reach that value.

The following example calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) to place a stop order 800 ticks above the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) 100 bars before the last historical chart bar. It also draws a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) on the bar where it created the order and a [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) to display the stop price. As we see in the chart below, the strategy entered a long position immediately after the price crossed the stop level:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-types-4.BpjXSFRL_ZCMq1X.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Stop order demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@function Displays text passed to `txt` when called and shows the `price` level on the chart.
debugLabel(price, txt) =>
    label.new(
         bar_index, high, text = txt, color = color.teal, textcolor = color.white, 
         style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
     )
    line.new(bar_index, high, bar_index, price, style = line.style_dotted, color = color.teal)
    line.new(
         bar_index, price, bar_index + 1, price, color = color.teal, extend = extend.right, 
         style = line.style_dashed
     )

// Generate a long stop order with a label and lines 100 bars before the last bar.
if last_bar_index - bar_index == 100
    stopPrice = close + syminfo.mintick * 800
    debugLabel(stopPrice, "Long Stop order created")
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, stop = stopPrice)
```

Note that:

- A basic stop order is essentially the opposite of a [limit order](#limit-orders) in terms of its execution based on the market price. If we use a limit order instead of a stop order in this scenario, the order executes immediately on the next bar. See the [previous section](#limit-orders) for an example.

When a [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) or [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) call includes a `stop`*and*`limit` argument, it creates a *stop-limit order*. Unlike a basic stop order, which triggers a [market order](#market-orders) when the current price is at the `stop` level or a worse value, a stop-limit order creates a subsequent [limit order](#limit-orders) to fill at the specified `limit` price.

Below, we modified the previous script to simulate and visualize a stop-limit order. This script version includes the bar's [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) as the `limit` price in the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command. It also includes additional drawings to show where the strategy activated the subsequent limit order and to visualize the limit price.

In this example chart, notice how the market price reached the limit level on the next bar after the stop-limit order was created, but the strategy did not enter a position because the limit order was not yet active. After price later reached the stop level, the strategy placed the limit order, and then the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) filled it after the market price dropped back down to the limit level:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-types-5.CduO1Nxw_2mnPeh.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Stop-Limit order demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@function Displays text passed to `txt` when called and shows the `price` level on the chart.
debugLabel(price, txt, lblColor, lineWidth = 1) =>
    label.new(
         bar_index, high, text = txt, color = lblColor, textcolor = color.white, 
         style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
     )
    line.new(bar_index, close, bar_index, price, style = line.style_dotted, color = lblColor, width = lineWidth)
    line.new(
         bar_index, price, bar_index + 1, price, color = lblColor, extend = extend.right, 
         style = line.style_dashed, width = lineWidth
     )

var float stopPrice  = na
var float limitPrice = na

// Generate a long stop-limit order with a label and lines 100 bars before the last bar.
if last_bar_index - bar_index == 100
    stopPrice  := close + syminfo.mintick * 800
    limitPrice := low
    debugLabel(limitPrice, "", color.gray)
    debugLabel(stopPrice, "Long Stop-Limit order created", color.teal)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, stop = stopPrice, limit = limitPrice)

// Draw a line and label when the strategy activates the limit order.
if high >= stopPrice
    debugLabel(limitPrice, "Limit order activated", color.green, 2)
    stopPrice := na
```

## [Order placement and cancellation](https://www.tradingview.com#order-placement-and-cancellation)

The `strategy.*` namespace features the following five functions that simulate the placement of orders, known as *order placement commands*: [strategy.entry()](#strategyentry), [strategy.order()](#strategyorder), [strategy.exit()](#strategyexit), [strategy.close()](#strategyclose-and-strategyclose_all), and [strategy.close_all()](#strategyclose-and-strategyclose_all).

Additionally, the namespace includes the following two functions that cancel pending orders, known as *order cancellation commands*: [strategy.cancel()](#strategycancel-and-strategycancel_all) and [strategy.cancel_all()](#strategycancel-and-strategycancel_all).

The segments below explain these commands, their unique characteristics, and how to use them.

### [`strategy.entry()`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyentry)

The [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command generates *entry orders*. Its unique features help simplify opening and managing positions. This order placement command generates [market orders](#market-orders) by default. It can also create [limit](#limit-orders), [stop](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders), and [stop-limit](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders) orders with the `limit` and `stop` parameters, as explained in the [Order types](#order-types) section above.

#### [Reversing positions](https://www.tradingview.com#reversing-positions)

One of the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command's unique features is its ability to *reverse* an open position automatically. By default, when an order from [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) executes while there is an open position in the opposite direction, the command automatically *adds* the position's size to the new order's size. The added quantity allows the order to close the current position and open a new position for the specified number of contracts/lots/shares/units in the new direction.

For instance, if a strategy has an open position of 15 shares in the [strategy.long](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.long) direction and calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) to place a new [market order](#market-orders) in the [strategy.short](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.short) direction, the size of the resulting transaction is the specified entry size **plus** 15 shares.

The example below demonstrates this behavior in action. When the `buyCondition` occurs once every 100 bars, the script calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) with `qty = 15` to open a long position of 15 shares. Otherwise, when the `sellCondition` occurs on every 50th bar, the script calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) with `qty = 5` to enter a new short position of five shares. The script also highlights the chart's background on the bars where the `buyCondition` and `sellCondition` occurs:

![image](images/Strategies-Order-placement-and-cancellation-Strategy-entry-Reversing-positions-1.Cs1E9UJf_Z2uYkzU.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Reversing positions demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar, `false` otherwise.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0
//@variable Is `true` on every 50th bar, `false` otherwise.
bool sellCondition = bar_index % 50 == 0

if buyCondition
    // Place a "buy" market order to close the short position and enter a long position of 15 shares.
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, qty = 15)
else if sellCondition
    // Place a "sell" market order to close the long position and enter a short position of 5 shares.
    strategy.entry("sell", strategy.short, qty = 5)

// Highlight the background when the `buyCondition` or `sellCondition` occurs.
bgcolor(buyCondition  ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : sellCondition ? color.new(color.red, 90) : na)
```

The trade markers on the chart show the *transaction size*, not the size of the resulting position. The markers above show that the transaction size was *20 shares* on each order fill rather than 15 for long orders and five for short orders. Since [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) reverses a position in the opposite direction by default, each call *adds* the open position's size (e.g., 15 for long entries) to the new order's size (e.g., 5 for short entries), resulting in a quantity of 20 shares on each entry after the first. Although each of these *transactions* is 20 shares in size, the resulting positions are 5 shares for each short entry and 15 for each long entry.

Note that:

- The [strategy.risk.allow_entry_in()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.risk.allow_entry_in) function *overrides* the allowed direction for the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command. When a script specifies a trade direction with this [risk management](#risk-management) command, orders from [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) in the opposite direction *close* the open position without allowing a reversal.

#### [Pyramiding](https://www.tradingview.com#pyramiding)

Another unique characteristic of the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command is its connection to a strategy's *pyramiding* property. Pyramiding specifies the maximum number of *successive entries* a strategy allows in the same direction. Users can set this property by including a `pyramiding` argument in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement or by adjusting the "Pyramiding" input in the script's "Settings/Properties" tab. The default value is 1, meaning the strategy can open new positions but cannot add to them using orders from [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) calls.

The following example uses [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) to place a [market order](#market-orders) when the `entryCondition` occurs on every 25th bar. The direction of the orders changes once every 100 bars, meaning every 100-bar cycle includes *four*[strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) calls with the same direction. For visual reference of the conditions, the script highlights the chart's background based on the current direction each time the `entryCondition` occurs:

![image](images/Strategies-Order-placement-and-cancellation-Strategy-entry-Pyramiding-1.C1FbnbUX_ZfqMKR.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Pyramiding demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Represents the direction of the entry orders. A value of 1 means long, and -1 means short.
var int direction = 1
//@variable Is `true` once every 25 bars, `false` otherwise.
bool entryCondition = bar_index % 25 == 0

// Change the `direction` on every 100th bar.
if bar_index % 100 == 0
    direction *= -1

// Place a market order based on the current `direction` when the `entryCondition` occurs.
if entryCondition
    strategy.entry("Entry", direction == 1 ? strategy.long : strategy.short)

//@variable When the `entryCondition` occurs, is a blue color if the `direction` is 1 and a red color otherwise.
color bgColor = entryCondition ? (direction == 1 ? color.new(color.blue, 80) : color.new(color.red, 80)) : na
// Highlight the chart's background using the `bgColor`. 
bgcolor(bgColor, title = "Background highlight")
```

Notice that although the script calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) with the same direction four times within each 100-bar cycle, the strategy *does not* execute an order after every call. It cannot open more than one trade per position with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) because it uses the default pyramiding value of 1.

Below, we modified the script by including `pyramiding = 4` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement to allow up to four successive trades in the same direction. Now, an order fill occurs after every [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) call:

![image](images/Strategies-Order-placement-and-cancellation-Strategy-entry-Pyramiding-2.CgMebGaG_1nl0aE.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Pyramiding demo", overlay = true, pyramiding = 4)

//@variable Represents the direction of the entry orders. A value of 1 means long, and -1 means short.
var int direction = 1
//@variable Is `true` once every 25 bars, `false` otherwise.
bool entryCondition = bar_index % 25 == 0

// Change the `direction` on every 100th bar.
if bar_index % 100 == 0
    direction *= -1

// Place a market order based on the current `direction` when the `entryCondition` occurs.
if entryCondition
    strategy.entry("Entry", direction == 1 ? strategy.long : strategy.short)

//@variable When the `entryCondition` occurs, is a blue color if the `direction` is 1 and a red color otherwise.
color bgColor = entryCondition ? (direction == 1 ? color.new(color.blue, 80) : color.new(color.red, 80)) : na
// Highlight the chart's background using the `bgColor`. 
bgcolor(bgColor, title = "Background highlight")
```

### [`strategy.order()`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyorder)

The [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) command generates a *basic order*. Unlike other order placement commands, which can behave differently based on a strategy's properties and open trades, this command *ignores* most properties, such as [pyramiding](#pyramiding), and simply creates orders with the specified parameters. This command generates [market orders](#market-orders) by default. It can also create [limit](#limit-orders), [stop](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders), and [stop-limit](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders) orders with the `limit` and `stop` parameters. Orders from [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) can open new positions and modify or close existing ones. When a strategy executes an order from this command, the resulting market position is the *net sum* of the open position and the filled order quantity.

The following script uses [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) calls to enter and exit positions. The strategy places a long [market order](#market-orders) for 15 units once every 100 bars. On every 25th bar that is not a multiple of 100, it places a short market order for five units. The script highlights the background to signify where the strategy places a "buy" or "sell" order:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-3.DSecmQ5U_Zz9mM4.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("`strategy.order()` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar, `false` otherwise.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0
//@variable Is `true` on every 25th bar, `false` otherwise.
bool sellCondition = bar_index % 25 == 0

if buyCondition
    // Place a "buy" market order to trade 15 units in the long direction. 
    strategy.order("buy", strategy.long, qty = 15)
else if sellCondition
    // Place a "sell" market order to trade 5 units in the short direction.
    strategy.order("sell", strategy.short, qty = 5)

// Highlight the background when the `buyCondition` or `sellCondition` occurs.
bgcolor(buyCondition ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : sellCondition ? color.new(color.red, 90) : na)
```

This particular strategy never simulates a *short position*. Unlike the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command, [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order)*does not* automatically [reverse](#reversing-positions) open positions. After filling a "buy" order, the strategy has an open long position of 15 units. The three subsequent "sell" orders *reduce* the position by five units each, and 15 - 5 * 3 = 0. In other words, the strategy opens a long position on every 100th bar and gradually reduces the size to 0 using three successive short orders. If we used [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) instead of the [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) command in this example, the strategy would alternate between entering long and short positions of 15 and five units, respectively.

### [`strategy.exit()`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyexit)

The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command generates *exit orders*. It features several unique behaviors that link to open trades, helping to simplify closing market positions and creating multi-level exits with *take-profit*, *stop-loss*, and *trailing stop* orders.

Unlike other order placement commands, which can generate a *single order* per call, each call to [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) can produce *more than one* type of exit order, depending on its arguments. Additionally, a single call to this command can generate exit orders for *multiple entries*, depending on the specified `from_entry` value and the strategy's open trades.

#### [Take-profit and stop-loss](https://www.tradingview.com#take-profit-and-stop-loss)

The most basic use of the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command is the placement of [limit orders](#limit-orders) to trigger exits after earning enough money (take-profit), [stop orders](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders) to trigger exits after losing too much money (stop-loss), or both (bracket).

Four parameters determine the prices of the command's take-profit and stop-loss orders:

- The `profit` and `loss` parameters accept *relative* values representing the number of *ticks* the market price must move away from the entry price to trigger an exit.
- The `limit` and `stop` parameters accept *absolute* values representing the specific *prices* that trigger an exit when the market price reaches them.

When a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call includes arguments for the relative *and* absolute parameters defining take-profit or stop-loss levels (`profit` and `limit` or `loss` and `stop`), it creates orders only at the levels expected to trigger exits *first*.

For instance, if the `profit` distance is 19 ticks and the `limit` level is 20 ticks past the entry price in the favorable direction, the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command places a take-profit order `profit` ticks past the entry price because the market price will move that distance before reaching the `limit` value. In contrast, if the `profit` distance is 20 ticks and the `limit` level is 19 ticks past the entry price in the favorable direction, the command places a take-profit order at the `limit` level because the price will reach that value first.

The following example creates exit bracket (take-profit and stop-loss) orders with the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command. When the `buyCondition` occurs, the script calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) to place a "buy" [market order](#market-orders). It also calls [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) with `limit` and `stop` arguments to create a take-profit order at the `limitPrice` and a stop-loss order at the `stopPrice`. The script plots the `limitPrice` and `stopPrice` values on the chart to visualize the exit order prices:

![image](images/Strategies-Order-placement-and-cancellation-Strategy-exit-Take-profit-and-stop-loss-1.B0PJXuvg_17dSOG.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Take-profit and stop-loss demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0

//@variable The current take-profit order price. 
var float takeProfit = na
//@variable The current stop-loss order price.
var float stopLoss = na

if buyCondition
    // Update the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` values.
    if strategy.opentrades == 0
        takeProfit := close * 1.01
        stopLoss   := close * 0.99
    // Place a long market order. 
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
    // Place a take-profit order at the `takeProfit` price and a stop-loss order at the `stopLoss` price.
    strategy.exit("exit", "buy", limit = takeProfit, stop = stopLoss)

// Set `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` to `na` when the position closes.
if ta.change(strategy.closedtrades) > 0
    takeProfit := na
    stopLoss   := na

// Plot the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` values.
plot(takeProfit, "TP", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(stopLoss, "SL", color.red, style = plot.style_circles)
```

Note that:

- We did not specify a `qty` or `qty_percent` argument in the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call, meaning it creates orders to exit 100% of the "buy" order's size.
- The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command's exit orders *do not* necessarily execute at the specified prices. Strategies can fill [limit orders](#limit-orders) at *better* prices and [stop orders](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders) at *worse* prices, depending on the range of values available to the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator).

When a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call includes a `from_entry` argument, the resulting exit orders only apply to existing entry orders that have a matching ID. If the specified `from_entry` value does not match the ID of any entry in the current position, the command *does not* create any exit orders.

Below, we changed the `from_entry` argument of the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call in our previous script to "buy2", which means it creates exit orders only for open trades with the "buy2" entry ID. This version does not place *any* exit orders because it does not create any entry orders with the "buy2" ID:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Invalid `from_entry` ID demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0

//@variable The current take-profit order price. 
var float takeProfit = na
//@variable The current stop-loss order price.
var float stopLoss = na

if buyCondition
    // Update the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` values before entering the trade.
    if strategy.opentrades == 0
        takeProfit := close * 1.01
        stopLoss   := close * 0.99
    // Place a long market order. 
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
    // Attempt to place an exit bracket for "buy2" entries.
    // This call has no effect because the strategy does not create entry orders with the "buy2" ID.
    strategy.exit("exit", "buy2", limit = takeProfit, stop = stopLoss)

// Set `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` to `na` when the position closes.
if ta.change(strategy.closedtrades) > 0
    takeProfit := na
    stopLoss   := na

// Plot the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` values.
plot(takeProfit, "TP", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(stopLoss, "SL", color.red, style = plot.style_circles)
```

Note that:

- When a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call *does not* include a `from_entry` argument, it creates exit orders for *all* the position's open trades, regardless of their entry IDs. See the [Exits for multiple entries](#exits-for-multiple-entries) section below to learn more.

#### [Partial and multi-level exits](https://www.tradingview.com#partial-and-multi-level-exits)

Strategies can use more than one call to [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) to create successive *partial* exit orders for the same entry ID, helping to simplify the formation of multi-level exit strategies. To use multiple [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) calls to exit from an open trade, include a `qty` or `qty_percent` argument in each call to specify how much of the traded quantity to close. If the sum of the exit order sizes exceeds the open position, the strategy automatically *reduces* their sizes to match the position.

Note that:

- When a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call includes *both*`qty` and `qty_percent` arguments, the command uses the `qty` value to size the order and ignores the `qty_percent` value.

This example demonstrates a simple strategy that creates two partial exit order brackets for an entry ID. When the `buyCondition` occurs, the script places a "buy" [market order](#market-orders) for two shares with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry), and it creates "exit1" and "exit2" brackets using two calls to [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit). The first call uses a `qty` of 1, and the second uses a `qty` of 3:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-5.WJU0XPdU_11c8yK.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Multi-level exit demo", "test", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0

//@variable The take-profit price for "exit1" orders.
var float takeProfit1 = na
//@variable The take-profit price for "exit2" orders.
var float takeProfit2 = na
//@variable The stop-loss price for "exit1" orders.
var float stopLoss1 = na
//@variable The stop-loss price for "exit2" orders.
var float stopLoss2 = na

if buyCondition
    // Update the `takeProfit*` and `stopLoss*` values before entering the trade.
    if strategy.opentrades == 0
        takeProfit1 := close * 1.01
        takeProfit2 := close * 1.02
        stopLoss1   := close * 0.99
        stopLoss2   := close * 0.98
    // Place a long market order with a `qty` of 2.
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, qty = 2)
    // Place an "exit1" bracket with a `qty` of 1 at the `takeProfit1` and `stopLoss1` prices.
    strategy.exit("exit1", "buy", limit = takeProfit1, stop = stopLoss1, qty = 1)
    // Place an "exit2" bracket with a `qty` of 3 at the `takeProfit1` and `stopLoss1` prices.
    // The size of the resulting orders decreases to match the open position. 
    strategy.exit("exit2", "buy", limit = takeProfit2, stop = stopLoss2, qty = 3)

// Set `takeProfit1` and `stopLoss1` to `na` when the price touches either value. 
if high >= takeProfit1 or low <= stopLoss1
    takeProfit1 := na
    stopLoss1   := na
// Set `takeProfit2` and `stopLoss2` to `na` when the price touches either value. 
if high >= takeProfit2 or low <= stopLoss2
    takeProfit2 := na
    stopLoss2   := na

// Plot the `takeProfit*` and `stopLoss*` values.
plot(takeProfit1, "TP1", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(takeProfit2, "TP2", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(stopLoss1, "SL1", color.red, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(stopLoss2, "SL2", color.red, style = plot.style_circles)
```

As we can see from the trade markers on the chart above, the strategy first executes the "exit1" take-profit or stop-loss order to reduce the open position by one share, leaving one remaining share in the position. However, we specified a size of *three shares* for the "exit2" order bracket, which exceeds the remaining position. Rather than using this specified quantity, the strategy automatically *reduces* the "exit2" orders to one share, allowing it to close the position successfully.

Note that:

- This strategy only fills **one** exit order from the "exit1" bracket, **not both**. When a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call generates more than one exit order type for an entry ID, the strategy fills the only the *first* triggered one and automatically cancels the others.
- The strategy reduced the "exit2" orders because all orders from the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) calls automatically belong to the same [strategy.oca.reduce](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.oca.reduce) group by default. Learn more about [OCA groups](#oca-groups) below.

When creating multiple exit orders with *different*[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) calls, it's crucial to note that the orders from each call *reserve* a portion of the open position. The orders from one [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call *cannot* exit the portion of a position that a previous call already reserved.

For example, this script generates a "buy" entry order for 20 shares with a [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) call and "limit" and "stop" exit orders with two separate calls to [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) 100 bars before the last chart bar. We specified a quantity of 19 shares for the "limit" order and 20 for the "stop" order:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Reserved exit demo", "test", overlay = true)

//@variable The price of the "limit" exit order.
var float limitPrice = na
//@variable The price of the "stop" exit order.
var float stopPrice = na
//@variable Is `true` 100 bars before the last chart bar. 
bool longCondition = last_bar_index - bar_index == 100

if longCondition
    // Update the `limitPrice` and `stopPrice`. 
    limitPrice := close * 1.01
    stopPrice  := close * 0.99
    // Place a long market order for 20 shares.
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, 20)
    // Create a take-profit order for 19 shares at the `limitPrice`.
    strategy.exit("limit", limit = limitPrice, qty = 19)
    // Create a stop-loss order at the `stopPrice`. Although this call specifies a `qty` of 20, the previous 
    // `strategy.exit()` call reserved 19, meaning this call creates an exit order for only 1 share. 
    strategy.exit("stop", stop = stopPrice, qty = 20)

//@variable Is `true` when the strategy has an open position, `false` otherwise.
bool showPlot = strategy.opentrades == 1

// Plot the `limitPrice` and `stopPrice` when `showPlot` is `true`.
plot(showPlot ? limitPrice : na, "Limit (take-profit) price", color.green, 2, plot.style_linebr)
plot(showPlot ? stopPrice : na, "Stop (stop-loss) price", color.red, 2, plot.style_linebr)
```

Users unfamiliar with the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command's unique behaviors might expect this strategy to close the entire market position if it fills the "stop" order before the "limit" order. However, the trade markers in the chart below show that the "stop" order only reduces the position by **one share**. The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call for the "limit" order executes first in the code, reserving 19 shares of the open position for closure with that order. This reservation leaves only one share available for the "stop" order to close, regardless of when the strategy fills it:

#### [Trailing stops](https://www.tradingview.com#trailing-stops)

One of the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command's key features is its ability to create *trailing stops*, i.e., stop-loss orders that trail behind the market price by a specified amount whenever it moves to a better value in the favorable direction (upward for long positions and downward for short positions).

This type of exit order has two components: an *activation level* and a *trail offset*. The activation level is the value the market price must cross to activate the trailing stop calculation, and the trail offset is the distance the activated stop follows behind the price as it reaches successively better values.

Three [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) parameters determine the activation level and trail offset of a trailing stop order:

- The `trail_price` parameter accepts an *absolute price value* for the trailing stop's activation level.
- The `trail_points` parameter is an alternative way to specify the activation level. Its value represents the *tick distance* from the entry price required to activate the trailing stop.
- The `trail_offset` parameter accepts a value representing the order's trail offset as a specified number of ticks.

To create and activate a trailing stop order, a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call must specify a `trail_offset` argument and either a `trail_price` or `trail_points` argument. If the call contains both `trail_price` and `trail_points` arguments, the command uses the level expected to activate the stop *first*. For instance, if the `trail_points` distance is 50 ticks and the `trail_price` value is 51 ticks past the entry price in the favorable direction, the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command uses the `trail_points` value to set the activation level because the market price will move that distance *before* reaching the `trail_price` level.

The example below demonstrates how a trailing stop order works in detail. The strategy places a "Long" [market order](#market-orders) with the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command 100 bars before the last chart bar, and it calls [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) with `trail_price` and `trail_offset` arguments on the following bar to create a trailing stop. The script uses [lines](#lines), [labels](#labels), and a [plot](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) to visualize the trailing stop's behavior.

The green [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) on the chart shows the level the market price must reach to activate the trailing stop order. After the price reaches this level from below, the script uses a blue [plot](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) to display the trailing stop's price. Each time the market price reaches a new high after activating the trailing stop, the stop's price *increases* to maintain a distance of `trailOffsetInput` ticks from the best value. The exit order *does not* change its price level when the price decreases or does not reach a new high. Eventually, the market price crosses below the trailing stop, triggering an exit:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-5b.BprhxxcZ_1ujAyE.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Trailing stop order demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@variable The distance from the entry price required to activate the trailing stop.
int activationOffsetInput = input.int(1000, "Activation level offset (in ticks)", 0)
//@variable The distance the stop follows behind the highest `high` after activation.
int trailOffsetInput = input.int(2000, "Trailing stop offset (in ticks)", 0)

//@variable Draws a label and an optional line at the specified `price`.
debugDrawings(float price, string txt, color drawingColor, bool drawLine = false) =>
    // Draw a label showing the `txt` at the `price` on the current bar.
    label.new(
         bar_index, price, text = txt, color = drawingColor, textcolor = color.white,
         style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
     )
    // Draw a horizontal line at the `price` starting from the current bar when `drawLine` is `true`.
    line.new(
         bar_index, price, bar_index + 1, price, color = drawingColor, extend = extend.right,
         style = line.style_dashed
     )

//@variable The level required to activate the trailing stop.
var float activationLevel = na
//@variable The price of the trailing stop.
var float trailingStop = na
//@variable The value that the trailing stop would have if it was currently active. 
float theoreticalStopPrice = high - trailOffsetInput * syminfo.mintick

// Place a long market order 100 bars before the last historical bar.
if last_bar_index - bar_index == 100
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)

// Create and visualize the exit order on the next bar.
if last_bar_index - bar_index == 99
    // Update the `activationLevel`.
    activationLevel := open + syminfo.mintick * activationOffsetInput
    // Create the trailing stop order that activates at the `activationLevel` and trails behind the `high` by 
    // `trailOffsetInput` ticks. 
    strategy.exit(
         "Trailing Stop", from_entry = "Long", trail_price = activationLevel, 
         trail_offset = trailOffsetInput
     )
    // Create drawings to signify the activation level.
    debugDrawings(activationLevel, "Trailing Stop Activation Level", color.green, true)

// Visualize the trailing stop's levels while the position is open.
if strategy.opentrades == 1
    // Create drawings when the `high` is above the `activationLevel` for the first time to show when the 
    // stop activates. 
    if na(trailingStop) and high >= activationLevel
        debugDrawings(activationLevel, "Activation level crossed", color.green)
        trailingStop := theoreticalStopPrice
        debugDrawings(trailingStop, "Trailing Stop Activated", color.blue)
    // Otherwise, update the `trailingStop` value when the `theoreticalStopPrice` reaches a new high.
    else if theoreticalStopPrice > trailingStop
        trailingStop := theoreticalStopPrice

// Plot the `trailingStop` value to visualize the trailing price movement. 
plot(trailingStop, "Trailing Stop")
```

#### [Exits for multiple entries](https://www.tradingview.com#exits-for-multiple-entries)

A single call to the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command can generate exit orders for *more than one* entry in an open position, depending on the call's `from_entry` value.

If an open position consists of two or more entries with the same ID, a single call to [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) with that ID as the `from_entry` argument places exit orders for each corresponding entry created before or on the bar where the call occurs.

For example, this script periodically calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) on two consecutive bars to enter and add to a long position. Both calls use "buy" as the `id` argument. After creating the second entry, the script calls [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) once with "buy" as its `from_entry` argument to generate separate exit orders for each entry with that ID. When the market price reaches the `takeProfit` or `stopLoss` value, the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills *two* exit orders and closes the position:

![image](images/Strategies-Order-placement-and-cancellation-Strategy-exit-Exits-for-multiple-entries-1.C_bGhVv6_nC4KI.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exits for entries with the same ID demo", overlay = true, pyramiding = 2)

//@variable Take-profit price for exit commands.
var float takeProfit = na
//@variable Stop-loss price for exit commands.
var float stopLoss   = na

//@variable Is `true` on two consecutive bars in 100-bar cycles. 
bool buyCondition = math.min(bar_index % 100, math.max(bar_index - 1, 0) % 100) == 0

if buyCondition
    // Place a "buy" market order to enter a trade. 
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
    // Calculate exits on the second order.
    if strategy.opentrades == 1
        // Update the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss`.
        takeProfit := close * 1.01
        stopLoss   := close * 0.99
        // Place exit orders for both "buy" entries.
        strategy.exit("exit", "buy", limit = takeProfit, stop = stopLoss)

// Set `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` to `na` when both trades close.
if ta.change(strategy.closedtrades) == 2
    takeProfit := na
    stopLoss   := na

// Plot the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` values.
plot(takeProfit, "TP", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(stopLoss, "SL", color.red, style = plot.style_circles)
```

A single [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call can also generate exit orders for *all* entries in an open position, irrespective of entry ID, when it does not include a `from_entry` argument.

Here, we changed the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) instance in the above script to create an entry order with a distinct ID on each call, and we removed the `from_entry` argument from the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call. Since this version does not specify which entries the exit orders apply to, the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call creates orders for *every* entry in the position:

![image](images/Strategies-Order-placement-and-cancellation-Strategy-exit-Exits-for-multiple-entries-2.DSQJLM3u_ZFSCp8.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exits for entries with different IDs demo", overlay = true, pyramiding = 2)

//@variable Take-profit price for exit commands.
var float takeProfit = na
//@variable Stop-loss price for exit commands.
var float stopLoss   = na

//@variable Is `true` on two consecutive bars in 100-bar cycles. 
bool buyCondition = math.min(bar_index % 100, math.max(bar_index - 1, 0) % 100) == 0

if buyCondition
    // Place a long market order with a unique ID. 
    strategy.entry("buy" + str.tostring(strategy.opentrades + strategy.closedtrades), strategy.long)
    // Calculate exits on the second order.
    if strategy.opentrades == 1
        // Update the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss`.
        takeProfit := close * 1.01
        stopLoss   := close * 0.99
        // Place exit orders for ALL entries in the position, irrespective of ID.
        strategy.exit("exit", limit = takeProfit, stop = stopLoss)

// Set `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` to `na` when both trades close.
if ta.change(strategy.closedtrades) == 2
    takeProfit := na
    stopLoss   := na

// Plot the `takeProfit` and `stopLoss` values.
plot(takeProfit, "TP", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(stopLoss, "SL", color.red, style = plot.style_circles)
```

It's crucial to note that a call to [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) without a `from_entry` argument *persists* and creates exit orders for all open trades in a position, regardless of *when* the entries occur. This behavior can affect strategies that manage positions with multiple entries or exits. When a strategy has an open position and calls [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) on any bar without specifying a `from_entry` ID, it generates exit orders for each entry created *before* or on that bar, and it continues to generate exit orders for subsequent entries *after* that bar until the position closes.

Let's explore this behavior and how it works. The script below creates a long entry order with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) on each bar within a user-specified time range, and it calls [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) without a `from_entry` argument on *one bar* within that range to generate exit orders for *every* entry in the open position. The exit command uses a `loss` value of 0, which means an exit order fills each time the market price is not above an entry order's price.

The script prompts users to select three points before it starts its calculations. The first point specifies when order creation begins, the second determines when the single [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call occurs, and the third specifies when order creation stops:

![image](images/Strategies-Order-placement-and-cancellation-Strategy-exit-Exits-for-multiple-entries-3.BViNenRl_RP72m.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exit persist demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100, pyramiding = 100)

//@variable The time when order creation starts. 
int entryStartTime = input.time(0, "Start time for entries", confirm = true)
//@variable The time when the `strategy.exit()` call occurs.
int exitCallTime = input.time(0, "Exit call time", confirm = true)
//@variable The time when order creation stops.
int entryEndTime = input.time(0, "End time for entries", confirm = true)

// Raise a runtime error if incorrect timestamps are chosen.
if exitCallTime <= entryStartTime or entryEndTime <= exitCallTime or entryEndTime <= entryStartTime
    runtime.error("The input timestamps must follow this condition: entryStartTime < exitCallTime < entryEndTime.")

// Create variables to track entry and exit conditions. 
bool entriesStart = time == entryStartTime
bool callExit     = time == exitCallTime
bool entriesEnd   = time == entryEndTime
bool callEntry    = time >= entryStartTime and time < entryEndTime

// Place a long entry order when `callEntry` is `true`.
if callEntry
    strategy.entry("Entry", strategy.long)

// Call `strategy.exit()` when `callExit` is `true`, which occurs only once.
// This single call persists and creates exit orders for EVERY entry in the position because it does not 
// specify a `from_entry` ID.
if callExit
    strategy.exit("Exit", loss = 0)

// Draw labels to signify when entries start, when the `strategy.exit()` call occurs, and when order placement stops.
switch 
    entriesStart => label.new(
         bar_index, high, "Start placing entry orders.", color = color.green, textcolor = color.white, 
         style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
     )
    callExit => label.new(
         bar_index, high, "Call `strategy.exit()` once.", color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, 
         style = label.style_label_lower_right, size = size.large
     )
    entriesEnd => label.new(
         bar_index, high, "Stop placing orders.", color = color.red, textcolor = color.white, 
         style = label.style_label_lower_left, size = size.large
     )

// Create a line and label to visualize the lowest entry price, i.e., the price required to close the position.
var line lowestLine = line.new(
     entryStartTime + 1000, na, entryEndTime, na, xloc.bar_time, extend.right, color.orange, width = 2
 )
var lowestLabel = label.new(
     entryStartTime + 1000, na, "Lowest entry price", color = color.orange, 
     style = label.style_label_upper_right, xloc = xloc.bar_time
 )

// Update the price values of the `lowestLine` and `lowestLabel` after each new entry.
if callEntry[1]
    var float lowestPrice = strategy.opentrades.entry_price(0)
    float entryPrice = strategy.opentrades.entry_price(strategy.opentrades - 1)
    if not na(entryPrice)
        lowestPrice := math.min(lowestPrice, entryPrice)
        lowestLine.set_y1(lowestPrice)
        lowestLine.set_y2(lowestPrice)
        lowestLabel.set_y(lowestPrice)

// Highlight the background when `entriesStart`, `callExit`, and `entriesEnd` occurs.
bgcolor(entriesStart ? color.new(color.green, 80) : na, title = "Entries start highlight")
bgcolor(callExit ? color.new(color.blue, 80) : na, title = "Exit call highlight")
bgcolor(entriesEnd ? color.new(color.red, 80) : na, title = "Entries end highlight")
```

Note that:

- We included `pyramiding = 100` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, which allows the position to have up to 100 open entries from [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry).
- The script uses [labels](#labels) and [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor) to signify when order placement starts and stops and when the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call occurs.
- The script draws a [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) and a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) at the lowest [entry price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.opentrades.entry_price) to show the value the market price must reach to close the position.

We can observe the unique [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) behavior in this example by comparing the code itself with the script's chart outputs. The script calls [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit)*one time*, only on the bar with the blue [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label). However, this single call placed exit orders for every entry **before** or on that bar and continued placing exit orders for all entries **after** that bar. This behavior occurs because [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) has no way to determine when to stop placing orders if it does not link to entries with a specific ID. In this case, the command only ceases to create new exit orders after the position fully closes.

The above script would exhibit different behavior if we included a `from_entry` argument in the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call. When a call to this command specifies a `from_entry` ID, it only applies to entries with that ID which the strategy created *before* or *on* the bar of the call. The command does not place exit orders for subsequent entries created *after* that bar in that case, even ones with the same ID.

Here, we added `from_entry = "Entry"` to our script's [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call, meaning it only produces exit orders for entries with the "Entry" ID. Only 17 exits occur this time, each corresponding to an entry order created before or on the bar with the blue [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label). The call does not affect any entries that the strategy creates *after* that bar:

### [`strategy.close()` and `strategy.close_all()`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyclose-and-strategyclose_all)

The [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) and [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) commands generate orders to exit from an open position. Unlike [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit), which creates *price-based* exit orders (e.g., [stop-loss](#take-profit-and-stop-loss)), these commands generate [market orders](#market-orders) that the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills on the next available tick, irrespective of the price.

The example below demonstrates a simple strategy that places a "buy" entry order with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) once every 50 bars and a [market order](#market-orders) to close the long position with [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) 25 bars afterward:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-6.C8naMrYK_ZahHab.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Close demo", "test", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` on every 50th bar.
buyCond = bar_index % 50 == 0
//@variable Is `true` on every 25th bar except for those that are divisible by 50.
sellCond = bar_index % 25 == 0 and not buyCond

if buyCond
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
if sellCond
    strategy.close("buy")

bgcolor(buyCond  ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : na)
bgcolor(sellCond ? color.new(color.red, 90) : na)
```

Notice that the [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) call in this script uses "buy" as its required `id` argument. Unlike [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit), this command's `id` parameter specifies the *entry ID* of an open trade. It **does not** represent the ID of the resulting exit order. If a market position consists of multiple open trades with the same entry ID, a single [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) call with that ID as its `id` argument generates a single [market order](#market-orders) to exit from all of them.

The following script creates a "buy" order with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) once every 25 bars, and it calls [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) with "buy" as its `id` argument to close all open trades with that entry ID once every 100 bars. The market order from [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) closes the entire position in this case because every open trade has the same "buy" entry ID:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-7.BnXt0DwI_2ljg1Q.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Multiple close demo", "test", overlay = true, pyramiding = 3)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
sellCond = bar_index % 100 == 0
//@variable Is `true` on every 25th bar except for those that are divisible by 100.
buyCond = bar_index % 25 == 0 and not sellCond

if buyCond
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
if sellCond
    strategy.close("buy")

bgcolor(buyCond  ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : na)
bgcolor(sellCond ? color.new(color.red, 90) : na)
```

Note that:

- We included `pyramiding = 3` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, allowing the script to generate up to three entries per position with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) calls.

The [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) command generates a [market order](#market-orders) to exit from the open position that *does not* link to any specific entry ID. This command is helpful when a strategy needs to exit as soon as possible from a position consisting of multiple open trades with different entry IDs.

The script below places "A", "B", and "C" entry orders sequentially based on the number of [open trades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.opentrades), and then it calls [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) to create a single order that closes the entire position on the next bar:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-8.CRIv7OvG_1rGwwH.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Close multiple ID demo", "test", overlay = true, pyramiding = 3)

switch strategy.opentrades
    0 => strategy.entry("A", strategy.long)
    1 => strategy.entry("B", strategy.long)
    2 => strategy.entry("C", strategy.long)
    3 => strategy.close_all()
```

### [`strategy.cancel()` and `strategy.cancel_all()`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategycancel-and-strategycancel_all)

The [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel) and [strategy.cancel_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel_all) commands allow strategies to cancel *unfilled* orders before the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) processes them. These order cancellation commands are most helpful when working with *price-based orders*, including all orders from [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) calls and the orders from [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) and [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) calls that use `limit` or `stop` arguments.

The [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel) command has a required `id` parameter, which specifies the ID of the entry or exit orders to cancel. The [strategy.cancel_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel_all) command does not have such a parameter because it cancels *all* unfilled orders, regardless of ID.

The following strategy places a "buy" [limit order](#limit-orders) 500 ticks below the closing price 100 bars before the last chart bar with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry), and it cancels the order on the next bar with [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel). The script highlights the chart's background to signify when it places and cancels the "buy" order, and it draws a horizontal [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line) at the order's price. As we see below, our example chart shows no entry marker when the market price crosses the horizontal line because the strategy already cancels the order (when the chart's background is orange) before it reaches that level:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-9.4WRZcmod_TgLp6.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Cancel demo", "test", overlay = true)

//@variable Draws a horizontal line at the `limit` price of the "buy" order.
var line limitLine = na

//@variable Is `color.green` when the strategy places the "buy" order, `color.orange` when it cancels the order.
color bgColor = na

if last_bar_index - bar_index == 100
    float limitPrice = close - syminfo.mintick * 500
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, limit = limitPrice)
    limitLine := line.new(bar_index, limitPrice, bar_index + 1, limitPrice, extend = extend.right)
    bgColor := color.new(color.green, 50)

if last_bar_index - bar_index == 99
    strategy.cancel("buy")
    bgColor := color.new(color.orange, 50)

bgcolor(bgColor)
```

The [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel) command affects *all* unfilled orders with a specified ID. It does nothing if the specified `id` represents the ID of an order that does not exist. When there is more than one unfilled order with the specified ID, the command cancels *all* of them at once.

Below, we've modified the previous script to place a "buy" limit order on three consecutive bars, starting 100 bars before the last chart bar. After placing all three orders, the strategy cancels them using [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel) with "buy" as the `id` argument, resulting in nothing happening when the market price reaches any of the order prices (horizontal [lines](#lines)):

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-10.BdK1xjss_Z1VR5ov.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Multiple cancel demo", "test", overlay = true, pyramiding = 3)

//@variable Draws a horizontal line at the `limit` price of the "buy" order.
var line limitLine = na

//@variable Is `color.green` when the strategy places the "buy" order, `color.orange` when it cancels the order.
color bgColor = na

if last_bar_index - bar_index <= 100 and last_bar_index - bar_index >= 98
    float limitPrice = close - syminfo.mintick * 500
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, limit = limitPrice)
    limitLine := line.new(bar_index, limitPrice, bar_index + 1, limitPrice, extend = extend.right)
    bgColor := color.new(color.green, 50)

if last_bar_index - bar_index == 97
    strategy.cancel("buy")
    bgColor := color.new(color.orange, 50)

bgcolor(bgColor)
```

Note that:

- We included `pyramiding = 3` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, allowing three successive entries from [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) per position. The script would also achieve the same result without this setting if it called [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) instead because [pyramiding](#pyramiding)*does not* affect orders from that command.

The [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel) and [strategy.cancel_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel_all) commands can cancel orders of any type, including [market orders](#market-orders). However, it is important to note that either command can cancel a market order only if its call occurs on the *same* script execution as the order placement command. If the call happens after that point, it has *no effect* because the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills market orders on the *next available tick*.

This example places a "buy" market order 100 bars before the last chart bar with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry), then it attempts to cancel the order on the next bar with [strategy.cancel_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel_all). The cancellation command *does not* affect the "buy" order because the broker emulator fills the order on the next bar's *opening tick*, which occurs *before* the script evaluates the [strategy.cancel_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel_all) call:

![image](images/Strategies-Orders-and-entries-Order-placement-commands-11.C3U1GI3M_DIxpi.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Cancel market demo", "test", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `color.green` when the strategy places the "buy" order, `color.orange` when it tries to cancel the order.
color bgColor = na

if last_bar_index - bar_index == 100
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
    bgColor := color.new(color.green, 50)

if last_bar_index - bar_index == 99
    strategy.cancel_all()
    bgColor := color.new(color.orange, 50)

bgcolor(bgColor)
```

## [Position sizing](https://www.tradingview.com#position-sizing)

Pine Script™ strategies feature two ways to control the sizes of the orders that open and manage positions:

- Set a default *fixed* quantity type and value for the orders. Programmers can specify defaults for these properties by including `default_qty_type` and `default_qty_value` arguments in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement. Script users can adjust these values with the "Order size" inputs in the "Settings/Properties" tab.
- Include a *non-na*`qty` argument in the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) or [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) call. When a call to either of these commands specifies a non-na `qty` value, that call ignores the strategy's default quantity type and value and places an order for `qty` contracts/shares/lots/units instead.

The following example uses [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) calls with different `qty` values for long and short trades. When the current bar's [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) equals the `lowest` value, the script places a "Buy" order to enter a long position of `longAmount` units. Otherwise, when the [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) equals the `highest` value, it places a "Sell" order to enter a short position of `shortAmount` units:

![image](images/Strategies-Position-sizing-1.CpMYvl8Y_ZCp8n6.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Buy low, sell high", overlay = true, default_qty_type = strategy.cash, default_qty_value = 5000)

int   length      = input.int(20, "Length", 1)
float longAmount  = input.float(4.0, "Long Amount", 0.0)
float shortAmount = input.float(2.0, "Short Amount", 0.0)

float highest = ta.highest(length)
float lowest  = ta.lowest(length)

switch
    low == lowest   => strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, longAmount)
    high == highest => strategy.entry("Sell", strategy.short, shortAmount)
```

Notice that although we've included `default_qty_type` and `default_qty_value` arguments in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, the strategy *does not* use this default setting to size its orders because the specified `qty` in the entry commands takes precedence. If we want to use the default size, we must *remove* the `qty` arguments from the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) calls or set their values to [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

Here, we edited the previous script by including [ternary](#-ternary-operator) expressions for the `qty` arguments in both [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) calls that replace input values of 0 with [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na). If the specified `longAmount` or `shortAmount` is 0, which is what we set as the new default, the corresponding entry orders use the strategy's default order size instead, as we see below:

![image](images/Strategies-Position-sizing-2.BNMrWxCG_Z1eMhKJ.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Buy low, sell high", overlay = true, default_qty_type = strategy.cash, default_qty_value = 5000)

int   length      = input.int(20, "Length", 1)
float longAmount  = input.float(0.0, "Long Amount", 0.0)
float shortAmount = input.float(0.0, "Short Amount", 0.0)

float highest = ta.highest(length)
float lowest  = ta.lowest(length)

switch
    low == lowest   => strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, longAmount == 0.0 ? na : longAmount)
    high == highest => strategy.entry("Sell", strategy.short, shortAmount == 0.0 ? na : shortAmount)
```

## [Closing a market position](https://www.tradingview.com#closing-a-market-position)

By default, strategies close a market position using the *First In, First Out (FIFO)* method, which means that any exit order closes or reduces the position starting with the *first* open trade, even if the exit command specifies the entry ID of a *different* open trade. To override this default behavior, include `close_entries_rule = "ANY"` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement.

The following example places "Buy1" and "Buy2" entry orders sequentially, starting 100 bars before the latest chart bar. When the position size is 0, it calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) to place the "Buy1" order for five units. After the strategy's position size matches the size of that order, it uses [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) to place the "Buy2" order for ten units. The strategy then creates "bracket" exit orders [for both entries](#exits-for-multiple-entries) using a single [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call without a `from_entry` argument. For visual reference, the script plots the [strategy.position_size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_size) value in a separate pane:

![image](images/Strategies-Closing-a-market-position-1.CG44yAVx_1GNd4G.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exit Demo", pyramiding = 2)

float positionSize = strategy.position_size

if positionSize == 0 and last_bar_index - bar_index <= 100
    strategy.entry("Buy1", strategy.long, 5)
else if positionSize == 5
    strategy.entry("Buy2", strategy.long, 10)
else if positionSize == 15
    strategy.exit("bracket", loss = 10, profit = 10)

plot(positionSize == 0 ? na : positionSize, "Position Size", color.lime, 4, plot.style_histogram)
```

Note that:

- We included `pyramiding = 2` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, allowing two successive entries from [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) per position.

Each time the market price triggers an exit order, the above script exits from the open position, starting with the *oldest* open trade. This FIFO behavior applies even if we explicitly specify an exit from "Buy2" before "Buy1" in the code.

The script version below calls [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) with "Buy2" as its `id` argument, and it includes "Buy1" as the `from_entry` argument in the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call. The [market order](#market-orders) from [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) executes on the next available tick, meaning the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills it *before* the [take-profit](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) and [stop-loss](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) orders from [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit):

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exit Demo", pyramiding = 2)

float positionSize = strategy.position_size

if positionSize == 0 and last_bar_index - bar_index <= 100
    strategy.entry("Buy1", strategy.long, 5)
else if positionSize == 5
    strategy.entry("Buy2", strategy.long, 10)
else if positionSize == 15
    strategy.close("Buy2")
    strategy.exit("bracket", "Buy1", loss = 10, profit = 10)

plot(positionSize == 0 ? na : positionSize, "Position Size", color.lime, 4, plot.style_histogram)
```

The market order from the script's [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) call is for 10 units because it links to the open trade with the "Buy2" entry ID. A user might expect this strategy to close that trade completely when the order executes. However, the "List of Trades" tab shows that five units of the order go toward closing the "Buy1" trade *first* because it is the oldest, and the remaining five units close *half* of the "Buy2" trade. After that, the "bracket" orders from the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call close the rest of the position:

![image](images/Strategies-Closing-a-market-position-2.tTsJ7OdZ_Z2rHJes.png)

Note that:

- If we included `close_entries_rule = "ANY"` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, the market order from [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) would close the open trade with the "Buy2" entry ID *first*, and then the "bracket" orders from [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) would close the trade with the "Buy1" entry ID.

## [OCA groups](https://www.tradingview.com#oca-groups)

*One-Cancels-All (OCA)* groups allow a strategy to fully or partially *cancel* specific orders when the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) executes another order from the same group. To assign an order to an OCA group, include an `oca_name` argument in the call to the [order placement command](#order-placement-and-cancellation). The [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) and [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) commands also allow programmers to specify an *OCA type*, which defines whether a strategy [cancels](#strategyocacancel), [reduces](#strategyocareduce), or [does not modify](#strategyocanone) the order after executing other orders.

### [`strategy.oca.cancel`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyocacancel)

When an order placement command uses [strategy.oca.cancel](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.oca.cancel) as its `oca_type` argument, the strategy completely *cancels* the resulting order if another order from the same OCA group executes first.

To demonstrate how this OCA type impacts a strategy's orders, consider the following script, which places orders when the `ma1` value crosses the `ma2` value. If the [strategy.position_size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_size) is 0 when the cross occurs, the strategy places two [stop orders](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders) with [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) calls. The first is a long order at the bar's [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), and the second is a short order at the bar's [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low). If the strategy already has an open position during the cross, it calls [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) to close the position with a [market order](#market-orders):

```
//@version=6
strategy("OCA Cancel Demo", overlay=true)

float ma1 = ta.sma(close, 5)
float ma2 = ta.sma(close, 9)

if ta.cross(ma1, ma2)
    if strategy.position_size == 0
        strategy.order("Long",  strategy.long, stop = high)
        strategy.order("Short", strategy.short, stop = low)
    else
        strategy.close_all()

plot(ma1, "Fast MA", color.aqua)
plot(ma2, "Slow MA", color.orange)
```

Depending on the price action, the strategy might fill *both* stop orders before creating the closing market order. In that case, the strategy exits the position without evaluating [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) because both orders have the same size. We see this behavior in the chart below, where the strategy alternated between executing "Long" and "Short" orders a few times without executing an order from [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all):

![image](images/Strategies-OCA-groups-Strategy-oca-cancel-1.B4pkrsRw_1KFx5x.png)

To eliminate scenarios where the strategy fills the "Long" and "Short" orders before evaluating the [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) call, we can instruct it to *cancel* one of the orders after it executes the other. Below, we included "Entry" as the `oca_name` argument and [strategy.oca.cancel](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.oca.cancel) as the `oca_type` argument in both [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) calls. Now, after the strategy executes either the "Long" or "Short" order, it cancels the other order and waits for [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) to close the position:

![image](images/Strategies-OCA-groups-Strategy-oca-cancel-2.Pw0HBDfm_ZLEEMG.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("OCA Cancel Demo", overlay=true)

float ma1 = ta.sma(close, 5)
float ma2 = ta.sma(close, 9)

if ta.cross(ma1, ma2)
    if strategy.position_size == 0
        strategy.order("Long",  strategy.long, stop = high, oca_name = "Entry", oca_type = strategy.oca.cancel)
        strategy.order("Short", strategy.short, stop = low, oca_name = "Entry", oca_type = strategy.oca.cancel)
    else
        strategy.close_all()

plot(ma1, "Fast MA", color.aqua)
plot(ma2, "Slow MA", color.orange)
```

### [`strategy.oca.reduce`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyocareduce)

When an order placement command uses [strategy.oca.reduce](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.oca.reduce) as its OCA type, the strategy *does not* cancel the resulting order entirely if another order with the same OCA name executes first. Instead, it *reduces* the order's size by the filled number of contracts/shares/lots/units, which is particularly useful for custom exit strategies.

The following example demonstrates a *long-only* strategy that generates a single stop-loss order and two take-profit orders for each new entry. When a faster moving average crosses over a slower one, the script calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) with `qty = 6` to create an entry order, and then it uses three [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) calls to create a [stop order](#stop-and-stop-limit-orders) at the `stop` price and two [limit orders](#limit-orders) at the `limit1` and `limit2` prices. The [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) call for the "Stop" order uses `qty = 6`, and the two calls for the "Limit 1" and "Limit 2" orders both use `qty = 3`:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Multiple TP Demo", overlay = true)

var float stop   = na
var float limit1 = na
var float limit2 = na

bool longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 5), ta.sma(close, 9))
if longCondition and strategy.position_size == 0
    stop   := close * 0.99
    limit1 := close * 1.01
    limit2 := close * 1.02
    strategy.entry("Long",  strategy.long, 6)
    strategy.order("Stop",  strategy.short, stop = stop, qty = 6)
    strategy.order("Limit 1", strategy.short, limit = limit1, qty = 3)
    strategy.order("Limit 2", strategy.short, limit = limit2, qty = 3)

bool showPlot = strategy.position_size != 0
plot(showPlot ? stop   : na, "Stop",    color.red,   style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(showPlot ? limit1 : na, "Limit 1", color.green, style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(showPlot ? limit2 : na, "Limit 2", color.green, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

After adding this strategy to the chart, we see it does not work as initially intended. The problem with this script is that the orders from [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order)**do not** belong to an OCA group by default (unlike [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit), whose orders automatically belong to a [strategy.oca.reduce](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.oca.reduce) OCA group). Since the strategy does not assign the [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) calls to any OCA group, it does not reduce any unfilled stop or limit orders after executing an order. Consequently, if the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills the stop order and at least one of the limit orders, the traded quantity **exceeds** the open long position, resulting in an open *short* position:

![image](images/Strategies-OCA-groups-Strategy-oca-reduce-1.B8XPX6-M_ZmN4JH.png)

For our long-only strategy to work as we intended, we must instruct it to *reduce* the sizes of the unfilled stop/limit orders after one of them executes to prevent selling a larger quantity than the open long position.

Below, we specified "Bracket" as the `oca_name` and [strategy.oca.reduce](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.oca.reduce) as the `oca_type` in all the script's [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) calls. These changes tell the strategy to reduce the sizes of the orders in the "Bracket" group each time the broker emulator fills one of them. This version of the strategy never simulates a short position because the total size of its filled stop and limit orders never *exceeds* the long position's size:

![image](images/Strategies-OCA-groups-Strategy-oca-reduce-2.C2FZumhg_1kQ60w.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Multiple TP Demo", overlay = true)

var float stop   = na
var float limit1 = na
var float limit2 = na

bool longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 5), ta.sma(close, 9))
if longCondition and strategy.position_size == 0
    stop   := close * 0.99
    limit1 := close * 1.01
    limit2 := close * 1.02
    strategy.entry("Long",  strategy.long, 6)
    strategy.order("Stop",  strategy.short, stop = stop, qty = 6, oca_name = "Bracket", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce)
    strategy.order("Limit 1", strategy.short, limit = limit1, qty = 3, oca_name = "Bracket", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce)
    strategy.order("Limit 2", strategy.short, limit = limit2, qty = 6, oca_name = "Bracket", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce)

bool showPlot = strategy.position_size != 0
plot(showPlot ? stop   : na, "Stop",    color.red,   style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(showPlot ? limit1 : na, "Limit 1", color.green, style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(showPlot ? limit2 : na, "Limit 2", color.green, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

Note that:

- We also changed the `qty` value of the "Limit 2" order to 6 instead of 3 because the strategy reduces its amount by three units when it executes the "Limit 1" order. Keeping the `qty` value of 3 would cause the second limit order's size to drop to 0 after the strategy fills the first limit order, meaning it would never execute.

### [`strategy.oca.none`](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyocanone)

When an order placement command uses [strategy.oca.none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.oca.none) as its `oca_type` value, all orders from that command execute *independently* of any OCA group. This value is the default `oca_type` for the [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) and [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) commands.

## [Currency](https://www.tradingview.com#currency)

Pine Script™ strategies can use different currencies in their calculations than the instruments they simulate trades on. Programmers can specify a strategy's [account currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.account_currency) by including a `currency.*` variable as the `currency` argument in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement. The default value is [currency.NONE](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_currency.NONE), meaning the strategy uses the same currency as the current chart ([syminfo.currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.currency)). Script users can change the account currency using the "Base currency" input in the script's "Settings/Properties" tab.

When a strategy script uses an account currency that differs from the chart's currency, it uses the *previous daily value* of a corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange to determine the conversion rate. If no exchange provides the rate directly, it derives the rate using a [spread symbol](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502298-spread-charts/). The strategy multiplies all monetary values, including simulated profits/losses, by the determined cross rate to express them in the account currency. To retrieve the rate that a strategy uses to convert monetary values, call [request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate) with [syminfo.currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.currency) as the `from` argument and [strategy.account_currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.account_currency) as the `to` argument.

Note that:

- Programmers can directly convert values expressed in a strategy's account currency to the chart's currency and vice versa via the [strategy.convert_to_symbol()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.convert_to_symbol) and [strategy.convert_to_account()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.convert_to_account) functions.

The following example demonstrates how currency conversion affects a strategy's monetary values and how a strategy's cross-rate calculations match those that `request.*()` functions use.

On each of the latest 500 bars, the strategy places an entry order with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry), and it places a [take-profit](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) and [stop-loss](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) order one tick away from the entry price with [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit). The size of each entry order is `1.0 / syminfo.mintick`, rounded to the nearest tick, which means that the profit/loss of each closed trade is equal to *one point* in the chart's *quote currency*. We specified [currency.EUR](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_currency.EUR) as the account currency in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, meaning the strategy multiplies all monetary values by a cross rate to express them in Euros.

The script calculates the absolute change in the ratio of the strategy's [net profit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.netprofit) to the symbol's [point value](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.pointvalue) to determine the value of *one unit* of the chart's currency in Euros. It plots this value alongside the result from a [request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate) call that uses [syminfo.currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.currency) and [strategy.account_currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.account_currency) as the `from` and `to` arguments. As we see below, both plots align, confirming that strategies and `request.*()` functions use the *same* daily cross-rate calculations:

![image](images/Strategies-Currency-1.BIrX-27H_1pt4ls.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Currency Test", currency = currency.EUR)

if last_bar_index - bar_index < 500
    // Place an entry order with a size that results in a P/L of `syminfo.pointvalue` units of chart currency per tick. 
    strategy.entry("LE", strategy.long, math.round_to_mintick(1.0 / syminfo.mintick))
    // Place exit orders one tick above and below the "LE" entry price, 
    // meaning each trade closes with one point of profit or loss in the chart's currency.
    strategy.exit("LX", "LE", profit = 1, loss = 1)

// Plot the absolute change in `strategy.netprofit / syminfo.pointvalue`, which represents 1 chart unit of profit/loss. 
plot(
     math.abs(ta.change(strategy.netprofit / syminfo.pointvalue)), "1 chart unit of profit/loss in EUR", 
     color = color.fuchsia, linewidth = 4
 )
// Plot the requested currency rate.
plot(request.currency_rate(syminfo.currency, strategy.account_currency), "Requested conversion rate", color.lime)
```

Note that:

- When a strategy executes on a chart with a timeframe higher than "1D", it uses the data from *one day before* each *historical* bar's closing time for its cross-rate calculations. For example, on a "1W" chart, the strategy bases its cross rate on the previous Thursday's closing values. However, it still uses the latest confirmed daily rate on *realtime* bars.

## [Altering calculation behavior](https://www.tradingview.com#altering-calculation-behavior)

Strategy scripts execute across all available historical chart bars and continue to execute on realtime bars as new data comes in. However, by default, strategies only recalculate their values after a bar *closes*, even on realtime bars, and the earliest point that the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills the orders a strategy places on the close one bar is at the *open* of the following bar.

Users can change these behaviors with the `calc_on_every_tick`, `calc_on_order_fills`, and `process_orders_on_close` parameters of the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement or the corresponding inputs in the "Recalculate" and "Fill orders" sections of the script's "Settings/Properties" tab. The sections below explain how these settings affect a strategy's calculations.

### [`calc_on_every_tick`](https://www.tradingview.com#calc_on_every_tick)

The `calc_on_every_tick` parameter of the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function determines the frequency of a strategy's calculations on *realtime bars*. When this parameter's value is `true`, the script recalculates on each *new tick* in the realtime data feed. Its default value is `false`, meaning the script only executes on a realtime bar after it closes. Users can also toggle this recalculation behavior with the "On every tick" input in the script's "Settings/Properties" tab.

Enabling this setting can be useful in forward testing because it allows a strategy to use realtime price updates in its calculations. However, it *does not* affect the calculations on historical bars because historical data feeds *do not* contain complete tick data: the broker emulator considers each historical bar to have only four ticks (open, high, low, and close). Therefore, users should exercise caution and understand the limitations of this setting. If enabling calculation on every tick causes a strategy to behave *differently* on historical and realtime bars, the strategy will **[repaint](#repainting)** after the user reloads it.

The following example demonstrates how recalculation on every tick can cause strategy repainting. The script uses [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) calls to place a long entry order each time the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) reaches its `highest` value and a short entry order each time the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) reaches its `lowest` value. The [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement includes `calc_on_every_tick = true`, meaning that on realtime bars, it can recalculate and place orders on new price updates *before* a bar closes:

```
//@version=6
strategy("Donchian Channel Break", overlay = true, calc_on_every_tick = true, pyramiding = 20)

int length = input.int(15, "Length")

float highest = ta.highest(close, length)
float lowest  = ta.lowest(close, length)

if close == highest
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)
if close == lowest
    strategy.entry("Sell", strategy.short)

// Highlight the background of realtime bars.
bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 80) : na)

plot(highest, "Highest", color = color.lime)
plot(lowest, "Lowest", color = color.red)
```

Note that:

- The script uses a [pyramiding](#pyramiding) value of 20, allowing it to simulate up to 20 entries per position with the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) command.
- The script highlights the chart's background orange when [barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isrealtime) is `true` to indicate realtime bars.

After applying the script to our chart and letting it run on several realtime bars, we see the following output:

![image](images/Strategies-Altering-calculation-behavior-Calc-on-every-tick-1.BX0Fex4v_2vXWeQ.png)

The script placed a "Buy" order on *each tick* where the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) was at the `highest` value, which happened *more than once* on each realtime bar. Additionally, the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) filled each [market order](#market-orders) at the current realtime price rather than strictly at the open of the following chart bar.

After we reload the chart, we see that the strategy *changed* its behavior and *repainted* its results on those bars. This time, the strategy placed only *one* "Buy" order for each *closed bar* where the condition was valid, and the broker emulator filled each order at the open of the following bar. It did not generate multiple entries per bar because what were previously realtime bars became *historical* bars, which **do not** hold complete tick data:

![image](images/Strategies-Altering-calculation-behavior-Calc-on-every-tick-2.CEEZdx06_1CeGHx.png)

### [`calc_on_order_fills`](https://www.tradingview.com#calc_on_order_fills)

The `calc_on_order_fills` parameter of the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function enables a strategy to recalculate immediately after an *order fills*, allowing it to use more granular information and place additional orders without waiting for a bar to close. Its default value is `false`, meaning the strategy does not allow recalculation immediately after every order fill. Users can also toggle this behavior with the "After order is filled" input in the script's "Settings/Properties" tab.

Enabling this setting can provide a strategy script with additional data that would otherwise not be available until after a bar closes, such as the current average price of a simulated position on an open bar.

The example below shows a simple strategy that creates a "Buy" order with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) whenever the [strategy.position_size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_size) is 0. The script uses [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price) to calculate price levels for the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call's stop-loss and take-profit orders that close the position.

We've included `calc_on_order_fills = true` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, meaning that the strategy recalculates each time the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills a "Buy" or "Exit" order. Each time an "Exit" order fills, the [strategy.position_size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_size) reverts to 0, triggering a new "Buy" order. The broker emulator fills the "Buy" order on the next tick at one of the bar's OHLC values, and then the strategy uses the recalculated [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price) value to determine new "Exit" order prices:

![image](images/Strategies-Altering-calculation-behavior-Calc-on-order-fills-1.TfUCX8p2_7gwAM.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Intrabar exit", overlay = true, calc_on_order_fills = true)

float stopSize   = input.float(5.0, "SL %", minval = 0.0) / 100.0
float profitSize = input.float(5.0, "TP %", minval = 0.0) / 100.0

if strategy.position_size == 0.0
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)

float stopLoss   = strategy.position_avg_price * (1.0 - stopSize)
float takeProfit = strategy.position_avg_price * (1.0 + profitSize)

strategy.exit("Exit", stop = stopLoss, limit = takeProfit)
```

Note that:

- Without enabling recalculation on order fills, this strategy would not place new orders *before* a bar closes. After an exit, the strategy would wait for the bar to close before placing a new "Buy" order, which the broker emulator would fill on the *next tick* after that, i.e., the open of the following bar.

It's important to note that enabling `calc_on_order_fills` can produce unrealistic strategy results in some cases because the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) may assume order-fill prices that are *not* obtainable in real-world trading. Therefore, users should exercise caution and carefully examine their strategy logic when allowing recalculation on order fills.

For example, the following script places a "Buy" order after each new order fill and bar close over the most recent 25 historical bars. The strategy simulates *four* entries per bar because the broker emulator considers each historical bar to have *four ticks* (open, high, low, and close). This behavior is unrealistic because it is not typically possible to fill an order at a bar's *exact* high or low price:

![image](images/Strategies-Altering-calculation-behavior-Calc-on-order-fills-2.vGEDeBsL_1sBc2Q.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("buy on every fill", overlay = true, calc_on_order_fills = true, pyramiding = 100)

if last_bar_index - bar_index <= 25
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)
```

### [`process_orders_on_close`](https://www.tradingview.com#process_orders_on_close)

By default, strategies simulate orders at the close of each bar, meaning that the earliest opportunity to fill the orders and execute strategy calculations and alerts is on the opening of the following bar. Programmers can change this behavior to process orders on the *closing tick* of each bar by setting `process_orders_on_close` to `true` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement. Users can set this behavior by changing the "Fill Orders/On Bar Close" setting in the "Settings/Properties" tab.

This behavior is most useful when backtesting manual strategies in which traders exit from a position before a bar closes, or in scenarios where algorithmic traders in non-24x7 markets set up after-hours trading capability so that alerts sent after close still have hope of filling before the following day.

Note that:

- Using strategies with `process_orders_on_close` enabled to send alerts to a third-party service might cause unintended results. Alerts on the close of a bar still occur after the market closes, and real-world orders based on such alerts might not fill until after the market opens again.
- The [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) and [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) commands feature an `immediately` parameter that, if `true`, allows the resulting market order to fill on the same tick where the strategy created it. This parameter provides an alternative way for programmers to selectively apply `process_orders_on_close` behavior to closing market orders without affecting the behavior of other order placement commands.

## [Simulating trading costs](https://www.tradingview.com#simulating-trading-costs)

Strategy performance reports are more relevant and meaningful when they include potential real-world trading costs. Without modeling the potential costs associated with their trades, traders may overestimate a strategy's historical profitability, potentially leading to suboptimal decisions in live trading. Pine Script™ strategies include inputs and parameters for simulating trading costs in performance results.

### [Commission](https://www.tradingview.com#commission)

Commission is the fee a broker/exchange charges when executing trades. Commission can be a flat fee per trade or contract/share/lot/unit, or a percentage of the total transaction value. Users can set the commission properties of their strategies by including `commission_type` and `commission_value` arguments in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function, or by setting the "Commission" inputs in the "Properties" tab of the strategy settings.

The following script is a simple strategy that simulates a "Long" position of 2% of equity when `close` equals the `highest` value over the `length`, and closes the trade when it equals the `lowest` value:

![image](images/Strategies-Simulating-trading-costs-Commission-1.XUDZaoNR_2iKnnJ.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Commission Demo", overlay=true, default_qty_value = 2, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity)

length = input.int(10, "Length")

float highest = ta.highest(close, length)
float lowest  = ta.lowest(close, length)

switch close
    highest => strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)

plot(lowest, color = color.new(color.red, 50))
```

The results in the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) show that the strategy had a positive equity growth of 17.61% over the testing range. However, the backtest results do not account for fees the broker/exchange may charge. Let's see what happens to these results when we include a small commission on every trade in the strategy simulation. In this example, we've included `commission_type = strategy.commission.percent` and `commission_value = 1` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration, meaning it will simulate a commission of 1% on all executed orders:

![image](images/Strategies-Simulating-trading-costs-Commission-2.DAdgHUnC_4hzO7.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy(
     "Commission Demo", overlay=true, default_qty_value = 2, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity,
     commission_type = strategy.commission.percent, commission_value = 1
 )

length = input.int(10, "Length")

float highest = ta.highest(close, length)
float lowest  = ta.lowest(close, length)

switch close
    highest => strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
    lowest  => strategy.close("Long")

plot(highest, color = color.new(color.lime, 50))
plot(lowest, color = color.new(color.red, 50))
```

As we can see in the example above, after applying a 1% commission to the backtest, the strategy simulated a significantly reduced net profit of only 1.42% and a more volatile equity curve with an elevated max drawdown. These results highlight the impact that commission can have on a strategy's hypothetical performance.

### [Slippage and unfilled limits](https://www.tradingview.com#slippage-and-unfilled-limits)

In real-life trading, a broker/exchange may fill orders at slightly different prices than a trader intended, due to volatility, liquidity, order size, and other market factors, which can profoundly impact a strategy's performance. The disparity between expected prices and the actual prices at which the broker/exchange executes trades is what we refer to as *slippage*. Slippage is dynamic and unpredictable, making it impossible to simulate precisely. However, factoring in a small amount of slippage on each trade during a backtest or forward test might help the results better align with reality. Users can model slippage in their strategy results, sized as a fixed number of *ticks*, by including a `slippage` argument in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement or by setting the "Slippage" input in the "Settings/Properties" tab.

The following example demonstrates how simulating slippage affects the fill prices of [market orders](#market-orders) in a strategy test. The script below places a "Buy" market order of 2% equity when the market price is above a rising EMA and closes the position when the price dips below the EMA while it's falling. We've included `slippage = 20` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function, which declares that the price of each simulated order will slip 20 ticks in the direction of the trade.

The script uses [strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dentry_bar_index) and [strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dexit_bar_index) to get the `entryIndex` and `exitIndex`, which it uses to obtain the `fillPrice` of the order. When the bar index is at the `entryIndex`, the `fillPrice` is the first [strategy.opentrades.entry_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dentry_price) value. At the `exitIndex`, `fillPrice` is the [strategy.closedtrades.exit_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dexit_price) value from the last closed trade. The script plots the expected fill price along with the simulated fill price after slippage to visually compare the difference:

![image](images/Strategies-Simulating-trading-costs-Slippage-and-unfilled-limits-1.viLUaTPh_Z17uYCF.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy(
     "Slippage Demo", overlay = true, slippage = 20,
     default_qty_value = 2, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity
 )

int length = input.int(5, "Length")

//@variable Exponential moving average with an input `length`.
float ma = ta.ema(close, length)

//@variable Is `true` when `ma` has increased and `close` is above it, `false` otherwise.
bool longCondition = close > ma and ma > ma[1]
//@variable Is `true` when `ma` has decreased and `close` is below it, `false` otherwise.
bool shortCondition = close < ma and ma < ma[1]

// Enter a long market position on `longCondition` and close the position on `shortCondition`. 
if longCondition    
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)
if shortCondition
    strategy.close("Buy")

//@variable The `bar_index` of the position's entry order fill.
int entryIndex = strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index(0)
//@variable The `bar_index` of the position's close order fill.
int exitIndex  = strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index(strategy.closedtrades - 1)

//@variable The fill price simulated by the strategy.
float fillPrice = switch bar_index
    entryIndex => strategy.opentrades.entry_price(0)
    exitIndex  => strategy.closedtrades.exit_price(strategy.closedtrades - 1)

//@variable The expected fill price of the open market position.
float expectedPrice = not na(fillPrice) ? open : na

color expectedColor = na
color filledColor   = na

if bar_index == entryIndex
    expectedColor := color.green
    filledColor   := color.blue
else if bar_index == exitIndex
    expectedColor := color.red
    filledColor   := color.fuchsia

plot(ma, color = color.new(color.orange, 50))

plotchar(not na(fillPrice) ? open : na, "Expected fill price", "—", location.absolute, expectedColor)
plotchar(fillPrice, "Fill price after slippage", "—", location.absolute, filledColor)
```

Note that:

- Since the strategy applies constant slippage to all order fills, some orders can fill *outside* the candle range in the simulation. Exercise caution with this setting, as adding excessive simulated slippage can produce unrealistically worse testing results.

Some traders might assume that they can avoid the adverse effects of slippage by using [limit orders](#limit-orders), as unlike [market orders](#market-orders), they cannot execute at a worse price than the specified value. However, even if the market price reaches an order's price, there's a chance that a limit order might not fill, depending on the state of the real-life market, because limit orders can only fill if a security has sufficient liquidity and price action around their values. To account for the possibility of *unfilled* orders in a backtest, users can specify the `backtest_fill_limits_assumption` value in the declaration statement or use the "Verify price for limit orders" input in the "Settings/Properties" tab. This setting instructs the strategy to fill limit orders only after the market price moves a defined number of ticks past the order prices.

The following example places a limit order of 2% equity at a bar's [hlcc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlcc4) price when the [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) is the `highest` value over the past `length` bars and there are no pending entries. The strategy closes the market position and cancels all orders after the [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) is the `lowest` value. Each time the strategy triggers an order, it draws a horizontal line at the `limitPrice`, which it updates on each bar until closing the position or canceling the order:

![image](images/Strategies-Simulating-trading-costs-Slippage-and-unfilled-limits-2.izbF-BkC_2p4GEQ.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy(
     "Verify price for limits example", overlay = true,
     default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value = 2
 )

int length = input.int(25, title = "Length")

//@variable Draws a line at the limit price of the most recent entry order.
var line limitLine = na

// Highest high and lowest low
highest = ta.highest(length)
lowest  = ta.lowest(length)

// Place an entry order and draw a new line when the the `high` equals the `highest` value and `limitLine` is `na`.
if high == highest and na(limitLine)
    float limitPrice = hlcc4
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, limit = limitPrice)
    limitLine := line.new(bar_index, limitPrice, bar_index + 1, limitPrice)

// Close the open market position, cancel orders, and set `limitLine` to `na` when the `low` equals the `lowest` value.
if low == lowest
    strategy.cancel_all()
    limitLine := na
    strategy.close_all()

// Update the `x2` value of `limitLine` if it isn't `na`.
if not na(limitLine)
    limitLine.set_x2(bar_index + 1) 

plot(highest, "Highest High", color = color.new(color.green, 50))
plot(lowest, "Lowest Low", color = color.new(color.red, 50))
```

By default, the script assumes that all limit orders are guaranteed to fill when the market price reaches their values, which is often not the case in real-life trading. Let's add price verification to our limit orders to account for potentially unfilled ones. In this example, we've included `backtest_fill_limits_assumption = 3` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function call. As we can see, using limit verification omits some simulated order fills and changes the times of others, because the entry orders can now only fill after the price exceeds the limit price by *three ticks*:

## [Risk management](https://www.tradingview.com#risk-management)

Designing a strategy that performs well, especially in a broad class of markets, is a challenging task. Most strategies are designed for specific market patterns/conditions and can produce uncontrolled losses when applied to other data. Therefore, a strategy's risk management behavior can be critical to its performance. Programmers can set risk management criteria in their strategy scripts using the `strategy.risk.*()` commands.

Strategies can incorporate any number of risk management criteria in any combination. All risk management commands execute *on every tick and order execution event*, regardless of any changes to the strategy's calculation behavior. There is no way to deactivate any of these commands on specific script executions. Irrespective of a risk management command's location, it *always* applies to the strategy unless the programmer removes the call from the code.

[strategy.risk.allow_entry_in()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Drisk%7Bdot%7Dallow_entry_in)

This command overrides the market direction allowed for all [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dentry) commands in the script. When a user specifies the trade direction with the [strategy.risk.allow_entry_in()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Drisk%7Bdot%7Dallow_entry_in) function (e.g., [long](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_strategy.direction.long)) the strategy enters trades only in that direction. If a script calls an entry command in the opposite direction while there's an open market position, the strategy simulates a [market order](#market-orders) to *close* the position.

[strategy.risk.max_cons_loss_days()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Drisk%7Bdot%7Dmax_cons_loss_days)

This command cancels all pending orders, closes any open market position, and stops all additional trade actions after the strategy simulates a defined number of trading days with consecutive losses.

[strategy.risk.max_drawdown()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Drisk%7Bdot%7Dmax_drawdown)

This command cancels all pending orders, closes any open market position, and stops all additional trade actions after the strategy's drawdown reaches the amount specified in the function call.

[strategy.risk.max_intraday_filled_orders()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Drisk%7Bdot%7Dmax_intraday_filled_orders)

This command specifies the maximum number of filled orders per trading day (or per chart bar if the timeframe is higher than daily). If the strategy creates more orders than  the maximum, the command cancels all pending orders, closes any open market position, and halts trading activity until the end of the current session.

[strategy.risk.max_intraday_loss()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Drisk%7Bdot%7Dmax_intraday_loss)

This command controls the maximum loss the strategy tolerates per trading day (or per chart bar if the timeframe is higher than daily). When the strategy's losses reach this threshold, it cancels all pending orders, closes the open market position, and stops all trading activity until the end of the current session.

[strategy.risk.max_position_size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Drisk%7Bdot%7Dmax_position_size)

This command specifies the maximum possible position size when using [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dentry) commands. If the quantity of an entry command results in a market position that exceeds this threshold, the strategy reduces the order quantity so that the resulting position does not exceed the limit.

## [Margin](https://www.tradingview.com#margin)

*Margin* is the minimum percentage of a market position that a trader must hold in their account as collateral to receive and sustain a loan from their broker to achieve their desired *leverage*. The `margin_long` and `margin_short` parameters of the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement and the "Margin for long/short positions" inputs in the "Properties" tab of the script settings specify margin percentages for long and short positions. For example, if a trader sets the margin for long positions to 25%, they must have enough funds to cover 25% of an open long position. This margin percentage also means the trader can potentially spend up to 400% of their equity on their trades.

If a strategy's simulated funds cannot cover the losses from a margin trade, the broker emulator triggers a *margin call*, which forcibly liquidates all or part of the open position. The exact number of contracts/shares/lots/units that the emulator liquidates is *four times* the amount required to cover the loss, which helps prevent constant margin calls on subsequent bars. The emulator determines liquidated quantity using the following algorithm:

1. Calculate the amount of capital spent on the position: `Money Spent = Quantity * Entry Price`
2. Calculate the Market Value of Security (MVS): `MVS = Position Size * Current Price`
3. Calculate the Open Profit as the difference between `MVS` and `Money Spent`. If the position is short, multiply this value by -1.
4. Calculate the strategy's equity value: `Equity = Initial Capital + Net Profit + Open Profit`
5. Calculate the margin ratio: `Margin Ratio = Margin Percent / 100`
6. Calculate the margin value, which is the cash required to cover the hypothetical account's portion of the position: `Margin = MVS * Margin Ratio`
7. Calculate the strategy's available funds: `Available Funds = Equity - Margin`
8. Calculate the total amount of money lost: `Loss = Available Funds / Margin Ratio`
9. Calculate the number of contracts/shares/lots/units the account must liquidate to cover the loss, truncated to the same decimal precision as the minimum position size for the current symbol: `Cover Amount = TRUNCATE(Loss / Current Price).`
10. Multiply the quantity required to cover the loss by four to determine the margin call size: `Margin Call Size = Cover Amount * 4`

To examine this calculation in detail, let's add the built-in Supertrend Strategy to the NASDAQ:TSLA
 chart on the "1D" timeframe and set the "Order size" to 300% of equity and the "Margin for long positions" to 25% in the "Properties" tab of the strategy settings:

![image](images/Strategies-Margin-1.D7HQz6iZ_Z2vIF4D.png)

The first entry happened at the bar's opening price on 16 Sep 2010. The strategy bought 682,438 shares (Position Size) at 4.43 USD (Entry Price). Then, on 23 Sep 2010, when the price dipped to 3.9 (Current Price), the emulator forcibly liquidated 111,052 shares with a margin call. The calculations below show how the broker emulator determined this amount for the margin call event:

```
Money spent: 682438 * 4.43 = 3023200.34MVS: 682438 * 3.9 = 2661508.2Open Profit: −361692.14Equity: 1000000 + 0 − 361692.14 = 638307.86Margin Ratio: 25 / 100 = 0.25Margin: 2661508.2 * 0.25 = 665377.05Available Funds: 638307.86 - 665377.05 = -27069.19Money Lost: -27069.19 / 0.25 = -108276.76Cover Amount: TRUNCATE(-108276.76 / 3.9) = TRUNCATE(-27763.27) = -27763Margin Call Size: -27763 * 4 = - 111052
```

Note that:

- The [strategy.margin_liquidation_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.margin_liquidation_price) variable's value represents the price level that will cause a margin call if the market price reaches it. For more information about how margin works and the formula for calculating a position's margin call price, see [this page](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000717375-how-do-i-simulate-trading-with-leverage/) in our Help Center.

## [Using strategy information in scripts](https://www.tradingview.com#using-strategy-information-in-scripts)

Numerous built-ins within the `strategy.*` namespace and its *sub-namespaces* provide convenient solutions for programmers to use a strategy's trade and performance information, including data shown in the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester), directly within their code's logic and calculations.

Several `strategy.*` variables hold fundamental information about a strategy, including its starting capital, equity, profits and losses, run-up and drawdown, and open position:

- [strategy.account_currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.account_currency)
- [strategy.initial_capital](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.initial_capital)
- [strategy.equity](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.equity)
- [strategy.netprofit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.netprofit) and [strategy.netprofit_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.netprofit_percent)
- [strategy.grossprofit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.grossprofit) and [strategy.grossprofit_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.grossprofit_percent)
- [strategy.grossloss](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.grossloss) and [strategy.grossloss_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.grossloss_percent)
- [strategy.openprofit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.openprofit) and [strategy.openprofit_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.openprofit_percent)
- [strategy.max_runup](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.max_runup) and [strategy.max_runup_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.max_runup_percent)
- [strategy.max_drawdown](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.max_drawdown) and [strategy.max_drawdown_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.max_drawdown_percent)
- [strategy.position_size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_size)
- [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price)
- [strategy.position_entry_name](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_entry_name)

Additionally, the namespace features multiple variables that hold general trade information, such as the number of open and closed trades, the number of winning and losing trades, average trade profits, and maximum trade sizes:

- [strategy.opentrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.opentrades)
- [strategy.closedtrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.closedtrades)
- [strategy.wintrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.wintrades)
- [strategy.losstrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.losstrades)
- [strategy.eventrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.eventrades)
- [strategy.avg_trade](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_trade) and [strategy.avg_trade_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_trade_percent)
- [strategy.avg_winning_trade](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_winning_trade) and [strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent)
- [strategy.avg_losing_trade](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_losing_trade) and [strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent)
- [strategy.max_contracts_held_all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.max_contracts_held_all)
- [strategy.max_contracts_held_long](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.max_contracts_held_long)
- [strategy.max_contracts_held_short](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.max_contracts_held_short)

Programmers can use these variables to display relevant strategy information on their charts, create customized trading logic based on strategy data, calculate custom performance metrics, and more.

The following example demonstrates a few simple use cases for these `strategy.*` variables. The script uses them in its order placement and display calculations. When the calculated `rank` crosses above 10 and the [strategy.opentrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.opentrades) value is 0, the script calls [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) to place a "Buy" [market order](#market-orders). On the following bar, where that order fills, it calls [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) to create a [stop-loss](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) order at a user-specified percentage below the [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price). If the `rank` crosses above 80 during the open trade, the script uses [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) to exit the position on the next bar.

The script draws a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the main chart pane displaying formatted strings containing the strategy's [net profit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.netprofit) and [net profit percentage](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.netprofit_percent), the [account currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.account_currency), the number of [winning trades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.wintrades) and the win percentage, the ratio of the [average profit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_winning_trade) to the [average loss](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.avg_losing_trade), and the profit factor (the ratio of the [gross profit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.grossprofit) to the [gross loss](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.grossloss)). It also plots the [total equity](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.equity) in a separate pane and highlights the pane's background based on the strategy's [open profit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.openprofit):

     )
    // Display the ratio of average trade profit to average trade loss. 
    dashboard.cell(0, 3, "Avg. win / Avg. loss")
    dashboard.cell(

         text_color = chart.fg_color, 
         bgcolor = strategy.avg_winning_trade > strategy.avg_losing_trade ? color.lime : color.red
     )
    // Display the profit factor, i.e., the ratio of gross profit to gross loss. 
    dashboard.cell(0, 4, "Profit factor")
    dashboard.cell(

 )
```

Note that:

- This script creates a [stop-loss](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) order one bar after the entry order because it uses [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price) to determine the price level. This variable has a non-na value only when the strategy has an *open position*.
- The script only draws the [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the last historical bar and all realtime bars because the historical states of [tables](#tables) are **never visible**. See the [Reducing drawing updates](#reducing-drawing-updates) section of the [Profiling and optimization](#profiling-and-optimization) page for more information.
- We included `force_overlay = true` in the [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.new) call to display the table on the main chart pane.

### [Individual trade information](https://www.tradingview.com#individual-trade-information)

The `strategy.*` namespace features two sub-namespaces that provide access to *individual trade* information: `strategy.opentrades.*` and `strategy.closedtrades.*`. The `strategy.opentrades.*` built-ins return data for *incomplete* (open) trades, and the `strategy.closedtrades.*` built-ins return data for *completed* (closed) trades. With these built-ins, programmers can use granular trade data in their scripts, allowing for more detailed strategy analysis and advanced calculations.

Both sub-namespaces contain several similar functions that return information about a trade's orders, simulated costs, and profit/loss, including:

- [strategy.opentrades.entry_id()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.opentrades.entry_id) / [strategy.closedtrades.entry_id()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.entry_id)

- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_id()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_id)
- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_price)
- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_time)
- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index)
- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_comment()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_comment)

Note that:

- Most built-ins within these namespaces are *functions*. However, the `strategy.opentrades.*` namespace also features a unique *variable*: [strategy.opentrades.capital_held](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.opentrades.capital_held). Its value represents the amount of capital reserved by *all* open trades.
- Only the `strategy.closedtrades.*` namespace has `.exit_*()` functions that return information about *exit orders*.

All `strategy.opentrades.*()` and `strategy.closedtrades.*()` functions have a `trade_num` parameter, which accepts an "int" value representing the index of the open or closed trade. The index of the first open/closed trade is 0, and the last trade's index is *one less* than the value of the [strategy.opentrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.opentrades)/[strategy.closedtrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.closedtrades) variable.

The following example places up to five long entry orders per position, each with a unique ID, and it calculates metrics for specific closed trades.

The strategy places a new entry order when the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) crosses above its `median` without reaching the `highest` value, but only if the number of [open trades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.opentrades) is less than five. It exits each position using [stop-loss](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) orders from [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) or a [market order](#market-orders) from [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all). Each successive entry order's ID depends on the number of open trades. The first entry ID in each position is "Buy0", and the last possible entry ID is "Buy4".

The script calls `strategy.closedtrades.*()` functions within a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to access closed trade [entry IDs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.entry_id), [profits](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.profit), [entry bar indices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index), and [exit bar indices](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index). It uses this information to calculate the total number of closed trades with the specified entry ID, the number of winning trades, the average number of bars per trade, and the total profit from all the trades. The script then organizes this information in a formatted string and displays it in a single-cell [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table):

Note that:

- This strategy can open up to five long trades per position because we included `pyramiding = 5` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement. See the [pyramiding](#pyramiding) section for more information.
- The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) instance in this script persists and generates exit orders for every entry in the open position because we did not specify a `from_entry` ID. See the [Exits for multiple entries](#exits-for-multiple-entries) section to learn more about this behavior.

## [Strategy alerts](https://www.tradingview.com#strategy-alerts)

Pine Script™ indicators (not strategies) have two different mechanisms to set up custom alert conditions: the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function, which tracks one specific condition per function call, and the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function, which tracks all its calls simultaneously, but provides greater flexibility in the number of calls, alert messages, etc.

Pine Script™ strategies cannot create alert triggers using the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function, but they can create triggers with the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function. Additionally, each [order placement command](#order-placement-and-cancellation) comes with its own built-in alert functionality that does not require any additional code to implement. As such, any strategy that uses an order placement command can issue alerts upon order execution. The precise mechanics of such built-in strategy alerts are described in the [Order Fill events](#order-fill-events) section of the [Alerts](#alerts) page.

When a strategy uses both the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function and functions that create orders in the same script, the "Create Alert" dialog box provides a choice between the conditions to use as a trigger: [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) events, order fill events, or both.

For many trading strategies, the delay between a triggered alert and a live trade can be a critical performance factor. By default, strategy scripts can only execute [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function calls on the close of realtime bars, as if they used [alert.freq_once_per_bar_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_alert%7Bdot%7Dfreq_once_per_bar_close), regardless of the `freq` argument in the call. Users can change the alert frequency by including  `calc_on_every_tick = true` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) call or selecting the "Recalculate/On every tick" option in the "Settings/Properties" tab before creating the alert. However, depending on the script, this setting can adversely impact the strategy's behavior. See the [`calc_on_every_tick`](#calc_on_every_tick) section for more information.

Order fill alert triggers do not suffer the same limitations as the triggers from [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) calls, which makes them more suitable for sending alerts to third parties for automation. Alerts from order fill events execute *immediately*, unaffected by a script's `calc_on_every_tick` setting. Users can set the default message for order fill alerts via the `//@strategy_alert_message` compiler annotation. The text provided with this annotation populates the "Message" field in the "Create Alert" dialog box.

The following script shows a simple example of a default order fill alert message. Above the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, the script includes `@strategy_alert_message` with [*placeholders*](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000531021-how-to-use-a-variable-value-in-alert/) for the trade action, current position size, ticker name, and fill price values in the message text:

```
//@version=6
//@strategy_alert_message {{strategy.order.action}} {{strategy.position_size}} {{ticker}} @ {{strategy.order.price}}
strategy("Alert Message Demo", overlay = true)
float fastMa = ta.sma(close, 5)
float slowMa = ta.sma(close, 10)

if ta.crossover(fastMa, slowMa)
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)

if ta.crossunder(fastMa, slowMa)
    strategy.entry("sell", strategy.short)

plot(fastMa, "Fast MA", color.aqua)
plot(slowMa, "Slow MA", color.orange)
```

This script populates the "Create Alert" dialog box with its default message when the user selects its name from the "Condition" dropdown tab:

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-alerts-1.BxOEoyCe_ZM3QoM.png)

When the alert fires, the strategy populates the placeholders in the alert message with their corresponding values. For example:

## [Notes on testing strategies](https://www.tradingview.com#notes-on-testing-strategies)

Testing and tuning strategies in historical and live market conditions can provide insight into a strategy's characteristics, potential weaknesses, and *possibly* its future potential. However, traders should always be aware of the biases and limitations of simulated strategy results, especially when using the results to support live trading decisions. This section outlines some caveats associated with strategy validation and tuning and possible solutions to mitigate their effects.

### [Backtesting and forward testing](https://www.tradingview.com#backtesting-and-forward-testing)

*Backtesting* is a technique to evaluate the historical performance of a trading strategy or model by simulating and analyzing its past results on historical market data. This technique assumes that a strategy's results on past data can provide insight into its strengths and weaknesses. When backtesting, many traders adjust the parameters of a strategy in an attempt to optimize its results. Analysis and optimization of historical results can help traders to gain a deeper understanding of a strategy. However, traders should always understand the risks and limitations when basing their decisions on optimized backtest results.

It is prudent to also use realtime analysis as a tool for evaluating a trading system on a forward-looking basis. *Forward testing* aims to gauge the performance of a strategy in live market conditions, where factors such as trading costs, slippage, and liquidity can meaningfully affect its performance. While forward testing has the distinct advantage of not being affected by certain types of biases (e.g., lookahead bias or "future data leakage"), it does carry the disadvantage of being limited in the quantity of data to test. Therefore, although it can provide helpful insights into a strategy's performance in current market conditions, forward testing is not typically used on its own.

### [Lookahead bias](https://www.tradingview.com#lookahead-bias)

One typical issue in backtesting strategies that request alternate timeframe data, use repainting variables such as [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow), or alter calculation behavior for intrabar order fills, is the leakage of future data into the past during evaluation, which is known as *lookahead bias*. Not only is this bias a common cause of unrealistic strategy results, since the future is never actually knowable beforehand, but it is also one of the typical causes of strategy repainting.

Traders can often confirm whether a strategy has lookahead bias by forward testing it on realtime data, where no known data exists beyond the latest bar. Since there is no future data to leak into the past on realtime bars, the strategy will behave differently on historical and realtime bars if its results have lookahead bias.

To eliminate lookahead bias in a strategy:

- Do not use repainting variables that leak future values into the past in the order placement or cancellation logic.
- Do not include [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge%7Bdot%7Dlookahead_on) in `request.*()` calls without offsetting the data series, as described in [this](#future-leak-with-requestsecurity) section of the [Repainting](#repainting) page.
- Use realistic strategy calculation behavior.

### [Selection bias](https://www.tradingview.com#selection-bias)

Selection bias occurs when a trader analyzes only results on specific instruments or timeframes while ignoring others. This bias can distort the perspective of the strategy's robustness, which can impact trading decisions and performance optimizations. Traders can reduce the effects of selection bias by evaluating their strategies on multiple, ideally diverse, symbols and timeframes, and ensuring not to ignore poor performance results or "cherry-pick" testing ranges.

### [Overfitting](https://www.tradingview.com#overfitting)

A common problem when optimizing a strategy based on backtest results is overfitting ("curve fitting"), which means tailoring the strategy for specific data. An overfitted strategy often fails to generalize well on new, unseen data. One widely-used approach to help reduce the potential for overfitting and promote better generalization is to split an instrument's data into two or more parts to test the strategy outside the sample used for optimization, otherwise known as "in-sample" (IS) and "out-of-sample" (OOS) backtesting.

In this approach, traders optimize strategy parameters on the IS data, and they test the optimized configuration on the OOS data without additional fine-tuning. Although this and other, more robust approaches might provide a glimpse into how a strategy might fare after optimization, traders should still exercise caution. No trading strategy can guarantee future performance, regardless of the data used for optimization and testing, because the future is inherently unknowable.

### [Order limit](https://www.tradingview.com#order-limit)

Outside of Deep Backtesting, a strategy can keep track of up to 9000 orders. If a strategy creates more than 9000 orders, the earliest orders are *trimmed* so that the strategy  stores the information for only the most recent orders.

Trimmed orders do **not** appear in the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester). Referencing the trimmed order IDs using `strategy.closedtrades.*` functions returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

The [strategy.closedtrades.first_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.closedtrades.first_index) variable holds the index of the oldest *untrimmed* trade, which corresponds to the first trade listed in the [List of Trades](#list-of-trades). If the strategy creates less than 9000 orders, there are no trimmed orders, and this variable's value is 0.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Tables

# [Tables](https://www.tradingview.com#tables)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Tables are objects that can be used to position information in specific
and fixed locations in a script's visual space. Contrary to all other
plots or objects drawn in Pine Script™, tables are not anchored to
specific bars; they *float* in a script's space, whether in overlay or
pane mode, in studies or strategies, independently of the chart bars
being viewed or the zoom factor used.

Tables contain cells arranged in columns and rows, much like a
spreadsheet. They are created and populated in two distincts steps:

1. A table's structure and key attributes are defined using
   [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dnew),
   which returns a table ID that acts like a pointer to the table, just
   like label, line, or array IDs do. The
   [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dnew)
   call will create the table object but does not display it.
2. Once created, and for it to display, the table must be populated
   using one
   [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
   call for each cell. Table cells can contain text, or not. This
   second step is when the width and height of cells are defined.

Most attributes of a previously created table can be changed using
`table.set_*()` setter functions. Attributes of previously populated
cells can be modified using `table.cell_set_*()` functions.

A table is positioned in an indicator's space by anchoring it to one of
nine references: the four corners or midpoints, including the center.
Tables are positioned by expanding the table from its anchor, so a table
anchored to the
[position.middle_right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dmiddle_right)
reference will be drawn by expanding up, down and left from that anchor.

Two modes are available to determine the width/height of table cells:

- A default automatic mode calculates the width/height of cells in a
  column/row using the widest/highest text in them.
- An explicit mode allows programmers to define the width/height of
  cells using a percentage of the indicator's available x/y space.

Displayed table contents always represent the last state of the table,
as it was drawn on the script's last execution, on the dataset's last
bar. Contrary to values displayed in the Data Window or in indicator
values, variable contents displayed in tables will thus not change as a
script user moves his cursor over specific chart bars. For this reason,
it is strongly recommended to always restrict execution of all
`table.*()` calls to either the first or last bars of the dataset.
Accordingly:

- Use the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword to declare tables.
- Enclose all other calls inside an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
  block.

**Multiple tables can be used in one script, as long as they are each
anchored to a different position. Each table object is identified by its
own ID. Limits on the quantity of cells in all tables are determined by
the total number of cells used in one script.**

## [Creating tables](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-tables)

When creating a table using
[table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dnew),
three parameters are mandatory: the table's position and its number of
columns and rows. Five other parameters are optional: the table's
background color, the color and width of the table's outer frame, and
the color and width of the borders around all cells, excluding the outer
frame. All table attributes except its number of columns and rows can be
modified using setter functions:
[table.set_position()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dset_position),
[table.set_bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dset_bgcolor),
[table.set_frame_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dset_frame_color),
[table.set_frame_width()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dset_frame_width),
[table.set_border_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dset_border_color)
and
[table.set_border_width()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dset_border_width).

Tables can be deleted using
[table.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Ddelete),
and their content can be selectively removed using
[table.clear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dclear).

When populating cells using
[table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell),
you must supply an argument for four mandatory parameters: the table id
the cell belongs to, its column and row index using indices that start
at zero, and the text string the cell contains, which can be null. Other parameters are optional: the width and height of the cell, the text's attributes (color, horizontal and vertical alignment, size, formatting), and
the cell's background color. All cell attributes can be modified using
setter functions:
[table.cell_set_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_text),
[table.cell_set_width()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_width),
[table.cell_set_height()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_height),
[table.cell_set_text_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_text_color),
[table.cell_set_text_halign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_text_halign),
[table.cell_set_text_valign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_text_valign),
[table.cell_set_text_size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_text_size),
[table.cell_set_text_formatting()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell_set_text_formatting),
and
[table.cell_set_bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell_set_bgcolor).

Keep in mind that each successive call to
[table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
redefines **all** the cell's properties, deleting any properties set by
previous
[table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
calls on the same cell.

### [Placing a single value in a fixed position](https://www.tradingview.com#placing-a-single-value-in-a-fixed-position)

Let's create our first table, which will place the value of ATR in the
upper-right corner of the chart. We first create a one-cell table, then
populate that cell:

```
//@version=6
indicator("ATR", "", true)
// We use `var` to only initialize the table on the first bar.
var table atrDisplay = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
// We call `ta.atr()` outside the `if` block so it executes on each bar.
myAtr = ta.atr(14)
if barstate.islast
    // We only populate the table on the last bar.
    table.cell(atrDisplay, 0, 0, str.tostring(myAtr))
```

![image](images/Tables-ATR-1.aAFiA0fe_Z1KtXS4.png)

Note that:

- We use the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword when creating the table with
  [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dnew).
- We populate the cell inside an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
  block using
  [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell).
- When populating the cell, we do not specify the `width` or `height`.
  The width and height of our cell will thus adjust automatically to
  the text it contains.
- We call `ta.atr(14)` prior to entry in our
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  block so that it evaluates on each bar. Had we used
  `str.tostring(ta.atr(14))` inside the
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  block, the function would not have evaluated correctly because it
  would be called on the dataset's last bar without having calculated
  the necessary values from the previous bars.

Let's improve the usability and aesthethics of our script:

```
//@version=6
indicator("ATR", "", true)
atrPeriodInput = input.int(14,  "ATR period", minval = 1, tooltip = "Using a period of 1 yields True Range.")

var table atrDisplay = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1, bgcolor = color.gray, frame_width = 2, frame_color = color.black)
myAtr = ta.atr(atrPeriodInput)
if barstate.islast
    table.cell(atrDisplay, 0, 0, str.tostring(myAtr, format.mintick), text_color = color.white)
```

![image](images/Tables-ATR-2.DwFmCnwy_Z1htA0D.png)

Note that:

- We used
  [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  to define a background color, a frame color and its width.
- When populating the cell with
  [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell),
  we set the text to display in white.
- We pass
  [format.mintick](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_format%7Bdot%7Dmintick)
  as a second argument to the
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dtostring)
  function to restrict the precision of ATR to the chart's tick
  precision.
- We now use an input to allow the script user to specify the period
  of ATR. The input also includes a tooltip, which the user can see
  when he hovers over the "i" icon in the script's
  "Settings/Inputs" tab.

### [Coloring the chart's background](https://www.tradingview.com#coloring-the-charts-background)

This example uses a one-cell table to color the chart's background on
the bull/bear state of RSI:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Chart background", "", true)
bullColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.green, 95), "Bull", inline = "1")
bearColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.red, 95), "Bear", inline = "1")
// ————— Function colors chart bg on RSI bull/bear state.
colorChartBg(bullColor, bearColor) =>
    var table bgTable = table.new(position.middle_center, 1, 1)
    float r = ta.rsi(close, 20)
    color bgColor = r > 50 ? bullColor : r < 50 ? bearColor : na
    if barstate.islast
        table.cell(bgTable, 0, 0, width = 100, height = 100, bgcolor = bgColor)

colorChartBg(bullColorInput, bearColorInput)
```

Note that:

- We provide users with inputs allowing them to specify the bull/bear
  colors to use for the background, and send those input colors as
  arguments to our `colorChartBg()` function.
- We create a new table only once, using the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword to declare the table.
- We use
  [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
  on the last bar only, to specify the cell's properties. We make the
  cell the width and height of the indicator's space, so it covers
  the whole chart.

### [Creating a display panel](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-a-display-panel)

Tables are ideal to create sophisticated display panels. Not only do
they make it possible for display panels to always be visible in a
constant position, they provide more flexible formatting because each
cell's properties are controlled separately: background, text color,
size and alignment, etc.

Here, we create a basic display panel showing a user-selected quantity
of MAs values. We display their period in the first column, then their
value with a green/red/gray background that varies with price's
position with regards to each MA. When price is above/below the MA, the
cell's background is colored with the bull/bear color. When the MA
falls between the current bar's
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open)
and
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
the cell's background is of the neutral color:

![image](images/Tables-DisplayPanel-1.BUQMSYyF_1oOTmO.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Price vs MA", "", true)

var string GP1 = "Moving averages"
int     masQtyInput    = input.int(20, "Quantity", minval = 1, maxval = 40, group = GP1, tooltip = "1-40")
int     masStartInput  = input.int(20, "Periods begin at", minval = 2, maxval = 200, group = GP1, tooltip = "2-200")
int     masStepInput   = input.int(20, "Periods increase by", minval = 1, maxval = 100, group = GP1, tooltip = "1-100")

var string GP2 = "Display"
string  tableYposInput = input.string("top", "Panel position", inline = "11", options = ["top", "middle", "bottom"], group = GP2)
string  tableXposInput = input.string("right", "", inline = "11", options = ["left", "center", "right"], group = GP2)
color   bullColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.green, 30), "Bull", inline = "12", group = GP2)
color   bearColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.red, 30), "Bear", inline = "12", group = GP2)
color   neutColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.gray, 30), "Neutral", inline = "12", group = GP2)

var table panel = table.new(tableYposInput + "_" + tableXposInput, 2, masQtyInput + 1)
if barstate.islast
    // Table header.
    table.cell(panel, 0, 0, "MA", bgcolor = neutColorInput)
    table.cell(panel, 1, 0, "Value", bgcolor = neutColorInput)

int period = masStartInput
for i = 1 to masQtyInput
    // ————— Call MAs on each bar.
    float ma = ta.sma(close, period)
    // ————— Only execute table code on last bar.
    if barstate.islast
        // Period in left column.
        table.cell(panel, 0, i, str.tostring(period), bgcolor = neutColorInput)
        // If MA is between the open and close, use neutral color. If close is lower/higher than MA, use bull/bear color.
        bgColor = close > ma ? open < ma ? neutColorInput : bullColorInput : open > ma ? neutColorInput : bearColorInput
        // MA value in right column.
        table.cell(panel, 1, i, str.tostring(ma, format.mintick), text_color = color.black, bgcolor = bgColor)
    period += masStepInput
```

Note that:

- Users can select the table's position from the inputs, as well as
  the bull/bear/neutral colors to be used for the background of the
  right column's cells.
- The table's quantity of rows is determined using the number of MAs
  the user chooses to display. We add one row for the column headers.
- Even though we populate the table cells on the last bar only, we
  need to execute the calls to
  [ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dsma)
  on every bar so they produce the correct results. The compiler
  warning that appears when you compile the code can be safely
  ignored.
- We separate our inputs in two sections using `group`, and join the
  relevant ones on the same line using `inline`. We supply tooltips to
  document the limits of certain fields using `tooltip`.

### [Displaying a heatmap](https://www.tradingview.com#displaying-a-heatmap)

Our next project is a heatmap, which will indicate the bull/bear
relationship of the current price relative to its past values. To do so,
we will use a table positioned at the bottom of the chart. We will
display colors only, so our table will contain no text; we will simply
color the background of its cells to produce our heatmap. The heatmap
uses a user-selectable lookback period. It loops across that period to
determine if price is above/below each bar in that past, and displays a
progressively lighter intensity of the bull/bear color as we go further
in the past:

![image](images/Tables-Heatmap-1.BRQU14P0_ZbbqpM.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Price vs Past", "", true)

var int MAX_LOOKBACK = 300

int     lookBackInput  = input.int(150, minval = 1, maxval = MAX_LOOKBACK, step = 10)
color   bullColorInput = input.color(#00FF00ff, "Bull", inline = "11")
color   bearColorInput = input.color(#FF0080ff, "Bear", inline = "11")

// ————— Function draws a heatmap showing the position of the current `_src` relative to its past `_lookBack` values.
drawHeatmap(src, lookBack) =>
    // float src     : evaluated price series.
    // int   lookBack: number of past bars evaluated.
    // Dependency: MAX_LOOKBACK

    // Force historical buffer to a sufficient size.
    max_bars_back(src, MAX_LOOKBACK)
    // Only run table code on last bar.
    if barstate.islast
        var heatmap = table.new(position.bottom_center, lookBack, 1)
        for i = 1 to lookBackInput
            float transp = 100. * i / lookBack
            if src > src[i]
                table.cell(heatmap, lookBack - i, 0, bgcolor = color.new(bullColorInput, transp))
            else
                table.cell(heatmap, lookBack - i, 0, bgcolor = color.new(bearColorInput, transp))

drawHeatmap(high, lookBackInput)
```

Note that:

- We define a maximum lookback period as a `MAX_LOOKBACK` constant.
  This is an important value and we use it for two purposes: to
  specify the number of columns we will create in our one-row table,
  and to specify the lookback period required for the `_src` argument
  in our function, so that we force Pine Script™ to create a
  historical buffer size that will allow us to refer to the required
  quantity of past values of `_src` in our
  [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)
  loop.
- We offer users the possibility of configuring the bull/bear colors
  in the inputs and we use `inline` to place the color selections on
  the same line.
- Inside our function, we enclose our table-creation code in an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
  construct so that it only runs on the last bar of the chart.
- The initialization of the table is done inside the
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  statement. Because of that, and the fact that it uses the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword, initialization only occurs the first time the script
  executes on a last bar. Note that this behavior is different from
  the usual
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  declarations in the script's global scope, where initialization
  occurs on the first bar of the dataset, at
  [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
  zero.
- We do not specify an argument to the `text` parameter in our
  [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
  calls, so an empty string is used.
- We calculate our transparency in such a way that the intensity of
  the colors decreases as we go further in history.
- We use dynamic color generation to create different transparencies
  of our base colors as needed.
- Contrary to other objects displayed in Pine scripts, this heatmap's
  cells are not linked to chart bars. The configured lookback period
  determines how many table cells the heatmap contains, and the
  heatmap will not change as the chart is panned horizontally, or
  scaled.
- The maximum number of cells that can be displayed in the scritp's
  visual space will depend on your viewing device's resolution and
  the portion of the display used by your chart. Higher resolution
  screens and wider windows will allow more table cells to be
  displayed.

## [Tips](https://www.tradingview.com#tips)

- When creating tables in strategy scripts, keep in mind that unless
  the strategy uses `calc_on_every_tick = true`, table code enclosed
  in [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate%7Bdot%7Dislast)
  blocks will not execute on each realtime update, so the table will
  not display as you expect.
- Keep in mind that successive calls to
  [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
  overwrite the cell's properties specified by previous
  [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
  calls. Use the setter functions to modify a cell's properties.
- Remember to control the execution of your table code wisely by
  restricting it to the necessary bars only. This saves server
  resources and your charts will display faster, so everybody wins.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Text and shapes

# [Text and shapes](https://www.tradingview.com#text-and-shapes)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

You may display text or shapes using five different ways with Pine
Script™:

- [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
- [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
- [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
- Labels created with
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
- Tables created with
  [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  (see [Tables](#tables))

Which one to use depends on your needs:

- Tables can display text in various relative positions on charts that
  will not move as users scroll of zoom the chart horizontally. Their
  content is not tethered to bars. In contrast, text displayed with
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar),
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  or
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  is always tethered to a specific bar, so it will move with the
  bar's position on the chart. See the page on
  [Tables](#tables) for more
  information on them.
- Three function include are able to display pre-defined shapes:
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape),
  [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
  and Labels created with
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew).
- [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
  cannot display text, only up or down arrows.
- [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  and
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  can display non-dynamic text on any bar or all bars of the chart.
- [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  can only display one character while
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  can display strings, including line breaks.
- [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  can display a maximum of 500 labels on the chart. Its text **can**
  contain dynamic text, or "series strings". Line breaks are also
  supported in label text.
- While
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  and
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  can display text at a fixed offset in the past or the future, which
  cannot change during the script's execution, each
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  call can use a "series" offset that can be calculated on the fly.

These are a few things to keep in mind concerning Pine Script™ strings:

- Since the `text` parameter in both
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  and
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  require a "const string" argument, it cannot contain values such
  as prices that can only be known on the bar ("series string").
- To include "series" values in text displayed using
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew),
  they will first need to be converted to strings using
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dtostring).
- The concatenation operator for strings in Pine is `+`. It is used to
  join string components into one string, e.g.,
  `msg = "Chart symbol: " + syminfo.tickerid` (where
  [syminfo.tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo%7Bdot%7Dtickerid)
  is a built-in variable that returns the chart's exchange and symbol
  information in string format).
- Characters displayed by all these functions can be Unicode
  characters, which may include Unicode symbols. See this [Exploring
  Unicode](https://www.tradingview.com/script/0rFQOCKf-Exploring-Unicode/)
  script to get an idea of what can be done with Unicode characters.
- Some functions have parameters that can specify the color, size, font family, and formatting of displayed text. For example, drawing objects like [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new), [tables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.new), and [boxes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new) support text formatting such as bold, italics, and monospace.
- Pine scripts display strings using the system default font. The exact font may vary based on the user's operating system.

This script displays text using the four methods available in Pine
Script™:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Four displays of text", overlay = true)
plotchar(ta.rising(close, 5), "`plotchar()`", "🠅", location.belowbar, color.lime, size = size.small)
plotshape(ta.falling(close, 5), "`plotchar()`", location = location.abovebar, color = na, text = "•`plotshape()•`\n🠇", textcolor = color.fuchsia, size = size.huge)

if bar_index % 25 == 0
    label.new(bar_index, na, "•LABEL•\nHigh = " + str.tostring(high, format.mintick) + "\n🠇", yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_none, textcolor = color.black, size = size.normal)

printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
printTable("•TABLE•\n" + str.tostring(bar_index + 1) + " bars\nin the dataset")
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Introduction-01.Caf7GxqL_Z22HKK1.png)

Note that:

- The method used to display each text string is shown with the text,
  except for the lime up arrows displayed using
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar),
  as it can only display one character.
- Label and table calls can be inserted in conditional structures to
  control when their are executed, whereas
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  and
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  cannot. Their conditional plotting must be controlled using their
  first argument, which is a "series bool" whose `true` or `false`
  value determines when the text is displayed.
- Numeric values displayed in the table and labels is first converted
  to a string using
  [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dtostring).
- We use the `+` operator to concatenate string components.
- [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  is designed to display a shape with accompanying text. Its `size`
  parameter controls the size of the shape, not of the text. We use
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  for its `color` argument so that the shape is not visible.
- Contrary to other texts, the table text will not move as you scroll
  or scale the chart.
- Some text strings contain the 🠇 Unicode arrow (U+1F807).
- Some text strings contain the `\n` sequence that represents a new

## [`plotchar()`](https://www.tradingview.com#plotchar)

This function is useful to display a single character on bars. It has
the following syntax:

```
plotchar(series, title, char, location, color, offset, text, textcolor, editable, size, show_last, display, force_overlay) → void
```

See the [Reference Manual entry for
plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
for details on its parameters.

As explained in the
[Without affecting the scale](#without-affecting-the-scale) section of our page on
[Debugging](#debugging), the function
can be used to display and inspect values in the Data Window or in the
indicator values displayed to the right of the script's name on the
chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
plotchar(bar_index, "Bar index", "", location.top)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Plotchar-01.Bocx9V6g_Z13RLu0.png)

Note that:

- The cursor is on the chart's last bar.
- The value of
  [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
  on **that** bar is displayed in indicator values (1) and in the Data
  Window (2).
- We use
  [location.top](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_location%7Bdot%7Dtop)
  because the default
  [location.abovebar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_location%7Bdot%7Dabovebar)
  will put the price into play in the script's scale, which will
  often interfere with other plots.

[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
also works well to identify specific points on the chart or to validate
that conditions are `true` when we expect them to be. This example
displays an up arrow under bars where
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close),
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
have all been rising for two bars:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
bool longSignal = ta.rising(close, 2) and ta.rising(high, 2) and (na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2))
plotchar(longSignal, "Long", "▲", location.belowbar, color = na(volume) ? color.gray : color.blue, size = size.tiny)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Plotchar-02.CP9gwRwQ_cuUlM.png)

Note that:

- We use `(na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2))` so our script will
  work on symbols without
  [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
  data. If we did not make provisions for when there is no
  [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
  data, which is what `na(volume)` does by being `true` when there is
  no volume, the `longSignal` variable's value would never be `true`
  because `ta.rising(volume, 2)` yields `false` in those cases.
- We display the arrow in gray when there is no volume, to remind us
  that all three base conditions are not being met.
- Because
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  is now displaying a character on the chart, we use
  `size = size.tiny` to control its size.
- We have adapted the `location` argument to display the character
  under bars.

If you don't mind plotting only circles, you could also use
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
to achieve a similar effect:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
longSignal = ta.rising(close, 2) and ta.rising(high, 2) and (na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2))
plot(longSignal ? low - ta.tr : na, "Long", color.blue, 2, plot.style_circles)
```

This method has the inconvenience that, since there is no relative
positioning mechanism with
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
one must shift the circles down using something like
[ta.tr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ta%7Bdot%7Dtr)
(the bar's "True Range"):

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Plotchar-03.lnUtjJIt_5GDoG.png)

## [`plotshape()`](https://www.tradingview.com#plotshape)

This function is useful to display pre-defined shapes and/or text on
bars. It has the following syntax:

```
plotshape(series, title, style, location, color, offset, text, textcolor, editable, size, show_last, display, force_overlay) → void
```

See the [Reference Manual entry for
plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
for details on its parameters.

Let's use the function to achieve more or less the same result as with
our second example of the previous section:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
longSignal = ta.rising(close, 2) and ta.rising(high, 2) and (na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2))
plotshape(longSignal, "Long", shape.arrowup, location.belowbar)
```

Note that here, rather than using an arrow character, we are using the
`shape.arrowup` argument for the `style` parameter.

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Plotshape-01.JOPpSRCa_1wGGd4.png)

It is possible to use different
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
calls to superimpose text on bars. You will need to use `\n` followed by
a special non-printing character that doesn't get stripped out to
preserve the newline's functionality. Here we're using a Unicode
Zero-width space (U+200E). While you don't see it in the following
code's strings, it is there and can be copy/pasted. The special Unicode
character needs to be the **last** one in the string for text going up,
and the **first** one when you are plotting under the bar and text is
going down:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Lift text", "", true)
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowup,   location.abovebar, color.green,  text = "A")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowup,   location.abovebar, color.lime,   text = "B\n​")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.red,    text = "C")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.maroon, text = "​\nD")
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Plotshape-02.CuvXGcSI_3Ad17.png)

The available shapes you can use with the `style` parameter are:

The
[plotarrow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
function displays up or down arrows of variable length, based on the
relative value of the series used in the function's first argument. It
has the following syntax:

```
plotarrow(series, title, colorup, colordown, offset, minheight, maxheight, editable, show_last, display, force_overlay) → void
```

See the [Reference Manual entry for
plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
for details on its parameters.

The `series` parameter in
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
is not a "series bool" as in
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
and
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape);
it is a "series int/float" and there's more to it than a simple
`true` or `false` value determining when the arrows are plotted. This is
the logic governing how the argument supplied to `series` affects the
behavior of
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow):

- `series > 0`: An up arrow is displayed, the length of which will be
  proportional to the relative value of the series on that bar in
  relation to other series values.
- `series < 0`: A down arrow is displayed, proportionally-sized using
  the same rules.
- `series == 0 or na(series)`: No arrow is displayed.

The maximum and minimum possible sizes for the arrows (in pixels) can be
controlled using the `minheight` and `maxheight` parameters.

Here is a simple script illustrating how
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
works:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
body = close - open
plotarrow(body, colorup = color.teal, colordown = color.orange)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Plotarrow-01.KkXXJXUI_Z1LV4X8.png)

Note how the heigth of arrows is proportional to the relative size of
the bar bodies.

You can use any series to plot the arrows. Here we use the value of the
"Chaikin Oscillator" to control the location and size of the arrows:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Chaikin Oscillator Arrows", overlay = true)
fastLengthInput = input.int(3,  minval = 1)
slowLengthInput = input.int(10, minval = 1)
osc = ta.ema(ta.accdist, fastLengthInput) - ta.ema(ta.accdist, slowLengthInput)
plotarrow(osc)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-Plotarrow-02.ChRmPIiy_Zb0OYl.png)

Note that we display the actual "Chaikin Oscillator" in a pane below
the chart, so you can see what values are used to determine the position
and size of the arrows.

## [Labels](https://www.tradingview.com#labels)

Labels are only available in v4 and higher versions of Pine Script™.
They work very differently than
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
and
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape).

Labels are objects, like
[lines and boxes](#lines-and-boxes), or
[tables](#tables). Like them, they are
referred to using an ID, which acts like a pointer. Label IDs are of
"label" type. As with other objects, labels IDs are "time series"
and all the functions used to manage them accept "series" arguments,
which makes them very flexible.

Labels are advantageous because:

- They allow "series" values to be converted to text and placed on
  charts. This means they are ideal to display values that cannot be
  known before time, such as price values, support and resistance
  levels, of any other values that your script calculates.
- Their positioning options are more flexible that those of the
  `plot*()` functions.
- They offer more display modes.
- Contrary to `plot*()` functions, label-handling functions can be
  inserted in conditional or loop structures, making it easier to
  control their behavior.
- You can add tooltips to labels.

One drawback to using labels versus
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
and
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
is that you can only draw a limited quantity of them on the chart. The
default is ~50, but you can use the `max_labels_count` parameter in
your
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
or
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
declaration statement to specify up to 500. Labels, like
[lines and boxes](#lines-and-boxes), are
managed using a garbage collection mechanism which deletes the oldest
ones on the chart, such that only the most recently drawn labels are
visible.

Your toolbox of built-ins to manage labels are all in the `label`
namespace. They include:

- [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  to create labels.
- `label.set_*()` functions to modify the properties of an existing
  label.
- `label.get_*()` functions to read the properties of an existing
  label.
- [label.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Ddelete)
  to delete labels
- The
  [label.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_label%7Bdot%7Dall)
  array which always contains the IDs of all the visible labels on the
  chart. The array's size will depend on the maximum label count for
  your script and how many of those you have drawn.
  `aray.size(label.all)` will return the array's size.

### [Creating and modifying labels](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-and-modifying-labels)

The
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
function creates a new label. It has the following signature:

```
label.new(x, y, text, xloc, yloc, color, style, textcolor, size, textalign, tooltip, force_overylay) → series label
```

The *setter* functions allowing you to change a label's properties are:

- [label.set_x()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_x)
- [label.set_y()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_y)
- [label.set_xy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_xy)
- [label.set_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_text)
- [label.set_xloc()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_xloc)
- [label.set_yloc()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_yloc)
- [label.set_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_color)
- [label.set_style()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_style)
- [label.set_textcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_textcolor)
- [label.set_size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_size)
- [label.set_textalign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_set_textalign)
- [label.set_tooltip()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_tooltip)

They all have a similar signature. The one for
[label.set_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_color)
is:

```
label.set_color(id, color) → void
```

where:

- `id` is the ID of the label whose property is to be modified.
- The next parameter is the property of the label to modify. It
  depends on the setter function used.
  [label.set_xy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_xy)
  changes two properties, so it has two such parameters.

This is how you can create labels in their simplest form:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
label.new(bar_index, high)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-CreatingLabels-01.BHaO-o78_Y8WYV.png)

Note that:

- The label is created with the parameters `x = bar_index` (the index
  of the current bar,
  [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index))
  and `y = high` (the bar's
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
  value).
- We do not supply an argument for the function's `text` parameter.
  Its default value being an empty string, no text is displayed.
- No logic controls our
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  call, so labels are created on every bar.
- Only the last 54 labels are displayed because our
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  call does not use the `max_labels_count` parameter to specify a
  value other than the ~50 default.
- Labels persist on bars until your script deletes them using
  [label.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Ddelete),
  or garbage collection removes them.

In the next example we display a label on the bar with the highest
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
value in the last 50 bars:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)

// Find the highest `high` in last 50 bars and its offset. Change it's sign so it is positive.
LOOKBACK = 50
hi = ta.highest(LOOKBACK)
highestBarOffset = - ta.highestbars(LOOKBACK)

// Create label on bar zero only.
var lbl = label.new(na, na, "", color = color.orange, style = label.style_label_lower_left)
// When a new high is found, move the label there and update its text and tooltip.
if ta.change(hi) != 0
    // Build label and tooltip strings.
    labelText = "High: " + str.tostring(hi, format.mintick)
    tooltipText = "Offest in bars: " + str.tostring(highestBarOffset) + "\nLow: " + str.tostring(low[highestBarOffset], format.mintick)
    // Update the label's position, text and tooltip.
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index[highestBarOffset], hi)
    label.set_text(lbl, labelText)
    label.set_tooltip(lbl, tooltipText)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-CreatingLabels-02.CaxmDfMG_1vmoqQ.png)

Note that:

- We create the label on the first bar only by using the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword to declare the `lbl` variable that contains the label's ID.
  The `x`, `y` and `text` arguments in that
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  call are irrelevant, as the label will be updated on further bars.
  We do, however, take care to use the `color` and `style` we want for
  the labels, so they don't need updating later.
- On every bar, we detect if a new high was found by testing for
  changes in the value of `hi`
- When a change in the high value occurs, we update our label with new
  information. To do this, we use three `label.set*()` calls to change
  the label's relevant information. We refer to our label using the
  `lbl` variable, which contains our label's ID. The script is thus
  maintaining the same label throughout all bars, but moving it and
  updating its information when a new high is detected.

Here we create a label on each bar, but we set its properties
conditionally, depending on the bar's polarity:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
lbl = label.new(bar_index, na)
if close >= open
    label.set_text( lbl, "green")
    label.set_color(lbl, color.green)
    label.set_yloc( lbl, yloc.belowbar)
    label.set_style(lbl, label.style_label_up)
else
    label.set_text( lbl, "red")
    label.set_color(lbl, color.red)
    label.set_yloc( lbl, yloc.abovebar)
    label.set_style(lbl, label.style_label_down)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-CreatingLabels-03.ClglPmUL_Z1Jm6jL.png)

### [Positioning labels](https://www.tradingview.com#positioning-labels)

Labels are positioned on the chart according to *x* (bars) and *y*
(price) coordinates. Five parameters affect this behavior: `x`, `y`,
`xloc`, `yloc` and `style`:

`x`

Is either a bar index or a time value. When a bar index is used, the
value can be offset in the past or in the future (maximum of 500
bars in the future). Past or future offsets can also be calculated
when using time values. The `x` value of an existing label can be
modified using
[label.set_x()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_x)
or
[label.set_xy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_xy).

`xloc`

Is either
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_index)
(the default) or
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_time).
It determines which type of argument must be used with `x`. With
[xloc.bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_index),
`x` must be an absolute bar index. With
[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_time),
`x` must be a UNIX time in milliseconds corresponding to the
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
value of a bar's
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open).
The `xloc` value of an existing label can be modified using
[label.set_xloc()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_xloc).

`y`

Is the price level where the label is positioned. It is only taken
into account with the default `yloc` value of `yloc.price`. If
`yloc` is
[yloc.abovebar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dabovebar)
or
[yloc.belowbar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dbelowbar)
then the `y` argument is ignored. The `y` value of an existing label
can be modified using
[label.set_y()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_y)
or
[label.set_xy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_xy).

`yloc`

Can be
[yloc.price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dprice)
(the default),
[yloc.abovebar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dabovebar)
or
[yloc.belowbar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dbelowbar).
The argument used for `y` is only taken into account with
[yloc.price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dprice).
The `yloc` value of an existing label can be modified using
[label.set_yloc()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_yloc).

`style`

The argument used has an impact on the visual appearance of the
label and on its position relative to the reference point determined
by either the `y` value or the top/bottom of the bar when
[yloc.abovebar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dabovebar)
or
[yloc.belowbar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_yloc%7Bdot%7Dbelowbar)
are used. The `style` of an existing label can be modified using
[label.set_style()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_style).

These are the available `style` arguments:

[xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc%7Bdot%7Dbar_time),
the `x` value must be a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds. See the page on
[Time](#time) for more information.
The start time of the current bar can be obtained from the
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
built-in variable. The bar time of previous bars is `time[1]`, `time[2]`
and so on. Time can also be set to an absolute value with the
[timestamp](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp)
function. You may add or subtract periods of time to achieve relative
time offset.

Let's position a label one day ago from the date on the last bar:

```
//@version=6
indicator("")
daysAgoInput = input.int(1, tooltip = "Use negative values to offset in the future")
if barstate.islast
    MS_IN_ONE_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
    oneDayAgo = time - (daysAgoInput * MS_IN_ONE_DAY)
    label.new(oneDayAgo, high, xloc = xloc.bar_time, style = label.style_label_right)
```

Note that because of varying time gaps and missing bars when markets are
closed, the positioning of the label may not always be exact. Time
offsets of the sort tend to be more reliable on 24x7 markets.

You can also offset using a bar index for the `x` value, e.g.:

```
label.new(bar_index + 10, high)
label.new(bar_index - 10, high[10])
label.new(bar_index[10], high[10])
```

### [Reading label properties](https://www.tradingview.com#reading-label-properties)

The following *getter* functions are available for labels:

- [label.get_x()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dget_x)
- [label.get_y()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dget_y)
- [label.get_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dget_text)

They all have a similar signature. The one for
[label.get_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dget_text)
is:

```
label.get_text(id) → series string
```

where `id` is the label whose text is to be retrieved.

### [Cloning labels](https://www.tradingview.com#cloning-labels)

The
[label.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dcopy)
function is used to clone labels. Its syntax is:

```
label.copy(id) → void
```

### [Deleting labels](https://www.tradingview.com#deleting-labels)

The
[label.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Ddelete)
function is used to delete labels. Its syntax is:

```
label.delete(id) → void
```

To keep only a user-defined quantity of labels on the chart, one could
use code like this:

```
//@version=6
MAX_LABELS = 500
indicator("", max_labels_count = MAX_LABELS)
qtyLabelsInput = input.int(5, "Labels to keep", minval = 0, maxval = MAX_LABELS)
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
if myRSI > ta.highest(myRSI, 20)[1]
    label.new(bar_index, myRSI, str.tostring(myRSI, "#.00"), style = label.style_none)
    if array.size(label.all) > qtyLabelsInput
        label.delete(array.get(label.all, 0))
plot(myRSI)
```

![image](images/TextAndShapes-DeletingLabels-01.CQiqGcEC_ZRD1mW.png)

Note that:

- We define a `MAX_LABELS` constant to hold the maximum quantity of
  labels a script can accommodate. We use that value to set the
  `max_labels_count` parameter's value in our
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  call, and also as the `maxval` value in our
  [input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dint)
  call to cap the user value.
- We create a new label when our RSI breaches its highest value of the
  last 20 bars. Note the offset of `[1]` we use in
  `if myRSI > ta.highest(myRSI, 20)[1]`. This is necessary. Without
  it, the value returned by
  [ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dhighest)
  would always include the current value of `myRSI`, so `myRSI` would
  never be higher than the function's return value.
- After that, we delete the oldest label in the
  [label.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_label%7Bdot%7Dall)
  array that is automatically maintained by the Pine Script™ runtime
  and contains the ID of all the visible labels drawn by our script.
  We use the
  [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dget)
  function to retrieve the array element at index zero (the oldest
  visible label ID). We then use
  [label.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Ddelete)
  to delete the label linked with that ID.

Note that if one wants to position a label on the last bar only, it is
unnecessary and inefficent to create and delete the label as the script
executes on all bars, so that only the last label remains:

```
// INEFFICENT!
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
lbl = label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
label.delete(lbl[1])
```

This is the efficient way to realize the same task:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
if barstate.islast
    // Create the label once, the first time the block executes on the last bar.
    var lbl = label.new(na, na)
    // On all iterations of the script on the last bar, update the label's information.
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(lbl, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
```

### [Realtime behavior](https://www.tradingview.com#realtime-behavior)

Labels are subject to both *commit* and *rollback* actions, which affect
the behavior of a script when it executes in the realtime bar. See the
page on Pine Script™'s
[Execution model](#execution-model).

This script demonstrates the effect of rollback when running in the
realtime bar:

```
//@version=6
indicator("", "", true)
label.new(bar_index, high)
```

On realtime bars,
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
creates a new label on every script update, but because of the rollback
process, the label created on the previous update on the same bar is
deleted. Only the last label created before the realtime bar's close
will be committed, and thus persist.

## [Text formatting](https://www.tradingview.com#text-formatting)

Drawing objects like [labels](#labels), [tables](#tables), and [boxes](#boxes) have text-related properties that allow users to customize how an object's text appears on the chart. Some common properties include the text color, size, font family, and typographic emphasis.

Programmers can set an object's text properties when initializing it using the [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new), [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new), or [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell) parameters. Alternatively, they can use the corresponding setter functions, e.g., [label.set_text_font_family()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.set_text_font_family), [table.cell_set_text_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell_set_text_color), [box.set_text_halign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_text_halign), etc.

All three drawing objects have a `text_formatting` parameter, which sets the typographic emphasis to display **bold**, *italicized*, or unformatted text. It accepts the constants [text.format_bold](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_bold), [text.format_italic](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_italic), or [text.format_none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_none) (no special formatting; default value). It also accepts `text.format_bold + text.format_italic` to display text that is both ***bold and italicized***.

The `size` parameter in [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) and the `text_size` parameter in [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new) and [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell) specify the size of the text displayed in the drawn objects. The parameters accept both "string" `size.*` constants and "int" typographic sizes. A "string" `size.*` constant represents one of six fixed sizing options. An "int" size value can be any positive integer, allowing scripts to replicate the `size.*` values or use other customized sizing.

This table lists the `size.*` constants and their equivalent "int" sizes for [tables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell), [boxes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new), and [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new):

The `closeLabel` text size is a [user-selected](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.string) "string" `size.*` constant, while the `barMoveTable` text size is a [user-selected](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int) "int" value. The script also draws a [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new) of the [highest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)-[lowest](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.lowest) price range for the last 20 bars to assess the current price's position. Two "bool" [inputs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.bool) for "Bold" and "Italic" emphasis set the text formatting of the label, box, and table cell collectively. Enabling both inputs displays text that is both bold and italicized, while disabling both inputs displays text with no special formatting:

    // Set the text formatting of the `closeLabel`, `barMoveTable` cell, and `rangeBox` objects.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Time

# [Time](https://www.tradingview.com#time)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

In Pine Script™, the following key aspects apply when working with date and time values:

- **UNIX timestamp**: The native format for time values in Pine, representing the absolute number of *milliseconds* elapsed since midnight [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) on 1970-01-01. Several built-ins return UNIX timestamps directly, which users can [format](#formatting-dates-and-times) into readable dates and times. See the [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) section below for more information.
- **Exchange time zone**: The [time zone](#time-zones) of the instrument's exchange. All [calendar-based variables](#calendar-based-variables) hold values expressed in the exchange time zone, and all built-in function overloads that have a `timezone` parameter use this time zone by default.
- **Chart time zone**: The time zone the chart and [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) message prefixes use to express time values. Users can set the chart time zone using the "Timezone" input in the "Symbol" tab of the chart's settings. This setting only changes the *display* of dates and times on the chart and the times that prefix logged messages. It does **not** affect the behavior of Pine scripts because they cannot access a chart's time zone information.
- **`timezone` parameter**: A "string" parameter of time-related functions that specifies the time zone used in their calculations. For [calendar-based functions](#calendar-based-functions), such as [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), the `timezone` parameter determines the time zone of the returned value. For functions that return UNIX timestamps, such as [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time), the specified `timezone` defines the time zone of other applicable parameters, e.g., `session`. See the [Time zone strings](#time-zone-strings) section to learn more.

## [UNIX timestamps](https://www.tradingview.com#unix-timestamps)

[UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) is a standardized date and time representation that measures the number of *non-leap seconds* elapsed since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (the *UNIX Epoch*), typically expressed in seconds or smaller time units. A UNIX time value in Pine Script™ is an "int" *timestamp* representing the number of *milliseconds* from the UNIX Epoch to a specific point in time.

Because a UNIX timestamp represents the number of consistent time units elapsed from a fixed historical point (epoch), its value is **time zone-agnostic**. A UNIX timestamp in Pine always corresponds to the same distinct point in time, accurate to the millisecond, regardless of a user's location.

For example, the UNIX timestamp `1723472500000` always represents the time 1,723,472,500,000 milliseconds (1,723,472,500 seconds) after the UNIX Epoch. This timestamp's meaning does **not** change relative to any [time zone](#time-zones).

To *format* an "int" UNIX timestamp into a readable date/time "string" expressed in a specific time zone, use the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function. The function does not *modify* UNIX timestamps. It simply *represents* timestamps in a desired human-readable format.

For instance, the function can represent the UNIX timestamp `1723472500000` as a "string" in several ways, depending on its `format` and `timezone` arguments, without changing the *absolute* point in time that it refers to. The simple script below calculates three valid representations of this timestamp and displays them in the [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane:

![image](images/Time-Unix-timestamps-1.CTbXturQ_ZA7lsx.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("UNIX timestamps demo")

//@variable A UNIX time value representing the specific point 1,723,472,500,000 ms after the UNIX Epoch. 
int unixTimestamp = 1723472500000

// These are a few different ways to express the `unixTimestamp` in a relative, human-readable format.
// Despite their format and time zone differences, all the calculated strings represent the SAME distinct point: 
string isoExchange  = str.format_time(unixTimestamp)
string utcDateTime  = str.format_time(unixTimestamp, "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss.S", "UTC+0")
string utc4TimeDate = str.format_time(unixTimestamp, "hh:mm:ss a, MMMM dd, yyyy z", "UTC+4")

// Log the `unixTimestamp` and the custom "string" representations on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    log.info(
         "\nUNIX time (ms): {0, number, #}\n
         ISO 8601 representation (Exchange time zone): {1}\n
         Custom date and time representation (UTC+0 time zone): {2}\n
         Custom time and date representation (UTC+4 time zone): {3}",
         unixTimestamp, isoExchange, utcDateTime, utc4TimeDate
     )
```

Note that:

- The value enclosed within square brackets in the logged message is an *automatic* prefix representing the historical time of the [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info) call in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, expressed in the [chart time zone](#time-zones).

See the [Formatting dates and times](#formatting-dates-and-times) section to learn more about representing UNIX timestamps with formatted strings.

## [Time zones](https://www.tradingview.com#time-zones)

A [time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone) is a geographic region with an assigned *local time*. The specific time within a time zone is consistent throughout the region. Time zone boundaries typically relate to a location's longitude. However, in practice, they tend to align with administrative boundaries rather than strictly following longitudinal lines.

The local time within a time zone depends on its defined *offset* from [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time), which can range from UTC-12:00 (12 hours *behind* UTC) to UTC+14:00 (14 hours *ahead* of UTC). Some regions maintain a consistent offset from UTC, and others have an offset that changes over time due to [daylight saving time (DST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) and other factors.

Two primary time zones apply to data feeds and TradingView charts: the *exchange time zone* and the *chart time zone*.

The exchange time zone represents the time zone of the current symbol's *exchange*, which Pine scripts can access with the [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) variable. [Calendar-based variables](#calendar-based-variables), such as [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month), [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek), and [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour), always hold values expressed in the exchange time zone, and all time function overloads that have a `timezone` parameter use this time zone by default.

The chart time zone is a *visual preference* that defines how the chart and the time prefixes of [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) represent time values. To set the chart time zone, use the "Timezone" input in the "Symbol" tab of the chart's settings or click on the current time shown below the chart. The specified time zone does **not** affect time calculations in Pine scripts because they cannot access this chart information. Although scripts cannot access a chart's time zone, programmers can provide [inputs](#inputs) that users can adjust to match the time zone.

For example, the script below uses [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) to represent the [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) of the last historical bar's [opening time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [closing time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) as date-time strings, expressed in the function's default time zone, the exchange time zone, UTC-0, and a user-specified time zone. It displays all four representations for comparison within a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) in the bottom-right corner of the chart:

![image](images/Time-Time-zones-1.BAv9QYBX_jNyY.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Time zone comparison demo", overlay = true) 

//@variable The time zone of the time values in the last table row. 
//          The "string" can contain either UTC offset notation or an IANA time zone identifier. 
string timezoneInput = input.string("UTC+4:00", "Time zone")

//@variable A `table` showing strings representing bar times in three preset time zones and a custom time zone. 
var table displayTable = table.new(
     position.bottom_right, columns = 3, rows = 5, border_color = chart.fg_color, border_width = 2
 )

//@function Initializes three `displayTable` cells on the `row` that show the `title`, `text1`, and `text2` strings. 
tableRow(int row, string title, string text1, string text2, color titleColor = #9b27b066, color infoColor = na) =>
    displayTable.cell(0, row, title, bgcolor = titleColor, text_color = chart.fg_color)
    displayTable.cell(1, row, text1, bgcolor = infoColor,  text_color = chart.fg_color)
    displayTable.cell(2, row, text2, bgcolor = infoColor,  text_color = chart.fg_color)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Draw an empty label to signify the bar that the displayed time strings represent.
    label.new(bar_index, high, color = #9b27b066, size = size.huge)

    //@variable The formatting string for all `str.format_time()` calls. Sets the format of the date-time strings. 
    var string formatString = "yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ss"
    // Initialize a header row at the top of the `displayTable`.
    tableRow(0, "", "OPEN time", "CLOSE time", na, #9b27b066)
    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the default time zone (no specified `timezone` arguments).
    tableRow(1, "Default", str.format_time(time, formatString), str.format_time(time_close, formatString))
    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the exchange time zone (`syminfo.timezone`).
    tableRow(2, "Exchange: " + syminfo.timezone, 
         str.format_time(time, formatString, syminfo.timezone),
         str.format_time(time_close, formatString, syminfo.timezone)
     )  
    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the UTC-0 time zone (using "UTC" as the `timezone` arguments).
    tableRow(3, "UTC-0", str.format_time(time, formatString, "UTC"), str.format_time(time_close, formatString, "UTC"))

    // Initialize a row showing the bar's times in the custom time zone (`timezoneInput`).
    tableRow(
         4, "Custom: " + timezoneInput, 
         str.format_time(time, formatString, timezoneInput), 
         str.format_time(time_close, formatString, timezoneInput)
     )
```

Note that:

- The [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) on the chart signifies which bar's times the displayed strings represent.
- The "Default" and "Exchange" rows in the table show identical results because [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) is the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function's default `timezone` argument.
- The exchange time zone on our example chart appears as `"America/New_York"`, the [IANA identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for the NASDAQ exchange's time zone. It represents UTC-4 *or* UTC-5, depending on the time of year. See the [next section](#time-zone-strings) to learn more about time zone strings.

### [Time zone strings](https://www.tradingview.com#time-zone-strings)

All built-in functions with a `timezone` parameter accept a "string" argument specifying the [time zone](#time-zones) they use in their calculations. These functions can accept time zone strings in either of the following formats:

- **UTC** (or *GMT*) offset notation, e.g., `"UTC-5"`, `"UTC+05:30"`, `"GMT+0100"`
- **IANA database** notation, e.g., `"America/New_York"`, `"Asia/Calcutta"`, `"Europe/Paris"`

The [IANA time zone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) reference page lists possible time zone identifiers and their respective UTC offsets. The listed identifiers are valid as `timezone` arguments.

Note that various time zone strings expressed in UTC or IANA notation can represent the *same* offset from Coordinated Universal Time. For instance, these strings all represent a local time three hours ahead of UTC:

- `"UTC+3"`
- `"GMT+03:00"`
- `"Asia/Kuwait"`
- `"Europe/Moscow"`
- `"Africa/Nairobi"`

For the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function and the functions that calculate calendar-based values from a [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps), including [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), and [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour), the "string" passed to the `timezone` parameter changes the returned value's calculation to express the result in the specified time zone. See the [Formatting dates and times](#formatting-dates-and-times) and [Calendar-based functions](#calendar-based-functions) sections for more information.

The example below shows how time zone strings affect the returned values of calendar-based functions. This script uses three [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) function calls to calculate "int" values representing the opening hour of each bar in the exchange time zone, UTC-0, and a user-specified UTC offset. It plots all three calculated hours in a separate pane for comparison:

![image](images/Time-Time-zones-Time-zone-strings-1.CWMAwPYS_ZN7mN7.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Time zone strings in calendar functions demo")

//@variable An "int" representing the user-specified hourly offset from UTC. 
int utcOffsetInput = input.int(defval = 4, title ="Timezone offset UTC (+/-)", minval = -12, maxval = 14)

//@variable A valid time zone string based on the `utcOffsetInput`, in UTC offset notation (e.g., "UTC-4").
string customOffset = "UTC" + (utcOffsetInput > 0 ? "+" : "") + str.tostring(utcOffsetInput)

//@variable The bar's opening hour in the exchange time zone (default). Equivalent to the `hour` variable.
int exchangeHour = hour(time)
//@variable The bar's opening hour in the "UTC-0" time zone. 
int utcHour = hour(time, "UTC-0")
//@variable The bar's opening hour in the `customOffset` time zone.
int customOffsetHour = hour(time, customOffset)

// Plot the `exchangeHour`, `utcHour`, and `customOffsetHour` for comparison.
plot(exchangeHour,     "Exchange hour",      #E100FF5B,    8)
plot(utcHour,          "UTC-0 hour",         color.blue,   3)
plot(customOffsetHour, "Custom offset hour", color.orange, 3)
```

Note that:

- The `exchangeHour` value is four *or* five hours behind the `utcHour` because the NASDAQ exchange is in the "America/New_York" time zone. This time zone has a UTC offset that *changes* during the year due to daylight saving time (DST). The script's default `customOffsetHour` is consistently four hours ahead of the `utcHour` because its time zone is UTC+4.
- The call to the [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) function without a specified `timezone` argument returns the same value that the [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour)*variable* holds because both represent the bar's opening hour in the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).

For functions that return [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) directly, such as [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp), the `timezone` parameter defines the time zone of the function's calendar-based *parameters*, including `session`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. The parameter does *not* determine the time zone of the returned value, as UNIX timestamps are *time zone-agnostic*. See the [Testing for sessions](#testing-for-sessions) and [`timestamp()`](#timestamp) sections to learn more.

The following script calls the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function to calculate the UNIX timestamp of a specific date and time, and it draws a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) at the timestamp's corresponding bar location. The user-selected `timezone` argument (`timezoneInput`) determines the time zone of the call's calendar-based arguments. Consequently, the calculated timestamp varies with the `timezoneInput` value because identical local times in various time zones correspond to *different* amounts of time elapsed since the [UNIX Epoch](#unix-timestamps):

![image](images/Time-Time-zones-Time-zone-strings-2.Bgcl5BRA_Z1UUd3e.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Time zone strings in UNIX timestamp functions demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The `timezone` argument of the `timestamp()` call, which sets the time zone of all date and time parameters.
string timezoneInput = input.string("Etc/UTC", "Time zone")

//@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to a specific calendar date and time.
//          The specified `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second` represent calendar values in the 
//          `timezoneInput` time zone. 
//          Different `timezone` arguments produce different UNIX timestamps because an identical date in another 
//          time zone does NOT represent the same absolute point in time.
int unixTimestamp = timestamp(
     timezone = timezoneInput, year = 2024, month = 10, day = 31, hour = 0, minute = 0, second = 0
 )

//@variable The `close` value when the bar's opening time crosses the `unixTimestamp`.
float labelPrice = ta.valuewhen(ta.cross(time, unixTimestamp), close, 0)

// On the last historical bar, draw a label showing the `unixTimestamp` value at the corresponding bar location.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    label.new(
         unixTimestamp, nz(labelPrice, close), "UNIX timestamp: " + str.tostring(unixTimestamp), 
         xloc.bar_time, yloc.price, chart.fg_color, label.style_label_down, chart.bg_color, size.large
     )
```

Note that:

- `"Etc/UTC"` is the *IANA identifier* for the UTC+0 time zone.
- The [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) call uses [xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc.bar_time) as its `xloc` argument, which is required to anchor the drawing to an absolute time value. Without this argument, the function treats the `unixTimestamp` as a relative bar index, leading to an incorrect location.
- The label's `y` value is the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) of the bar where the [opening time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) crosses the `unixTimestamp`. If the timestamp represents a future time, the label uses the last historical bar's price.

Although time zone strings can use either UTC or IANA notation, we recommend using *IANA notation* for `timezone` arguments in most cases, especially if a script's time calculations must align with the observed time offset in a specific country or subdivision. When a time function call uses an [IANA time zone identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for its `timezone` argument, its calculations adjust automatically for historical and future changes to the specified region's observed time, such as daylight saving time (DST) and updates to time zone boundaries, instead of using a fixed offset from UTC.

The following script demonstrates how UTC and IANA time zone strings can affect time calculations differently. It uses two calls to the [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) function to calculate the hour from the current bar's opening timestamp using `"UTC-4"` and `"America/New_York"` as `timezone` arguments. The script plots the results of both calls for comparison and colors the main pane's background when the returned values do not match. Although these two [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) calls may seem similar because UTC-4 is an observed UTC offset in New York, they *do not* always return the same results, as shown below:

![image](images/Time-Time-zones-Time-zone-strings-3.dJwwxe9V_1a20aC.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("UTC vs IANA time zone strings demo")

//@variable The hour of the current `time` in the "UTC-4" time zone. 
//          This variable's value represents the hour in New York only during DST. It is one hour ahead otherwise.
int hourUTC = hour(time, "UTC-4")
//@variable The hour of the current `time` in the "America/New_York" time zone. 
//          This form adjusts to UTC offset changes automatically, so the value always represents the hour in New York. 
int hourIANA = hour(time, "America/New_York")

//@variable Is translucent blue when `hourUTC` does not equal `hourIANA`, `na` otherwise.
color bgColor = hourUTC != hourIANA ? color.rgb(33, 149, 243, 80) : na

// Plot the values of `hourUTC` and `hourIANA` for comparison.
plot(hourUTC,  "UTC-4",            color.blue,   linewidth = 6)
plot(hourIANA, "America/New_York", color.orange, linewidth = 3)
// Highlight the main chart pane with the `bgColor`.
bgcolor(bgColor, title = "Unequal result highlight", force_overlay = true)
```

The plots in the chart above diverge periodically because New York observes daylight saving time, meaning its UTC offset *changes* at specific points in a year. During DST, New York's local time follows UTC-4. Otherwise, it follows UTC-5. Because the script's first [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour) call uses `"UTC-4"` as its `timezone` argument, it returns the correct hour in New York *only* during DST. In contrast, the call that uses the `"America/New_York"` time zone string adjusts its UTC offset automatically to return the correct hour in New York at *any* time of the year.

## [Time variables](https://www.tradingview.com#time-variables)

Pine Script™ has several built-in variables that provide scripts access to different forms of time information:

- The [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variables hold [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) representing the current bar's opening and closing times, respectively.
- The [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the starting time of the last UTC calendar day in a session.
- The [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the current time when the script executes.
- The [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year), [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month), [weekofyear](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_weekofyear), [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth), [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek), [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour), [minute](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_minute), and [second](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_second) variables reference calendar values based on the current bar's opening time, expressed in the [exchange time zone](#time-zones).
- The [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the last available bar's opening time.
- The [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) variables hold UNIX timestamps representing the opening times of the leftmost and rightmost visible chart bars.
- The [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) variable holds a "string" value representing the [time zone](#time-zones) of the current symbol's exchange in [IANA database notation](#time-zone-strings). All time-related function overloads with a `timezone` parameter use this variable as the default argument.

### [`time` and `time_close` variables](https://www.tradingview.com#time-and-time_close-variables)

The [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) variable holds the [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) of the current bar's *opening time*, and the [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variable holds the UNIX timestamp of the bar's *closing time*.

These timestamps are unique, time zone-agnostic "int" values, which programmers can use to anchor [drawing objects](#drawing-types) to specific bar times, calculate and inspect bar time differences, construct readable date/time strings with the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function, and more.

The script below displays bar opening and closing times in different ways. On each bar, it [formats](#formatting-dates-and-times) the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) timestamps into strings containing the hour, minute, and second in the [exchange time zone](#time-zones), and it draws [labels](#labels) displaying the formatted strings at the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices. Additionally, the script displays strings containing the unformatted UNIX timestamps of the last chart bar within a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) in the bottom-right corner:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Time-and-time-close-1.SQRlfJYt_Z2oHBgb.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`time` and `time_close` demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable A "string" representing the hour, minute, and second of the bar's opening time in the exchange time zone. 
string openTimeString = str.format_time(time, "HH:mm:ss")
//@variable A "string" representing the hour, minute, and second of the bar's closing time in the exchange time zone.
string closeTimeString = str.format_time(time_close, "HH:mm:ss")

//@variable Is `label.style_label_down` when the `open` is higher than `close`, `label.style_label_up` otherwise.
string openLabelStyle  = open > close ? label.style_label_down : label.style_label_up
//@variable Is `label.style_label_down` when the `close` is higher than `open`, `label.style_label_up` otherwise.
string closeLabelStyle = close > open ? label.style_label_down : label.style_label_up

// Draw labels anchored to the bar's `time` to display the `openTimeString` and `closeTimeString`.
label.new(time, open,  openTimeString,  xloc.bar_time, yloc.price, color.orange, openLabelStyle,  color.white)
label.new(time, close, closeTimeString, xloc.bar_time, yloc.price, color.blue,   closeLabelStyle, color.white)

if barstate.islast
    //@variable A `table` displaying the last bar's *unformatted* UNIX timestamps. 
    var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 2, 2, bgcolor = #ffe70d)
    // Populate the `t` table with "string" representations of the the "int" `time` and `time_close` values. 
    t.cell(0, 0, "`time`")
    t.cell(1, 0, str.tostring(time))
    t.cell(0, 1, "`time_close`")
    t.cell(1, 1, str.tostring(time_close))
```

Note that:

- This script's [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) calls include [xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_xloc.bar_time) as the `xloc` argument and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) as the `x` argument to anchor the drawings to bar opening times.
- The formatted strings express time in the exchange time zone because we did not specify `timezone` arguments in the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) calls. NYSE, our chart symbol's exchange, is in the "America/New_York" time zone (UTC-4/-5).
- Although our example chart uses an *hourly* timeframe, the [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) and the [labels](#labels) at the end of the chart show that the last bar closes only *30 minutes* (1,800,000 milliseconds) after opening. This behavior occurs because the chart aligns bars with [session](#sessions) opening and closing times. A session's final bar closes when the session ends, and a new bar opens when a new session starts. A typical session on our 60-minute chart with regular trading hours (RTH) spans from 09:30 to 16:00 (6.5 hours). The chart divides this interval into as many 60-minute bars as possible, starting from the session's opening time, which leaves only 30 minutes for the final bar to cover.

It's crucial to note that unlike the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) variable, which has consistent behavior across chart types, [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) behaves differently on *time-based* and *non-time-based* charts.

Time-based charts have bars that typically open and close at regular, *predictable* times within a session. Thanks to this predictability, [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) can accurately represent the *expected* closing time of an open bar on a time-based chart, as shown on the last bar in the example above.

In contrast, the bars on [tick charts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000709225/) and *price-based* charts (all [non-standard charts](#non-standard-charts-data) excluding [Heikin Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000619436/)) cover *irregular* time intervals. Tick charts construct bars based on successive ticks in the data feed, and price-based charts construct bars based on significant price movements. The time it takes for new ticks or price changes to occur is *unpredictable*. As such, the [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) value is [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on the *realtime bars* of these charts.

The following script uses the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variables with [str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring) and [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) to create strings containing bar opening and closing [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) and [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) date-time representations, which it displays in [labels](#labels) at each bar's [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) prices.

When applied to a [Renko](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502284/) chart, which forms new bars based on *price movements*, the labels show correct results on all historical bars. However, the last bar has a [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) value of [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) because the future closing time is unpredictable. Consequently, the bar's closing time label shows a timestamp of `"NaN"` and an *incorrect* date and time:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Time-and-time-close-2.DgbsHPgj_1bCOHq.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`time_close` on non-time-based chart demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A formatted "string" containing the date and time that `time_close` represents in the exchange time zone.

//@variable A formatted "string" containing the date and time that `time` represents in the exchange time zone.
string formattedOpenTime = str.format_time(time, format = "'Date and time:' yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

//@variable A "string" containing the `time_close` UNIX timestamp and the `formattedCloseTime`.
string closeTimeText = str.format("Close timestamp: {0,number,#}\n{1}", time_close, formattedCloseTime)
//@variable A "string" containing the `time` UNIX timestamp and the `formattedOpenTime`.
string openTimeText = str.format("Open timestamp: {0,number,#}\n{1}", time, formattedOpenTime)

// Define label colors for historical and realtime bars. 
color closeLabelColor = barstate.islast ? color.purple : color.aqua
color openLabelColor  = barstate.islast ? color.green  : color.orange

// Draw a label at the `high` to display the `closeTimeText` and a label at the `low` to display the `openTimeText`, 
// both anchored to the bar's `time`. 
label.new(
      time, high, closeTimeText, xloc.bar_time, color = closeLabelColor, textcolor = color.white, 
      size = size.large, textalign = text.align_left
 )
label.new(
      time, low, openTimeText, xloc.bar_time, color = openLabelColor, style = label.style_label_up, 
      size = size.large, textcolor = color.white, textalign = text.align_left
 )

// Highlight the background yellow on the latest bar. 
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? #f3de22cb : na, title = "Latest bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- The script draws up to 50 [labels](#labels) because we did not specify a `max_labels_count` argument in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration statement.
- The [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function replaces [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values with 0 in its calculations, which is why it returns an incorrect date-time "string" on the last bar. A timestamp of 0 corresponds to the *UNIX Epoch* (00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970). However, the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) call does not specify a `timezone` argument, so it expresses the epoch's date and time in the *exchange time zone*, which was five hours behind UTC at that point in time.
- The [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) function, which returns the closing timestamp of a bar on a specified timeframe within a given session, also returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on the realtime bars of tick-based and price-based charts.

### [`time_tradingday`](https://www.tradingview.com#time_tradingday)

The [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) variable holds a [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) representing the starting time (00:00 UTC) of the last trading day in the current bar's final session. It is helpful primarily for date and time calculations on *time-based* charts for symbols with overnight sessions that start and end on *different* calendar days.

On "1D" and lower timeframes, the [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) timestamp corresponds to the beginning of the day when the current session *ends*, even for bars that open and close on the previous day. For example, the "Monday" session for "EURUSD" starts on Sunday at 17:00 and ends on Monday at 17:00 in the [exchange time zone](#time-zones). The [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) values of *all* intraday bars within the session represent Monday at 00:00 UTC.

On timeframes higher than "1D", which can cover *multiple* sessions, [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) holds the timestamp representing the beginning of the last calendar day of the bar's *final* trading session. For example, on a "EURUSD, 1W" chart, the timestamp represents the start of the last trading day in the week, which is typically Friday at 00:00 UTC.

The script below demonstrates how the [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) variables differ on Forex symbols. On each bar, it draws [labels](#labels) to display strings containing the variables' [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) and [formatted dates and times](#formatting-dates-and-times). It also uses the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) function to calculate the UTC calendar day from both timestamps, highlighting the background when the calculated days do not match.

When applied to the "FXCM:EURUSD" chart with the "3h" ("180") timeframe, the script highlights the background of the *first bar* in each session, as each session opens on the *previous* calendar day. The [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) call that uses [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) calculates the opening day on the session's first bar, whereas the call that uses [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) calculates the day when the session *ends*:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Time-tradingday-1.oi6pPbd1_Z2d200U.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`time_tradingday` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A concatenated "string" containing the `time_tradingday` timestamp and a formatted representation in UTC.
string tradingDayText = "`time_tradingday`: " + str.tostring(time_tradingday) + "\n"

//@variable Is `true` on every even bar, `false` otherwise. This condition determines the appearance of the labels. 
bool isEven = bar_index % 2 == 0

// The `yloc` and `style` properties of the labels. They alternate on every other bar for visibility. 
labelYloc  = isEven ? yloc.abovebar : yloc.belowbar
labelStyle = isEven ? label.style_label_down : label.style_label_up
// Draw alternating labels anchored to the bar's `time` to display the `tradingDayText` and `barOpenText`.
if isEven
    label.new(time, 0, tradingDayText + "\n\n\n", xloc.bar_time, labelYloc, color.teal, labelStyle, color.white)
    label.new(time, 0, barOpenText, xloc.bar_time, labelYloc, color.maroon, labelStyle, color.white)
else
    label.new(time, 0, "\n\n\n" + barOpenText, xloc.bar_time, labelYloc, color.maroon, labelStyle, color.white)
    label.new(time, 0, tradingDayText, xloc.bar_time, labelYloc, color.teal, labelStyle, color.white)

//@variable The day of the month, in UTC, that the `time_tradingday` timestamp corresponds to. 
int tradingDayOfMonth = dayofmonth(time_tradingday, "UTC+0")
//@variable The day of the month, in UTC, that the `time` timestamp corresponds to. 
int openingDayOfMonth = dayofmonth(time, "UTC+0")

// Highlight the background when the `tradingDayOfMonth` does not equal the `openingDayOfMonth`. 
bgcolor(tradingDayOfMonth != openingDayOfMonth ? color.rgb(174, 89, 243, 85) : na, title = "Different day highlight")
```

Note that:

- The [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) and [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) calls use `"UTC+0"` as the `timezone` argument, meaning the results represent calendar time values with no offset from UTC. In the screenshot, the first bar opens at 21:00 UTC, 17:00 in the exchange time zone ("America/New_York").
- The formatted strings show `"GMT"` as the acronym of the time zone, which is equivalent to `"UTC+0"` in this context.
- The [time_tradingday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_tradingday) value is the same for *all* three-hour bars within each session, even for the initial bar that opens on the previous UTC calendar day. The assigned timestamp changes only when a new session starts.

### [`timenow`](https://www.tradingview.com#timenow)

The [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) variable holds a [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) representing the script's *current time*. Unlike the values of other variables that hold UNIX timestamps, the values in the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) series correspond to times when the script *executes*, not the times of specific bars or trading days.

A Pine script executes only *once* per historical bar, and all historical executions occur when the script first *loads* on the chart. As such, the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) value is relatively consistent on historical bars, with only occasional millisecond changes across the series. In contrast, on realtime bars, a script executes once for *each new update* in the data feed, which can happen several times per bar. With each new execution, the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) value updates on the latest bar to represent the current time.

This variable is most useful on realtime bars, where programmers can apply it to track the times of the latest script executions, count the time elapsed within open bars, control drawings based on bar updates, and more.

The script below inspects the value of [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) on the latest chart bars and uses it to analyze realtime bar updates. When the script first reaches the last chart bar, it declares three variables with the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword to hold the latest [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) value, the total time elapsed between the bar's updates, and the total number of updates. It uses these values to calculate the average number of milliseconds between updates, which it displays in a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) along with the current execution's timestamp, a [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) time and date in the [exchange time zone](#time-zones), and the current number of bar updates:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Timenow-1.OYWKIkvY_Z1MUwEq.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`timenow` demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

if barstate.islast
    //@variable Holds the UNIX timestamp of the latest script execution for timing updates in the data feed. 
    varip int lastUpdateTimestamp = timenow
    //@variable The total number of milliseconds elapsed across the bar's data updates.
    varip int totalUpdateTime = 0
    //@variable The number of updates that have occurred on the current bar.
    varip int numUpdates = 0

    // Add the time elapsed from the `lastUpdateTimestamp` to `totalUpdateTime`, increase the `numUpdates` counter, and 
    // update the `lastUpdateTimestamp` when the `timenow` value changes.
    if timenow != lastUpdateTimestamp
        totalUpdateTime     += timenow - lastUpdateTimestamp
        numUpdates          += 1
        lastUpdateTimestamp := timenow

    //@variable The average number of milliseconds elapsed between the bar's updates.
    float avgUpdateTime = nz(totalUpdateTime / numUpdates)

    //@variable Contains the `timenow` value, a custom representation, and the `numUpdates` and `avgUpdateTime` values.
    string displayText = "`timenow`: " + str.tostring(timenow)
                         + "\nTime and date (exchange): " + str.format_time(timenow, "HH:mm:ss MM/dd/yy")
                         + "\nNumber of updates: " + str.tostring(numUpdates)
                         + "\nAvg. time between updates: " + str.tostring(avgUpdateTime, "#.###") + " ms"

    //@variable The color of the label. Is blue when the bar is open, and gray after it closes. 
    color labelColor = barstate.isconfirmed ? color.gray : color.blue 
    //@variable The label's y-coordinate. Alternates between `high` and `low` on every other bar. 
    float labelPrice = bar_index % 2 == 0 ? high : low
    //@variable The label's style. Alternates between "lower-right" and "upper-right" styles.
    labelStyle = bar_index % 2 == 0 ? label.style_label_lower_right : label.style_label_upper_right  
    // Draw a `labelColor` label anchored to the bar's `time` to show the `displayText`.
    label.new(
         time, labelPrice, displayText, xloc.bar_time, color = labelColor, style = labelStyle, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.large
     ) 

    // Reset the `totalUpdateTime` and `numUpdates` counters when the bar is confirmed (closes). 
    if barstate.isconfirmed
        totalUpdateTime := 0
        numUpdates      := 0
```

Note that:

- When a bar is unconfirmed (open), the [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) is blue to signify that additional updates can occur. After the bar is [confirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isconfirmed) (closed), the label turns gray.
- Although we've set the chart [time zone](#time-zones) to match the exchange time zone, the formatted time in the open bar's [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) and the time shown below the chart *do not* always align. The script records a new timestamp *only* when a new execution occurs, whereas the time below the chart updates *continuously*.
- The [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword specifies that a variable does not revert to the last committed value in its series when new updates occur. This behavior allows the script to use variables to track changes in [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) on an open bar.
- Updates to [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) on open realtime bars do not affect the recorded timestamps on confirmed bars as the script executes. However, the historical series changes (*repaints*) after reloading the chart because [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) references the script's *current time*, not the times of specific bars.

### [Calendar-based variables](https://www.tradingview.com#calendar-based-variables)

The [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year), [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month), [weekofyear](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_weekofyear), [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth), [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek), [hour](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hour), [minute](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_minute), and [second](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_second) variables hold *calendar-based* "int" values calculated from the current bar's *opening time*, expressed in the [exchange time zone](#time-zones). These variables reference the same values that [calendar-based functions](#calendar-based-functions) return when they use the default `timezone` argument and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) as the `time` argument. For instance, the [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year) variable holds the same value that a [year(time)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_year) call returns.

Programmers can use these calendar-based variables for several purposes, such as:

- Identifying a bar's opening date and time.
- Passing the variables to the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function to calculate [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps).
- Testing when date/time values or ranges occur in a data feed.

One of the most common use cases for these variables is checking for date or time ranges to control when a script displays visuals or executes calculations. This simple example inspects the [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year) variable to determine when to plot a visible value. If the [year](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_year) is 2022 or higher, the script plots the bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close). Otherwise, it plots [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na):

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Calendar-based-variables-1.kYa8Z75h_KDMyu.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`year` demo", overlay = true)

// Plot the `close` price on bars that open in the `year` 2022 onward. Otherwise, plot `na` to display nothing.
plot(year >= 2022 ? close : na, "`close` price (year 2022 and later)", linewidth = 3)
```

When using these variables in conditions that isolate specific dates or times rather than ranges, it's crucial to consider that certain conditions might not detect some occurrences of the values due to a chart's timeframe, the opening times of chart bars, or the symbol's active session.

For instance, suppose we want to detect when the first calendar day of each month occurs on the chart. Intuitively, one might consider simply checking when the [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth) value equals 1. However, this condition only identifies when a bar *opens* on a month's first day. The bars on some charts can open and close in *different* months. Additionally, a chart bar might not contain the first day of a month if the market is *closed* on that day. Therefore, we must create extra conditions that work in these scenarios to identify the first day in *any* month on the chart.

The script below uses the [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth) and [month](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_month) variables, and the [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month) function, to create three conditions that detect the first day of the month in different ways. The first condition detects if the bar opens on the first day, the second checks if the bar opens in one month and closes in another, and the third checks if the chart skips the date entirely. The script draws [labels](#labels) showing bar opening dates and highlights the background with different colors to visualize when each condition occurs:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Calendar-based-variables-2.xQSXmhyL_Zw0zRE.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Detecting the first day of the month demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable Is `true` only if the current bar opens on the first day of the month in exchange time, `false` otherwise. 
bool opensOnFirst = dayofmonth == 1
//@variable Is `true` if the bar opens in one month and closes in another, meaning its time span includes the first day.
bool containsFirst = month != month(time_close) 
//@variable Is `true` only if the bar opens in a new month and the current or previous bar does not cover the first day.
bool skipsFirst = month != month[1] and not (opensOnFirst or containsFirst[1])

//@variable The name of the current bar's opening weekday.
string weekdayName = switch dayofweek
    dayofweek.sunday    => "Sunday"
    dayofweek.monday    => "Monday"
    dayofweek.tuesday   => "Tuesday"
    dayofweek.wednesday => "Wednesday"
    dayofweek.thursday  => "Thursday"
    dayofweek.friday    => "Friday"
    dayofweek.saturday  => "Saturday"

//@variable A custom "string" representing the bar's opening date, including the weekday name. 
string openDateText = weekdayName + str.format_time(time, ", MMM d, yyyy")

// Draw a green label when the bar opens on the first day of the month. 
if opensOnFirst
    string labelText = "Bar opened on\n" + openDateText
    label.new(time, open, labelText, xloc.bar_time, color = color.green, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
// Draw a blue label when the bar opens and closes in different months. 
if containsFirst
    string labelText = "Bar includes the first day,\nbut opened on\n" + openDateText
    label.new(time, open, labelText, xloc.bar_time, color = color.blue, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
// Draw a red label when the chart skips the first day of the month. 
if skipsFirst
    string labelText = "Chart doesn't include the first day.\nBar opened on\n" + openDateText
    label.new(time, open, labelText, xloc.bar_time, color = color.red, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)

// Highlight the background when the conditions occur.
bgcolor(opensOnFirst ? color.new(color.green, 70) : na, title = "`opensOnFirst` condition highlight")
bgcolor(containsFirst ? color.new(color.blue, 70) : na, title = "`containsFirst` condition highlight")
bgcolor(skipsFirst ? color.new(color.red, 70) : na, title = "`skipsFirst` condition highlight")
```

Note that:

- The script calls the [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month) function with [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) as the `time` argument to calculate each bar's *closing* month for the `containsFirst` condition.
- The `dayofweek.*` namespace contains variables that hold each possible [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek) value, e.g., [dayofweek.sunday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_dayofweek.sunday) has a constant value of 1 and [dayofweek.saturday](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_dayofweek.saturday) has a constant value of 7. The script compares [dayofweek](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofweek) to these variables in a [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch) structure to determine the weekday name shown inside each [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label).
- To detect the *first opening time* in a monthly timeframe, not strictly the first day in a calendar month, use `ta.change(time("1M")) > 0` or `timeframe.change("1M")` instead of conditions based on these variables. See the [Testing for changes in higher timeframes](#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) section to learn more.

### [`last_bar_time`](https://www.tradingview.com#last_bar_time)

The [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) variable holds a [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) representing the *last* available bar's opening time. It is similar to [last_bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_index), which references the latest bar index. On historical bars, [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) consistently references the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value of the last bar available when the script first *loads* on the chart. The only time the variable's value updates across script executions is when a new realtime bar opens.

The following script uses the [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) variable to get the opening timestamp of the last chart bar during its execution on the [first bar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isfirst). It displays the UNIX timestamp and a [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) date and time in a single-cell [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) created only on that bar. When the script executes on the last available bar, it draws a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) showing the bar's [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value and its formatted representation for visual comparison.

As the chart below shows, both drawings display *identical* times, verifying that [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) correctly references the last bar's [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value on previous historical bars:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Last-bar-time-1.COWu3Po-_Z26jRdL.png)

    //@variable A "string" containing the `last_bar_time` UNIX timestamp and a custom date and time representation. 
    string lastBarTimeText = "`last_bar_time`: "              + str.tostring(last_bar_time) 
                             + "\nDate and time (exchange): " + str.format_time(last_bar_time, "dd/MM/yy HH:mm:ss")
    // Initialize the `displayTable` cell with the `lastBarTimeText`.
    displayTable.cell(
         0, 0, lastBarTimeText, 
         text_color = color.white, text_size = size.large, text_halign = text.align_left
     )

//@variable Is `true` only on the first occurrence of `barstate.islast`, `false` otherwise.
//          This condition occurs on the bar whose `time` the `last_bar_time` variable refers to on historical bars.
bool isInitialLastBar = barstate.islast and not barstate.islast[1]

if isInitialLastBar
    //@variable A "string" containing the last available bar's `time` value and a custom date and time representation.
    //          Matches the `lastBarTimeText` from the first bar because `last_bar_time` equals this bar's `time`.
    string openTimeText = "`time`: "                       + str.tostring(time)
                          + "\nDate and time (exchange): " + str.format_time(time, "dd/MM/yy HH:mm:ss") 
    // Draw a label anchored to the bar's `time` to display the `openTimeText`. 
    label.new(
         time, high, openTimeText, xloc.bar_time,
         color = color.purple, textcolor = color.white, size = size.large, textalign = text.align_left
     )

// Highlight the background when `isInitialLastBar` is `true` for visual reference. 
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? color.rgb(155, 39, 176, 80) : na, title = "Initial last bar highlight")
```

Note that:

- The script creates the [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) only on the *first* bar with the [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast) state because that bar's [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value is what [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) equals on all historical bars. On subsequent bars, the [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) value *updates* to represent the latest realtime bar's opening time.
- Updates to [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) on realtime bars do not affect the values on historical bars as the script executes. However, the variable's series *repaints* when the script restarts because [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time) always references the latest available bar's opening time.
- This script expresses dates using the `"dd/MM/yy"` format, meaning the two-digit day appears before the two-digit month, and the month appears before the two-digit representation of the year. See [this section](#formatting-dates-and-times) below for more information.

### [Visible bar times](https://www.tradingview.com#visible-bar-times)

The [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) variables reference the opening [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) of the chart's leftmost (first) and rightmost (last) *visible bars* on every script execution. When a script uses these variables, it responds dynamically to visible chart changes, such as users scrolling across bars or zooming in/out. Each time the visible window changes, the script *re-executes* automatically to update the variables' values on all available bars.

The example below demonstrates how the [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) variables work across script executions. The script draws [labels](#labels) anchored to the visible bars' times to display the UNIX timestamps. In addition, it draws two single-cell [tables](#tables) showing corresponding dates and times in the standard [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. The script creates these drawings only when it executes on the first bar. As the script continues to execute on subsequent bars, it identifies each bar whose [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value equals either visible bars' timestamp and colors it on the chart:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Visible-bar-times-1.Cm54dJVW_rV6wP.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Visible bar times demo", overlay = true)

// Create strings on the first chart bar that contain the first and last visible bars' UNIX timestamps.
var string leftTimestampText  = str.format("UNIX timestamp: {0,number,#}", chart.left_visible_bar_time)
var string rightTimestampText = str.format("UNIX timestamp: {0,number,#}", chart.right_visible_bar_time)
// Create strings on the first bar that contain the exchange date and time of the visible bars in ISO 8601 format.
var string leftDateTimeText  = "Date and time: " + str.format_time(chart.left_visible_bar_time)
var string rightDateTimeText = "Date and time: " + str.format_time(chart.right_visible_bar_time)

//@variable A `label` object anchored to the first visible bar's time. Shows the `leftTimestampText`.
var label leftTimeLabel = label.new(
     chart.left_visible_bar_time, 0, leftTimestampText, xloc.bar_time, yloc.abovebar, color.purple, 
     label.style_label_lower_left, color.white, size.large
 )
//@variable A `label` object anchored to the last visible bar's time. Shows the `rightTimestampText`.
var label rightTimeLabel = label.new(
     chart.right_visible_bar_time, 0, rightTimestampText, xloc.bar_time, yloc.abovebar, color.teal, 
     label.style_label_lower_right, color.white, size.large
 )

//@variable A single-cell `table` object showing the `leftDateTimeText`.
var table leftTimeTable = table.new(position.middle_left, 1, 1, color.purple)
//@variable A single-cell `table` object showing the `rightDateTimeText`.
var table rightTimeTable = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1, color.teal)
// On the first bar, initialize the `leftTimeTable` and `rightTimeTable` with the corresponding date-time text.
if barstate.isfirst
    leftTimeTable.cell(0, 0, leftDateTimeText, text_color = color.white, text_size = size.large)
    rightTimeTable.cell(0, 0, rightDateTimeText, text_color = color.white, text_size = size.large)

//@variable Is purple at the left visible bar's opening time, teal at the right bar's opening time, `na` otherwise. 
color barColor = switch time
    chart.left_visible_bar_time  => color.purple
    chart.right_visible_bar_time => color.teal

// Color the leftmost and rightmost visible bars using the `barColor`.
barcolor(barColor, title = "Leftmost and rightmost visible bar color")
```

Note that:

- The [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) values are consistent across all executions, which allows the script to identify the visible bars' timestamps on the *first* bar and check when the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) value equals them. The script restarts on any chart window changes, updating the variables' series to reference the new timestamps on every bar.
- The [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function uses ISO 8601 format by default when the call does not include a `format` argument because it is the *international standard* for expressing dates and times. See the [Formatting dates and times](#formatting-dates-and-times) section to learn more about time string formats.

### [`syminfo.timezone`](https://www.tradingview.com#syminfotimezone)

The [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) variable holds a [time zone string](#time-zone-strings) representing the current symbol's *exchange* time zone. The "string" value expresses the time zone as an *IANA identifier* (e.g., `"America/New_York"`). The overloads of [time functions](#time-functions) that include a `timezone` parameter use [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) as the default argument.

Because this variable is the default `timezone` argument for all applicable time function overloads, it is unnecessary to use as an explicit argument, except for stylistic purposes. However, programmers can use the variable in other ways, such as:

- Displaying the "string" in [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) or [drawings](#drawing-types) to inspect the exchange time zone's IANA identifier.
- Comparing the value to other time zone strings to create time zone-based conditional logic.
- Requesting the exchange time zones of other symbols with `request.*()` function calls.

The following script uses the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) variable to retrieve the [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) of its latest execution. It [formats](#formatting-dates-and-times) the timestamp into date-time strings expressed in the main symbol's exchange time zone and a requested symbol's exchange time zone, which it displays along with the IANA identifiers in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) on the last chart bar:

![image](images/Time-Time-variables-Syminfo-timezone-1.BAiDPB0L_Z1tzhco.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`syminfo.timezone` demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The symbol to request exchange time zone information for. 
string symbolInput = input.symbol("NSE:BANKNIFTY", "Requested symbol")

//@variable A `table` object displaying the exchange time zone and the time of the script's execution.
var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 2, 3, color.yellow, border_color = color.black, border_width = 1)

//@variable The IANA identifier of the exchange time zone requested for the `symbolInput` symbol.
var string requestedTimezone = na

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Retrieve the time zone of the user-specified symbol's exchange.
    requestedTimezone := request.security(symbolInput, "", syminfo.timezone, calc_bars_count = 2)
    // Initialize the `t` table's header cells.
    t.cell(0, 0, "Exchange prefix and time zone string", text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(1, 0, "Last execution date and time", text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(0, 1, syminfo.prefix(syminfo.tickerid) + " (" + syminfo.timezone + ")", text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(0, 2, syminfo.prefix(symbolInput) + " (" + requestedTimezone + ")", text_size = size.large)

if barstate.islast
    //@variable The formatting string for all `str.format_time()` calls. 
    var string formatString = "HH:mm:ss 'on' MMM dd, YYYY"
    // Initialize table cells to display the formatted text.
    t.cell(1, 1, str.format_time(timenow, formatString), text_size = size.large)
    t.cell(1, 2, str.format_time(timenow, formatString, requestedTimezone), text_size = size.large)
```

Note that:

- Pine scripts execute on realtime bars only when new updates occur in the data feed, and [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) updates only on script executions. As such, when no realtime updates are available, the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) timestamp does not change. See [this section](#timenow) above for more information.
- The default `symbolInput` value is `"NSE:BANKNIFTY"`. NSE is in the "Asia/Kolkata" [time zone](#time-zones), which is 9.5 hours ahead of the main symbol's exchange time zone ("America/New_York") at the time of the screenshot. Although the *local* time representations differ, both refer to the same *absolute* time that the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) timestamp represents.
- Pine v6 scripts use dynamic `request.*()` calls by default, which allows the script to call [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) dynamically inside the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) structure's *local scope*. See the [Dynamic requests](#dynamic-requests) section of the [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page to learn more.

## [Time functions](https://www.tradingview.com#time-functions)

Pine Script™ features several built-in functions that scripts can use to retrieve, calculate, and express time values:

- The [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions allow scripts to retrieve [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) for the opening and closing times of bars within a session on a specified timeframe, without requiring `request.*()` function calls.
- The [year()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_year), [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [weekofyear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_weekofyear), [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth), [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour), [minute()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_minute), and [second()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_second) functions calculate calendar-based values, expressed in a specified [time zone](#time-zones), from a UNIX timestamp.
- The [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function calculates a UNIX timestamp from a specified calendar date and time.
- The [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function formats a UNIX timestamp into a human-readable date/time "string", expressed in a specified time zone. The [Formatting dates and times](#formatting-dates-and-times) section below provides detailed information about formatting timestamps with this function.
- The [input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time) function returns a UNIX timestamp corresponding to the user-specified date and time, and the [input.session()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.session) function returns a valid [session string](#session-strings) corresponding to the user-specified start and end times. See the [Time input](#time-input) and [Session input](#session-input) sections of the [Inputs](#inputs) page to learn more about these functions.

### [`time()` and `time_close()` functions](https://www.tradingview.com#time-and-time_close-functions)

The [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions return [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) representing the opening and closing times of bars on a specified timeframe. Both functions can *filter* their returned values based on a given [session](#sessions) in a specific [time zone](#time-zones). They each have the following signatures:

```
functionName(timeframe, bars_back) → series intfunctionName(timeframe, session, bars_back) → series intfunctionName(timeframe, session, timezone, bars_back) → series int
```

Where:

- `functionName` is the function's identifier.
- The `timeframe` parameter accepts a [timeframe string](#timeframe-string-specifications). The function uses the script's main timeframe if the argument is [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) or an empty "string".
- The `session` parameter accepts a [session string](#session-strings) defining the session's start and end times (e.g., `"0930-1600"`) and the days for which it applies (e.g., `":23456"` means Monday - Friday). If the value does not specify the days, the session applies to *all* weekdays automatically. The function returns UNIX timestamps only for the bars *within* the session. It returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) if a bar's time is *outside* the session. If the `session` argument is an empty "string" or not specified, The function uses the symbol's session information.
- The `timezone` parameter accepts a valid [time zone string](#time-zone-strings) that defines the time zone of the specified `session`. It does **not** change the meaning of returned UNIX timestamps, as they are *time zone-agnostic*. If the `timezone` argument is not specified, the function uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).
- The `bars_back` parameter accepts an "int" value specifying which bar's time the returned timestamp represents. If the value is positive, the function returns the timestamp from that number of bars back relative to the current bar. If the value is negative and greater than or equal to -500, the function returns the *expected* timestamp of a future bar. The default value is 0.

Similar to the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) and [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variables, these functions behave differently on *time-based* and *non-time-based* charts.

Time-based charts have bars that open and close at *predictable* times, whereas the bars on [tick charts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000709225/) and all [non-standard charts](#non-standard-charts-data), excluding [Heikin Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000619436/), open and close at irregular, *unpredictable* times. Consequently, [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) cannot calculate the expected closing times of realtime bars on non-time-based charts, so it returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) on those bars. Similarly, the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) function with a negative `bars_back` value cannot accurately calculate the expected opening time of a future realtime bar on these charts. See the *second example* in [this section](#time-and-time_close-variables) above. That example script exhibits the same behavior on a price-based chart if it uses a [time_close("")](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) call instead of the [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variable.

Typical use cases for the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions include:

- Testing for bars that open or close in [specific sessions](#testing-for-sessions) defined by the `session` and `timezone` parameters.
- [Testing for changes](#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) or measuring time differences on specified higher timeframes.

#### [Testing for sessions](https://www.tradingview.com#testing-for-sessions)

The [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions' `session` and `timezone` parameters define the [sessions](#sessions) for which they can return *non-na* values. If a call to either function references a bar that opens/closes within the defined session in a given [time zone](#time-zones), it returns a [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) for that bar. Otherwise, it returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na). Programmers can pass the returned values to the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) function to identify which bars open or close within specified intervals, which is helpful for session-based calculations and logic.

This simple script identifies when a bar on the chart's timeframe opens at or after 11:00 and before 13:00 in the exchange time zone on any trading day. It calls [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) with [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) as the `timeframe` argument and the `"1100-1300"`[session string](#session-strings) as the `session` argument, and then verifies whether the returned value is [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) with the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) function. When the value is **not**[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), the script highlights the chart's background to indicate that the bar opened in the session:

![image](images/Time-Time-functions-Time-and-time-close-Testing-for-sessions-1.CJeOvGxZ_Z1sBkKc.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Testing for session bars demo", overlay = true)

//@variable Checks if the bar opens between 11:00 and 13:00. Is `true` if the `time()` function does not return `na`. 
bool inSession = not na(time(timeframe.period, "1100-1300"))

// Highlight the background of the bars that are in the session "11:00-13:00". 
bgcolor(inSession ? color.rgb(155, 39, 176, 80) : na)
```

Note that:

- The `session` argument in the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call represents an interval in the *exchange* time zone because [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) is the default `timezone` argument.
- The session string expresses the start and end times in the `"HHmm-HHmm"` format, where `"HH"` is the two-digit *hour* and `"mm"` is the two-digit *minute*. Session strings can also specify the *weekdays* a session applies to. However, the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call's `session` argument (`"1100-1300"`) does not include this information, which is why it considers the session valid for *every* day. See the [Sessions](#sessions) page to learn more.

When using session strings in [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) calls, it's crucial to understand that such strings define start and end times in a *specific*[time zone](#time-zones). The local hour and minute in one region may not correspond to the same point in UNIX time as that same hour and minute in another region. Therefore, calls to these functions with different `timezone` arguments can return non-na timestamps at *different* times, as the specified [time zone string](#time-zone-strings) changes the meaning of the local times represented in the `session` argument.

This example demonstrates how the `timezone` parameter affects the `session` parameter in a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) function call. The script calculates an `opensInSession` condition that uses a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call with arguments based on [inputs](#inputs). The [session input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.session) for the `session` argument includes four preset options: `"0000-0400"`, `"0930-1400"`, `"1300-1700"`, and `"1700-2100"`. The [string input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.string) that defines the `timezone` argument includes four IANA time zone options representing different offsets from UTC: `"America/Vancouver"` (UTC-7/-8), `"America/New_York"` (UTC-4/-5), `"Asia/Dubai"` (UTC+4), and `"Austrailia/Sydney"` (UTC+10/+11).

For any chosen `sessionInput` value, changing the `timezoneInput` value changes the specified session's time zone. The script highlights *different bars* with each time zone choice because, unlike [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps), the *absolute* times that local hour and minute values correspond to *varies* across time zones:

![image](images/Time-Time-functions-Time-and-time-close-Testing-for-sessions-2.DKRpvO46_Z1pg5HR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Testing session time zones demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The timeframe of the analyzed bars. 
string timeframeInput = input.timeframe("60", "Timeframe")
//@variable The session to check. Features four interval options. 
string sessionInput = input.session("1300-1700", "Session", ["0000-0400", "0930-1400", "1300-1700", "1700-2100"])
//@variable An IANA identifier representing the time zone of the `sessionInput`. Fetures four preset options. 
string timezoneInput = input.string("America/New_York", "Time zone", 
     ["America/Vancouver", "America/New_York", "Asia/Dubai", "Australia/Sydney"]
 )

//@variable Is `true` if a `timeframeInput` bar opens within the `sessionInput` session in the `timezoneInput` time zone.
//          The condition detects the session on different bars, depending on the chosesn time zone, because identical 
//          local times in different time zones refer to different absolute points in UNIX time.  
bool opensInSession = not na(time(timeframeInput, sessionInput, timezoneInput))

// Highlight the background when `opensInSession` is `true`. 
bgcolor(opensInSession ? color.rgb(33, 149, 243, 80) : na, title = "Open in session highlight")
```

Note that:

- This script uses *IANA notation* for all [time zone strings](#time-zone-strings) because it is the recommended format. Using an IANA identifier allows the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) call to automatically adjust the session's UTC offset based on a region's local time policies, such as daylight saving time.

#### [Testing for changes in higher timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes)

The `timeframe` parameter of the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) and [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) functions specifies the timeframe of the bars in the calculation, allowing scripts to retrieve opening/closing [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) from *higher timeframes* than the current chart's timeframe without requiring `request.*()` function calls.

Programmers can use the opening/closing timestamps from higher-timeframe (HTF) bars to detect timeframe changes. One common approach is to call [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) or [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) with a consistent `timeframe` argument across all executions on a time-based chart and measure the one-bar change in the returned value with the [ta.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) function. The result is a *nonzero* value only when an HTF bar opens. One can also check whether the data has a time gap at that point by comparing the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) value to the previous bar's [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) value. A gap is present when the opening timestamp on the current bar is greater than the closing timestamp on the previous bar.

The script below calls [time("1M")](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) to get the opening UNIX timestamp of the current bar on the "1M" timeframe. It detects when bars on that timeframe open by checking when the [ta.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) of the timestamp returns a value greater than 0. On each occurrence of the condition, the script detects whether the HTF bar opened after a gap by checking if the opening time is greater than the previous bar's [time_close("1M")](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) value.

The script draws [labels](#labels) containing [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) "1M" opening times to indicate the chart bars that mark the start of monthly bars. If a monthly bar opens without a gap from the previous closing time, the script draws a blue label. If a monthly bar starts after a gap, it draws a red label. Additionally, if the "1M" opening time does not match the opening time of the chart bar, the script displays that bar's formatted time in the label for comparison:

    // Initialize variables for the `text` and `color` properties of the label drawing.
    string lblText  = "New '1M' opening time:\n" + str.format_time(currMonthlyOpenTime)
    color  lblColor = color.blue

    //@variable Is `true` when the `currMonthlyOpenTime` exceeds the `prevMonthlyCloseTime`, indicating a time gap.
    bool hasGap = currMonthlyOpenTime > prevMonthlyCloseTime

         time, high, lblText, xloc.bar_time, color = lblColor, style = label.style_label_lower_right, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.large
     )
```

Note that:

- Using [ta.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) on a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) or [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) call's result is not the *only* way to detect changes in a higher timeframe. The [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change) function is an equivalent, more convenient option for scripts that do not need to *use* the UNIX timestamps from HTF bars in other calculations, as it returns a "bool" value directly without extra code.
- The detected monthly opening times do not always correspond to the first calendar day of the month. Instead, they correspond to the first time assigned to a "1M" bar, which can be *after* the first calendar day. For symbols with overnight sessions, such as "USDJPY" in our example chart, a "1M" bar can also open *before* the first calendar day.
- Sometimes, the opening time assigned to an HTF bar might *not* equal the opening time of any chart bar, which is why other conditions such as `time == time("1M")` cannot detect new monthly bars consistently. For example, on our "USDJPY" chart, the "1M" opening time `2023-12-31T17:00:00-0500` does not match an opening time on the "1D" timeframe. The first available "1D" bar after that point opened at `2024-01-01T17:00:00-0500`.

### [Calendar-based functions](https://www.tradingview.com#calendar-based-functions)

The [year()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_year), [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [weekofyear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_weekofyear), [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth), [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek), [hour()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hour), [minute()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_minute), and [second()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_second) functions calculate *calendar-based* "int" values from a [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps). Unlike the [calendar-based variables](#calendar-based-variables), which always hold exchange calendar values based on the current bar's opening timestamp, these functions can return calendar values for any valid timestamp and express them in a chosen [time zone](#time-zones).

Each of these calendar-based functions has the following two signatures:

```
functionName(time) → series intfunctionName(time, timezone) → series int
```

Where:

- `functionName` is the function's identifier.
- The `time` parameter accepts an "int" UNIX timestamp for which the function calculates a corresponding calendar value.
- The `timezone` parameter accepts a [time zone string](#time-zone-strings) specifying the returned value's time zone. If the `timezone` argument is not specified, the function uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).

In contrast to the functions that return UNIX timestamps, a calendar-based function returns different "int" results for various time zones, as calendar values represent parts of a *local time* in a *specific region*.

For instance, the simple script below uses two calls to [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) to calculate each bar's opening day in the exchange time zone and the "Australia/Sydney" time zone. It plots the results of the two calls in a separate pane for comparison:

![image](images/Time-Time-functions-Calendar-based-functions-1.7yz46qU5_56taF.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`dayofmonth()` demo", overlay = false)

//@variable An "int" representing the current bar's opening calendar day in the exchange time zone. 
//          Equivalent to the `dayofmonth` variable. 
int openingDay = dayofmonth(time)

//@variable An "int" representing the current bar's opening calendar day in the "Australia/Sydney" time zone.
int openingDaySydney = dayofmonth(time, "Australia/Sydney")

// Plot the calendar day values.
plot(openingDay,       "Day of Month (Exchange)", linewidth = 6, color = color.blue)
plot(openingDaySydney, "Day of Month (Sydney)",   linewidth = 3, color = color.orange)
```

Note that:

- The first [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) call calculates the bar's opening day in the exchange time zone because it does not include a `timezone` argument. This call returns the same value that the [dayofmonth](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_dayofmonth) variable references.
- Our example symbol's exchange time zone is "America/New_York", which follows UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time (DST). The "Australia/Sydney" time zone follows UTC+10 during standard time and UTC+11 during DST. However, Sydney observes DST at *different* times of the year than New York. As such, its time zone is 14, 15, or 16 hours ahead of the exchange time zone, depending on the time of year. The plots on our "1D" chart diverge when the difference is at least 15 hours because the bars open at 09:30 in exchange time, and 15 hours ahead is 00:30 on the *next* calendar day.

It's important to understand that although the `time` argument in a calendar-based function call represents a single, absolute point in time, each function returns only *part* of the date and time information available from the timestamp. Consequently, a calendar-based function's returned value does **not** directly correspond to a *unique* time point, and conditions based on individual calendar values can apply to *multiple* bars.

For example, this script uses the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function to calculate a UNIX timestamp from a date "string", and it calculates the calendar day from that timestamp, in the exchange time zone, with the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) function. The script compares each bar's opening day to the calculated day and highlights the background when the two are equal:

![image](images/Time-Time-functions-Calendar-based-functions-2.CLs3hZaQ_Z1mTUCj.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`dayofmonth()` demo", overlay = false)

//@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to August 29, 2024 at 00:00:00 UTC.
const int fixedTimestamp = timestamp("29 Aug 2024")
//@variable The day of the month calculated from the `fixedTimestamp`, expressed in the exchange time zone. 
//          If the exchange time zone has a negative UTC offset, this variable's value is 28 instead of 29.
int dayFromTimestamp = dayofmonth(fixedTimestamp)

//@variable An "int" representing the current bar's opening calendar day in the exchange time zone. 
//          Equivalent to the `dayofmonth` variable. 
int openingDay = dayofmonth(time)

// Plot the `openingDay`.
plot(openingDay, "Opening day of month", linewidth = 3)
// Highlight the background when the `openingDay` equals the `dayFromTimestamp`.
bgcolor(openingDay == dayFromTimestamp ? color.orange : na, title = "Day detected highlight")
```

Note that:

- The [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call treats its argument as a *UTC* calendar date because its `dateString` argument does not specify time zone information. However, the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) call calculates the day in the *exchange time zone*. Our example symbol's exchange time zone is "America/New_York" (UTC-4/-5). Therefore, the returned value on this chart is 28 instead of 29.
- The script highlights *any* bar on our chart that opens on the 28th day of *any* month instead of only a specific bar because the [dayofmonth()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofmonth) function's returned value does **not** represent a specific point in time on its own.
- This script highlights the bars that *open* on the day of the month calculated from the timestamp. However, some months on our chart have no trading activity on that day. For example, the script does not highlight when the July 28, 2024 occurs on our chart because NASDAQ is closed on Sundays.

Similar to [calendar-based variables](#calendar-based-variables), these functions are also helpful when testing for dates/times and detecting calendar changes on the chart. The example below uses the [year()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_year), [month()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_month), [weekofyear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_weekofyear), and [dayofweek()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_dayofweek) functions on the [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) timestamp to create conditions that test if the current bar is the first bar that closes in a new year, quarter, month, week, and day. The script uses [plotted shapes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape), [labels](#labels), and [background colors](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor) to visualize the conditions on the chart:

![image](images/Time-Time-functions-Calendar-based-functions-3.BgN06lg1_1QVzL3.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Calendar changes demo", overlay = true, max_labels_count = 500)

// Calculate the year, month, week of year, and day of week corresponding to the `time_close` UNIX timestamp.
// All values are expressed in the exchange time zone. 
int closeYear       = year(time_close)
int closeMonth      = month(time_close)
int closeWeekOfYear = weekofyear(time_close)
int closeDayOfWeek  = dayofweek(time_close)

//@variable Is `true` when the change in `closeYear` exceeds 0, marking the first bar that closes in a new year.  
bool closeInNewYear = ta.change(closeYear) > 0
//@variable Is `true` when the difference in `closeMonth` is not 0, marking the first bar that closes in a new month. 
bool closeInNewMonth = closeMonth - closeMonth[1] != 0
//@variable Is `true` when `closeMonth - 1` becomes divisible by 3, marking the first bar that closes in a new quarter. 
bool closeInNewQuarter = (closeMonth[1] - 1) % 3 != 0 and (closeMonth - 1) % 3 == 0
//@variable Is `true` when the change in `closeWeekOfYear` is not 0, marking the first bar that closes in a new week.
bool closeInNewWeek = ta.change(closeWeekOfYear) != 0
//@variable Is `true` when the `closeDayOfWeek` changes, marking the first bar that closes in the new day.
bool closeInNewDay = closeDayOfWeek != closeDayOfWeek[1]

//@variable Switches between `true` and `false` after every `closeInNewDay` occurrence for background color calculation.
var bool alternateDay = true
if closeInNewDay
    alternateDay := not alternateDay

// Draw a label above the bar to display the `closeWeekOfYear` when `closeInNewWeek` is `true`. 
if closeInNewWeek
    label.new(
         time, 0, "W" + str.tostring(closeWeekOfYear), xloc.bar_time, yloc.abovebar, color.purple, 
         textcolor = color.white, size = size.normal
     )
// Plot label shapes at the bottom and top of the chart for the `closeInNewYear` and `closeInNewMonth` conditions. 
plotshape(
     closeInNewYear, "Close in new year", shape.labelup, location.bottom, color.teal, text = "New year", 
     textcolor = color.white, size = size.huge
 )
plotshape(
     closeInNewMonth, "Close in new month", shape.labeldown, location.top, text = "New month", 
     textcolor = color.white, size = size.large
 )
// Plot a triangle below the chart bar when `closeInNewQuarter` occurs. 
plotshape(
     closeInNewQuarter, "Close in new quarter", shape.triangleup, location.belowbar, color.maroon, 
     text = "New quarter", textcolor = color.maroon, size = size.large
 )
// Highlight the background in alternating colors based on occurrences of `closeInNewDay`.
bgcolor(alternateDay ? color.new(color.aqua, 80) : color.new(color.fuchsia, 80), title = "Closing day change")
```

Note that:

- This script's conditions check for the first bar that closes after each calendar unit changes its value. The bar where each condition is `true` varies with the data available on the chart. For example, the `closeInNewMonth` condition can be `true`*after* the first calendar day of the month if a chart bar did not close on that day.
- To detect when new bars start on a specific *timeframe* rather than strictly calendar changes, check when the [ta.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) of a [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) or [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close) call's returned value is nonzero, or use the [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change) function. See [this section](#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) above for more information.

### [`timestamp()`](https://www.tradingview.com#timestamp)

The [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function calculates a [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) from a specified calendar date and time. It has the following three signatures:

```
timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → simple/series inttimestamp(timezone, year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → simple/series inttimestamp(dateString) → const int
```

The first two signatures listed include `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second` parameters that accept "int" values defining the calendar date and time. A [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call with either signature must include `year`, `month`, and `day` arguments. The other parameters are optional, each with a default value of 0. Both signatures can return either *"simple"* or *"series"* values, depending on the [qualified types](#qualifiers) of the specified arguments.

The primary difference between the first two signatures is the `timezone` parameter, which accepts a [time zone string](#time-zone-strings) that determines the [time zone](#time-zones) of the *date and time* specified by the other parameters. If a [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call with "int" calendar arguments does not include a `timezone` argument, it uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)) by default.

The third signature listed has only *one* parameter, `dateString`, which accepts a "string" representing a valid calendar date (e.g., `"20 Aug 2024"`). The value can also include the time of day and time zone (e.g., `"20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 UTC+0"`). If the `dateString` argument does not specify the time of day, the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call considers the time 00:00 (midnight).

Unlike the other two signatures, the default time zone for the third signature is **GMT+0**. It does **not** use the exchange time zone by default because it interprets time zone information from the `dateString` directly. Additionally, the third signature is the only one that returns a *"const int"* value. As shown in the [Time input](#time-input) section of the [Inputs](#inputs) page, programmers can use this overload's returned value as the `defval` argument in an [input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time) function call.

When using the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) function, it's crucial to understand how time zone information affects its calculations. The *absolute* point in time represented by a specific calendar date *depends* on its time zone, as an identical date and time in various time zones can refer to **different** amounts of time elapsed since the *UNIX Epoch*. Therefore, changing the time zone of the calendar date and time in a [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call *can change* its returned [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps).

The following script compares the results of four different [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) calls that evaluate the date 2021-01-01 in different time zones. The first [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call does not specify time zone information in its `dateString` argument, so it treats the value as a *UTC* calendar date. The fourth call also evaluates the calendar date in UTC because it includes `"UTC0"` as the `timezone` argument. The second [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call uses the first signature listed above, meaning it uses the exchange time zone, and the third call uses the second signature with `"America/New_York"` as the `timezone` argument.

The script draws a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) with rows displaying each [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) call, its assigned variable, the calculated UNIX timestamp, and a [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) representation of the time. As we see on the "NASDAQ:MSFT" chart below, the first and fourth table rows show *different* timestamps than the second and third, leading to different formatted strings in the last column:

![image](images/Time-Time-functions-Timestamp-1.CFLoCdL8_A5DD7.png)

```

     position.middle_center, 4, 5, color.white, border_color = color.black, border_width = 2
 )

//@function Initializes a `displayTable` cell showing the `displayText` with an optional `specialFormat`.
printCell(int colID, int rowID, string displayText, string specialFormat = "") => 
    displayTable.cell(colID, rowID, displayText, text_size = size.large)
    switch specialFormat 
        "header"  => displayTable.cell_set_bgcolor(colID, rowID, color.rgb(76, 175, 79, 70))
        "code"    => 
            displayTable.cell_set_text_font_family(colID, rowID, font.family_monospace)
            displayTable.cell_set_text_size(colID, rowID, size.normal)
            displayTable.cell_set_text_halign(colID, rowID, text.align_left)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to January 1, 2021 in the UTC+0 time zone. 
    int dateTimestamp1 = timestamp("2021-01-01")
    //@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to January 1, 2021 in the exchange time zone. 
    int dateTimestamp2 = timestamp(2021, 1, 1, 0, 0)
    //@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to January 1, 2021 in the "America/New_York" time zone. 
    int dateTimestamp3 = timestamp("America/New_York", 2021, 1, 1, 0, 0)
    //@variable The UNIX timestamp corresponding to January 1, 2021 in the "UTC0" (UTC+0) time zone. 
    int dateTimestamp4 = timestamp("UTC0", 2021, 1, 1, 0, 0)

    // Initialize the top header cells in the `displayTable`. 
    printCell(0, 0, "Variable",            "header")
    printCell(1, 0, "Function call",       "header")
    printCell(2, 0, "Timestamp returned",  "header")
    printCell(3, 0, "Formatted date/time", "header")
    // Initialize a table row for `dateTimestamp1` results. 
    printCell(0, 1, "`dateTimestamp1`", "header")
    printCell(1, 1, "`timestamp(\"2021-01-01\")`", "code")
    printCell(2, 1, str.tostring(dateTimestamp1))
    printCell(3, 1, str.format_time(dateTimestamp1, "yyyy.MM.dd  HH:mm (Z)"))
    // Initialize a table row for `dateTimestamp2` results. 
    printCell(0, 2, "`dateTimestamp2`", "header")
    printCell(1, 2, "`timestamp(2021, 1, 1, 0, 0)`", "code")
    printCell(2, 2, str.tostring(dateTimestamp2))
    printCell(3, 2, str.format_time(dateTimestamp2, "yyyy.MM.dd  HH:mm (Z)"))
    // Initialize a table row for `dateTimestamp3` results. 
    printCell(0, 3, "`dateTimestamp3`", "header")
    printCell(1, 3, "`timestamp(\"America/New_York\", 2021, 1, 1, 0, 0)`", "code")
    printCell(2, 3, str.tostring(dateTimestamp3))
    printCell(3, 3, str.format_time(dateTimestamp3, "yyyy.MM.dd  HH:mm (Z)"))
    // Initialize a table row for `dateTimestamp4` results. 
    printCell(0, 4, "`dateTimestamp4`", "header")
    printCell(1, 4, "`timestamp(\"UTC0\", 2021, 1, 1, 0, 0)`", "code")
    printCell(2, 4, str.tostring(dateTimestamp4))
    printCell(3, 4, str.format_time(dateTimestamp4, "yyyy.MM.dd  HH:mm (Z)"))
```

Note that:

- The [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) date-time strings express results in the exchange time zone because the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function uses [syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone) as the default `timezone` argument. The formatted values on our example chart show the offset string `"-0500"` because NASDAQ's time zone ("America/New_York") follows UTC-5 during *standard time*.
- The formatted strings on the first and fourth rows show the date and time five hours *before* January 1, 2021, because the [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) calls evaluated the date in *UTC* and the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) calls used a time zone five hours *behind* UTC.
- On our chart, the second and third rows have matching timestamps because both corresponding [timestamp()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timestamp) calls evaluated the date in the "America/New_York" time zone. The two rows would show different results if we applied the script to a symbol with a different exchange time zone.

## [Formatting dates and times](https://www.tradingview.com#formatting-dates-and-times)

Programmers can format [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps) into human-readable dates and times, expressed in specific [time zones](#time-zones), using the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function. The function has the following signature:

```
str.format_time(time, format, timezone) → series string
```

Where:

- The `time` parameter specifies the "int" UNIX timestamp to express as a readable time.
- The `format` parameter accepts a "string" consisting of *formatting tokens* that determine the returned information. If the function call does not include a `format` argument, it uses the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard format: `"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ"`. See the table below for a list of valid tokens and the information they represent.
- The `timezone` parameter determines the time zone of the formatted result. It accepts a [time zone string](#time-zone-strings) in UTC or IANA notation. If the call does not specify a `timezone`, it uses the exchange time zone ([syminfo.timezone](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.timezone)).

The general-purpose [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format) function can also format UNIX timestamps into readable dates and times. However, the function **cannot** express time information in *different* time zones. It always expresses dates and times in **UTC+0**. In turn, using this function to format timestamps often results in *erroneous* practices, such as mathematically modifying a timestamp to try and represent the time in another time zone. However, a UNIX timestamp is a unique, **time zone-agnostic** representation of a specific point in time. As such, modifying a UNIX timestamp changes the *absolute time* it represents rather than expressing the same time in a different time zone.

The [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function does not have this limitation, as it can calculate dates and times in *any* time zone correctly without changing the meaning of a UNIX timestamp. In addition, unlike [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format), it is optimized specifically for processing time values. Therefore, we recommend that programmers use [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) instead of [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format) to format UNIX timestamps into readable dates and times.

A [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) call's `format` argument determines the time information its returned value contains. The function treats characters and sequences in the argument as *formatting tokens*, which act as *placeholders* for values in the returned date/time "string". The following table outlines the most commonly used formatting tokens and explains what each represents:

## [Expressing time differences](https://www.tradingview.com#expressing-time-differences)

Every [UNIX timestamp](#unix-timestamps) represents a specific point in time as the absolute *time difference* from a fixed historical point (epoch). The specific epoch all UNIX timestamps reference is *midnight UTC on January 1, 1970*. Programmers can [format](#formatting-dates-and-times) UNIX timestamps into readable date-time strings with the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function because it uses the time difference from the UNIX Epoch in its date and time calculations.

In contrast, the difference between two nonzero UNIX timestamps represents the number of milliseconds elapsed from one absolute point to another. The difference does not directly refer to a specific point in UNIX time if neither timestamp in the operation has a value of 0 (corresponding to the UNIX Epoch).

Programmers may want to express the millisecond difference between two UNIX timestamps in *other time units*, such as seconds, days, etc. Some might assume they can use the difference as the `time` argument in a [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) call to achieve this result. However, the function always treats its `time` argument as the time elapsed from the *UNIX Epoch* to derive a *calendar date/time* representation in a specific [time zone](#time-zones). It **does not** express time differences directly. Therefore, attempting to format timestamp *differences* rather than timestamps with [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) leads to unintended results.

For example, the following script calculates the millisecond difference between the current execution time ([timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow)) and the "1M" bar's closing time ([time_close("1M")](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close)) for a monthly countdown timer display. It attempts to express the time difference in another format using [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time). It displays the function call's result in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table), along with the original millisecond difference (`timeLeft`) and [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) date-time representations of the timestamps.

As we see below, the table shows correct results for the formatted timestamps and the `timeLeft` value. However, the formatted time difference appears as `"1970-01-12T16:47:10-0500"`. Although the `timeLeft` value is supposed to represent a difference between timestamps rather than a specific point in time, the [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time) function still treats the value as a **UNIX timestamp**. Consequently, it creates a "string" expressing the value as a *date and time* in the UTC-5 time zone:

![image](images/Time-Relative-time-differences-1.Bn5sSvwp_ZWpy0r.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Incorrectly formatting time difference demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A table that displays monthly close countdown information.
var table displayTable = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 4, color.rgb(0, 188, 212, 60))

if barstate.islast
    //@variable A UNIX timestamp representing the current time as of the script's latest execution. 
    int currentTime = timenow
    //@variable A UNIX timestamp representing the expected closing time of the current "1M" bar. 
    int monthCloseTime = time_close("1M")

    //@variable The number of milliseconds between the `currentTime` and the `monthCloseTime`. 
    //          This value is NOT intended as a UNIX timestamp.
    int timeLeft = monthCloseTime - currentTime
    //@variable A "string" representing the `timeLeft` as a date and time in the exchange time zone, in ISO 8601 format.
    //          This format is INCORRECT for the `timeLeft` value because it's supposed to represent the time between 
    //          two nonzero UNIX timestamps, NOT a specific point in time.
    string incorrectTimeFormat = str.format_time(timeLeft)

    // Initialize `displayTable` cells to initialize the `currentTime` and `monthCloseTime`.
    displayTable.cell(
         0, 0, "Current time: " + str.format_time(currentTime, "HH:mm:ss.S dd/MM/yy (z)"), 
         text_size = size.large, text_halign = text.align_right
     )
    displayTable.cell(
         0, 1, "`1M` Bar closing time: " + str.format_time(monthCloseTime, "HH:mm:ss.SS dd/MM/yy (z)"), 
         text_size = size.large, text_halign = text.align_right
     )
    // Initialize a cell to display the `timeLeft` millisecond difference.
    displayTable.cell(
         0, 2, "`timeLeft` value: " + str.tostring(timeLeft), 
         text_size = size.large, bgcolor = color.yellow
     )
    // Initialize a cell to display the `incorrectTimeFormat` representation.
    displayTable.cell(
         0, 3, "Time left (incorrect format): " + incorrectTimeFormat, 
         text_size = size.large, bgcolor = color.maroon, text_color = color.white
     )
```

To express the difference between timestamps in other time units correctly, programmers must write code that *calculates* the number of units elapsed instead of erroneously formatting the difference as a specific date or time.

The calculations required to express time differences depend on the chosen time units. The sections below explain how to express millisecond differences in [weekly and smaller units](#weekly-and-smaller-units), and [monthly and larger units](#monthly-and-larger-units).

### [Weekly and smaller units](https://www.tradingview.com#weekly-and-smaller-units)

Weeks and smaller time units (days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) cover *consistent* blocks of time. These units have the following relationship:

- One week equals seven days.
- One day equals 24 hours.
- One hour equals 60 minutes.
- One minute equals 60 seconds.
- One second equals 1000 milliseconds.

Using this relationship, programmers can define the span of these units by the number of *milliseconds* they contain. For example, since every hour has 60 minutes, every minute has 60 seconds, and every second has 1000 milliseconds, the number of milliseconds per hour is `60 * 60 * 1000`, which equals `3600000`.

Programmers can use *modular arithmetic* based on the milliseconds in each unit to calculate the total number of weeks, days, and smaller spans covered by the difference between two [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps). The process is as follows, starting from the *largest* time unit in the calculation:

1. Calculate the number of milliseconds in the time unit.
2. Divide the remaining millisecond difference by the calculated value and round down to the nearest whole number. The result represents the number of *complete* time units within the interval.
3. Use the *remainder* from the division as the new remaining millisecond difference.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each time unit in the calculation, in *descending* order based on size.

The following script implements this process in a custom `formatTimeSpan()` function. The function accepts two UNIX timestamps defining a start and end point, and its "bool" parameters control whether it calculates the number of weeks or smaller units covered by the time range. The function calculates the millisecond distance between the two timestamps. It then calculates the numbers of complete units covered by that distance and formats the results into a "string".

The script calls `formatTimeSpan()` to express the difference between two separate [time input](#time-input) values in selected time units. It then displays the resulting "string" in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) alongside [formatted](#formatting-dates-and-times) representations of the start and end times:

```

Note that:

- The [user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) uses [math.floor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.floor) to round each divided result down to the nearest "int" value to get the number of *complete* units in the interval. After division, it uses the modulo assignment operator ([%=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%25=)) to get the *remainder* and assign that value to the `timeDifference` variable. This process repeats for each selected unit.

The image above shows the calculated time difference in mixed time units. By toggling the "bool" inputs, users can also isolate specific units in the calculation. For example, this image shows the result after enabling only the "Milliseconds" input:

![image](images/Time-Relative-time-differences-Weekly-and-smaller-units-2.CwvuIXRj_ZdIqWW.png)

### [Monthly and larger units](https://www.tradingview.com#monthly-and-larger-units)

Unlike weeks and smaller units, months and larger units *vary* in length based on calendar rules. For example, a month can contain 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, and a year can contain 365 or 366 days.

Some programmers prefer to use the modular arithmetic outlined in the [previous section](#weekly-and-smaller-units), with *approximate lengths* for these irregular units, to calculate large-unit durations between [UNIX timestamps](#unix-timestamps). With this process, programmers usually define the units in either of the following ways:

- Using *common* lengths, e.g., a common year equals 365 days, and a common month equals 30 days.
- Using the *average* lengths, e.g., an average year equals 365.25 days, and an average month equals 30.4375 days.

Calculations involving approximate units produce *rough estimates* of the elapsed time. Such estimates are often practical when expressing relatively short durations. However, their precision diminishes with the size of the difference, drifting further away from the actual time elapsed.

Therefore, expressing time differences in monthly and larger units with precision requires a different calculation than the process outlined above. For a more precise estimate of months, years, and larger units elapsed, the calculations should use the *actual* span of each individual unit rather than approximations, meaning it must account for *leap years* and *variations* in month sizes.

The advanced example below contains a custom `formatTimeDifference()` function that calculates the years and months, in addition to days and smaller units, elapsed between two UNIX timestamps.

The function uses the process outlined in the [previous section](#weekly-and-smaller-units) to calculate the daily and smaller units within the interval. For the monthly and yearly units, which have *irregular* lengths, the function uses a [while](#while-loops) loop to iterate across calendar months. On each iteration, it increments monthly and yearly counters and subtracts the number of days in the added month from the day counter. After the loop ends, the function adjusts the year, month, and day counters to account for partial months elapsed between the timestamps. Finally, it uses the counters in a [str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format) call to create a formatted "string" containing the calculated values.

The script calls this `formatTimeDifference()` function to calculate the years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds elapsed between two separate [time input](#time-input) values and displays the result in a [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label):

    // Subtract `remainingInMonth` from the `days`, and offset the `startDay` and `startMonth`.
    days -= remainingInMonth, startDay := 1, startMonth += 1
    // Set `startMonth` to 1, and increase the `startYear` if the `startMonth` exceeds 12.
    if startMonth > 12
        startMonth := 1, startYear += 1
    // Initialize variables to count the total number of months and years in the interval.
    int months = 0, int years  = 0
    // Loop to increment `months` and `years` values based on the `days`.
    while days > 0
        //@variable The number of days in the current `startMonth`.
        int daysInMonth = daysPerMonth(startYear, startMonth)
        // Break the loop if the number of remaining days is less than the `daysInMonth`.
        if days < daysInMonth
            break
        // Reduce the `days` by the `daysInMonth` and increment the `months`.
        days -= daysInMonth, months += 1
        // Increase the `years` and reset the `months` to 0 when `months` is 12.
        if months == 12
            months := 0, years += 1
        // Increase the `startMonth` and adjust the `startMonth` and `startYear` if its value exceeds 12.
        startMonth += 1
        if startMonth > 12
            startMonth := 1, startYear += 1
    // Re-add the `remainingInMonth` value to the number of `days`. Adjust the `days`, `months`, and `years` if the 
    // new value exceeds the `daysInStartMonth` or `daysInEndMonth`, depending on the `startDay`.
    days += remainingInMonth
    if days >= (startDay < daysInStartMonth / 2 ? daysInStartMonth : daysInEndMonth) 
        months += 1
        if months == 12
            months := 0, years += 1
        days -= remainingInMonth
    // Format the calculated values into a "string" and return the result.
    str.format(
         " Years:   {0}\n Months: {1}\n Days:    {2}\n Hours:    {3}\n Minutes:  {4}\n Seconds: {5}
         \n Milliseconds: {6}", years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
     )

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A "string" representing the time between the `startTimeInput` and `endTimeInput` in mixed units. 
    string userTimeSpan = formatTimeDifference(startTimeInput, endTimeInput)
    //@variable Text shown in the label.
    string labelText = "Start time: " + str.format_time(startTimeInput, "dd/MM/yy HH:mm:ss (z)") + "\n  End time: "
         +  str.format_time(endTimeInput, "dd/MM/yy HH:mm:ss (z)") + "\n---------\nTime difference:\n" + userTimeSpan
    label.new(
         bar_index, high, labelText, color = #FF946E, size = size.large, 
         textalign = text.align_left, style = label.style_label_center
     )
```

Note that:

- The script determines the number of days in each month with the user-defined `daysPerMonth()` function. The function identifies whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days based on its month number and the year it belongs to. Its calculation accounts for leap years. A leap year occurs when the year is divisible by 4 or 400 but not by 100.
- Before the [while](#while-loops) loop, the function subtracts the number of days in a partial starting month from the initial day count, aligning the counters with the beginning of a new month. It re-adds the subtracted days after the loop to adjust the counters for partial months. It adjusts the month and year counters based on the days in the `startMonth` if the `startDay` is less than halfway through that month. Otherwise, it adjusts the values based on the days in the `endMonth`.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Concepts](#alerts)/Timeframes

# [Timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#timeframes)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

The *timeframe* of a chart is sometimes also referred to as its
*interval* or *resolution*. It is the unit of time represented by one
bar on the chart. All standard chart types use a timeframe: "Bars",
"Candles", "Hollow Candles", "Line", "Area" and "Baseline".
One non-standard chart type also uses timeframes: "Heikin Ashi".

Programmers interested in accessing data from multiple timeframes will
need to become familiar with how timeframes are expressed in Pine
Script™, and how to use them.

**Timeframe strings** come into play in different contexts:

- They must be used in
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
  when requesting data from another symbol and/or timeframe. See the
  page on
  [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) to explore the use of
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity).
- They can be used as an argument to
  [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time)
  and
  [time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time_close)
  functions, to return the time of a higher timeframe bar. This, in
  turn, can be used to detect changes in higher timeframes from the
  chart's timeframe without using
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity).
  See the
  [Testing for changes in higher timeframes](#testing-for-changes-in-higher-timeframes) section to see how to do this.
- The
  [input.timeframe()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsession)
  function provides a way to allow script users to define a timeframe
  through a script's "Inputs" tab (see the
  [Timeframe input](#timeframe-input) section for more information).
- The
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  declaration statement has an optional `timeframe` parameter that can
  be used to provide multi-timeframe capabilities to simple scripts
  without using
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity).
- Many built-in variables provide information on the timeframe used by
  the chart the script is running on. See the
  [Chart timeframe](#chart-timeframe) section for more information on them, including
  [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dperiod)
  which returns a string in Pine Script™'s timeframe specification
  format.

## [Timeframe string specifications](https://www.tradingview.com#timeframe-string-specifications)

Timeframe strings follow these rules:

- They are composed of the multiplier and the timeframe unit, e.g.,
  "1S", "30" (30 minutes), "1D" (one day), "3M" (three
  months).
- The unit is represented by a single letter, with no letter used for
  minutes: "T" for ticks, "S" for seconds, "D" for days, "W" for weeks, and
  "M" for months.
- When no multiplier is used, 1 is assumed: "S" is equivalent to
  "1S", "D" to "1D", etc. If only "1" is used, it is interpreted
  as 1 minute, since no unit letter identifier is used for minutes.
- There is no "hour" unit; "1H" is **not** valid. The correct
  format for one hour is "60" (remember no unit letter is specified
  for minutes).
- The valid multipliers vary for each timeframe unit:

    - For ticks, only the discrete 1, 10, 100, and 1000 multipliers are valid.
    - For seconds, only the discrete 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 multipliers are valid.
    - For minutes, 1 to 1440.
    - For days, 1 to 365.
    - For weeks, 1 to 52.
    - For months, 1 to 12.

## [Comparing timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#comparing-timeframes)

It can be useful to compare different timeframe strings to determine,
for example, if the timeframe used on the chart is lower than the higher
timeframes used in the script.

Converting timeframe strings to a representation in fractional minutes
provides a way to compare them using a universal unit. This script uses
the
[timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe%7Bdot%7Din_seconds)
function to convert a timeframe into float seconds and then converts the
result into minutes:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Timeframe in minutes example", "", true)
string tfInput = input.timeframe(defval = "", title = "Input TF")

float chartTFInMinutes = timeframe.in_seconds() / 60
float inputTFInMinutes = timeframe.in_seconds(tfInput) / 60

var table t = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
string txt = "Chart TF: "    + str.tostring(chartTFInMinutes, "#.##### minutes") + 
  "\nInput TF: " + str.tostring(inputTFInMinutes, "#.##### minutes")
if barstate.isfirst
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
else if barstate.islast
    table.cell_set_text(t, 0, 0, txt)

if chartTFInMinutes > inputTFInMinutes
    runtime.error("The chart's timeframe must not be higher than the input's timeframe.")
```

Note that:

- We use the built-in
  [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe%7Bdot%7Din_seconds)
  function to convert the chart and the
  [input.timeframe()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsession)
  function into seconds, then divide by 60 to convert into minutes.
- We use two calls to the
  [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe%7Bdot%7Din_seconds)
  function in the initialization of the `chartTFInMinutes` and
  `inputTFInMinutes` variables. In the first instance, we do not
  supply an argument for its `timeframe` parameter, so the function
  returns the chart's timeframe in seconds. In the second call, we
  supply the timeframe selected by the script's user through the call
  to
  [input.timeframe()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsession).
- Next, we validate the timeframes to ensure that the input timeframe
  is equal to or higher than the chart's timeframe. If it is not, we
  generate a runtime error.
- We finally print the two timeframe values converted to minutes.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Writing scripts](#style-guide)/Style guide

# [Style guide](https://www.tradingview.com#style-guide)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

This style guide provides recommendations on how to name variables and
organize your Pine scripts in a standard way that works well. Scripts
that follow our best practices will be easier to read, understand and
maintain.

You can see scripts using these guidelines published from the
[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/u/TradingView/#published-scripts)
and
[PineCoders](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/#published-scripts)
accounts on the platform.

## [Naming Conventions](https://www.tradingview.com#naming-conventions)

We recommend the use of:

- `camelCase` for all identifiers, i.e., variable or function names:
  `ma`, `maFast`, `maLengthInput`, `maColor`, `roundedOHLC()`,
  `pivotHi()`.
- All caps `SNAKE_CASE` for constants: `BULL_COLOR`, `BEAR_COLOR`,
  `MAX_LOOKBACK`.
- The use of qualifying suffixes when it provides valuable clues about
  the type or provenance of a variable: `maShowInput`, `bearColor`,
  `bearColorInput`, `volumesArray`, `maPlotID`, `resultsTable`,
  `levelsColorArray`.

## [Script organization](https://www.tradingview.com#script-organization)

The Pine Script™ compiler is quite forgiving of the positioning of
specific statements or the version
[compiler annotation](#compiler-annotations) in the script. While other arrangements are syntactically
correct, this is how we recommend organizing scripts:

```
<license><version><declaration_statement><import_statements><constant_declarations><inputs><function_declarations><calculations><strategy_calls><visuals><alerts>
```

### [<license>](https://www.tradingview.com#license)

If you publish your open-source scripts publicly on TradingView (scripts
can also be published privately), your open-source code is by default
protected by the Mozilla license. You may choose any other license you
prefer.

The reuse of code from those scripts is governed by our [House Rules on
Script
Publishing](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599)
which preempt the author's license.

The standard license comments appearing at the beginning of scripts are:

```
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
// © username
```

### [<version>](https://www.tradingview.com#version)

This is the
[compiler annotation](#compiler-annotations) defining the version of Pine Script™ the script will use. If
none is present, v1 is used. For v6, use:

```
//@version=6
```

### [<declaration_statement>](https://www.tradingview.com#declaration_statement)

This is the mandatory declaration statement which defines the type of
your script. It must be a call to either
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator),
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy),
or
[library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library).

### [<import_statements>](https://www.tradingview.com#import_statements)

If your script uses one or more Pine Script™
[libraries](#libraries), your
[import](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_import)
statements belong here.

### [<constant_declarations>](https://www.tradingview.com#constant_declarations)

Scripts can declare variables qualified as "const", i.e., ones
referencing a constant value.

We refer to variables as "constants" when they meet these criteria:

- Their declaration uses the optional `const` keyword (see our User
  Manual's section on
  [type qualifiers](#qualifiers) for more information).
- They are initialized using a literal (e.g., `100` or `"AAPL"`) or a
  built-in qualified as "const" (e.g., `color.green`).
- Their value does not change during the script's execution.

We use `SNAKE_CASE` to name these variables and group their declaration
near the top of the script. For example:

```
// ————— Constants
int     MS_IN_MIN   = 60 * 1000
int     MS_IN_HOUR  = MS_IN_MIN  * 60
int     MS_IN_DAY   = MS_IN_HOUR * 24

color   GRAY        = #808080ff
color   LIME        = #00FF00ff
color   MAROON      = #800000ff
color   ORANGE      = #FF8000ff
color   PINK        = #FF0080ff
color   TEAL        = #008080ff
color   BG_DIV      = color.new(ORANGE, 90)
color   BG_RESETS   = color.new(GRAY, 90)

string  RST1        = "No reset; cumulate since the beginning of the chart"
string  RST2        = "On a stepped higher timeframe (HTF)"
string  RST3        = "On a fixed HTF"
string  RST4        = "At a fixed time"
string  RST5        = "At the beginning of the regular session"
string  RST6        = "At the first visible chart bar"
string  RST7        = "Fixed rolling period"

string  LTF1        = "Least precise, covering many chart bars"
string  LTF2        = "Less precise, covering some chart bars"
string  LTF3        = "More precise, covering less chart bars"
string  LTF4        = "Most precise, 1min intrabars"

string  TT_TOTVOL     = "The 'Bodies' value is the transparency of the total volume candle bodies. Zero is opaque, 100 is transparent."
string  TT_RST_HTF    = "This value is used when '" + RST3 +"' is selected."
string  TT_RST_TIME   = "These values are used when '" + RST4 +"' is selected.
  A reset will occur when the time is greater or equal to the bar's open time, and less than its close time.\nHour: 0-23\nMinute: 0-59"
string  TT_RST_PERIOD = "This value is used when '" + RST7 +"' is selected."
```

In this example:

- The `RST*` and `LTF*` constants will be used as tuple elements in
  the `options` argument of `input.*()` calls.
- The `TT_*` constants will be used as `tooltip` arguments in
  `input.*()` calls. Note how we use a line continuation for long
  string literals.
- We do not use
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  to initialize constants. The Pine Script™ runtime is optimized to
  handle declarations on each bar, but using
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  to initialize a variable only the first time it is declared incurs a
  minor penalty on script performance because of the maintenance that
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  variables require on further bars.

Note that:

- Literals used in more than one place in a script should always be
  declared as a constant. Using the constant rather than the literal
  makes it more readable if it is given a meaningful name, and the
  practice makes code easier to maintain. Even though the quantity of
  milliseconds in a day is unlikely to change in the future,
  `MS_IN_DAY` is more meaningful than `1000 * 60 * 60 * 24`.
- Constants only used in the local block of a function or
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if),
  [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while),
  etc., statement for example, can be declared in that local block.

### [<inputs>](https://www.tradingview.com#inputs)

It is **much** easier to read scripts when all their inputs are in the
same code section. Placing that section at the beginning of the script
also reflects how they are processed at runtime, i.e., before the rest
of the script is executed.

Suffixing input variable names with `input` makes them more readily
identifiable when they are used later in the script: `maLengthInput`,
`bearColorInput`, `showAvgInput`, etc.

```
// ————— Inputs
string  resetInput              = input.string(RST2,        "CVD Resets",                       inline = "00", options = [RST1, RST2, RST3, RST4, RST5, RST6, RST7])
string  fixedTfInput            = input.timeframe("D",      "  Fixed HTF:  ",                   tooltip = TT_RST_HTF)
int     hourInput               = input.int(9,              "  Fixed time hour:  ",             inline = "01", minval = 0, maxval = 23)
int     minuteInput             = input.int(30,             "minute",                           inline = "01", minval = 0, maxval = 59, tooltip = TT_RST_TIME)
int     fixedPeriodInput        = input.int(20,             "  Fixed period:  ",                inline = "02", minval = 1, tooltip = TT_RST_PERIOD)
string  ltfModeInput            = input.string(LTF3,        "Intrabar precision",               inline = "03", options = [LTF1, LTF2, LTF3, LTF4])
```

### [<function_declarations>](https://www.tradingview.com#function_declarations)

All user-defined functions must be defined in the script's global
scope; nested function definitions are not allowed in Pine Script™.

Optimal function design should minimize the use of global variables in
the function's scope, as they undermine function portability. When it
can't be avoided, those functions must follow the global variable
declarations in the code, which entails they can't always be placed in
the <function_declarations> section. Such dependencies on global
variables should ideally be documented in the function's comments.

It will also help readers if you document the function's objective,
parameters and result. The same syntax used in
[libraries](#libraries) can be used to
document your functions. This can make it easier to port your functions
to a library should you ever decide to do so:

```
//@version=6
indicator("<function_declarations>", "", true)

string SIZE_LARGE  = "Large"
string SIZE_NORMAL = "Normal"
string SIZE_SMALL  = "Small"

string sizeInput = input.string(SIZE_NORMAL, "Size", options = [SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL])

// @function        Used to produce an argument for the `size` parameter in built-in functions.
// @param userSize  (simple string) User-selected size.
// @returns         One of the `size.*` built-in constants.
// Dependencies     SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL
getSize(simple string userSize) =>
    result = 
      switch userSize
        SIZE_LARGE  => size.large
        SIZE_NORMAL => size.normal
        SIZE_SMALL  => size.small
        => size.auto

if ta.rising(close, 3)
    label.new(bar_index, na, yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_arrowup, size = getSize(sizeInput))
```

### [<calculations>](https://www.tradingview.com#calculations)

This is where the script's core calculations and logic should be
placed. Code can be easier to read when variable declarations are placed
near the code segment using the variables. Some programmers prefer to
place all their non-constant variable declarations at the beginning of
this section, which is not always possible for all variables, as some
may require some calculations to have been executed before their
declaration.

### [<strategy_calls>](https://www.tradingview.com#strategy_calls)

Strategies are easier to read when strategy calls are grouped in the
same section of the script.

### [<visuals>](https://www.tradingview.com#visuals)

This section should ideally include all the statements producing the
script's visuals, whether they be plots, drawings, background colors,
candle-plotting, etc. See the Pine Script™ user manual's section on
[here](#z-index) for more
information on how the relative depth of visuals is determined.

### [<alerts>](https://www.tradingview.com#alerts)

Alert code will usually require the script's calculations to have
executed before it, so it makes sense to put it at the end of the
script.

## [Spacing](https://www.tradingview.com#spacing)

A space should be used on both sides of all operators, except unary
operators (`-1`). A space is also recommended after all commas and when
using named function arguments, as in `plot(series = close)`:

```
int a = close > open ? 1 : -1
var int newLen = 2
newLen := min(20, newlen + 1)
float a = -b
float c = d > e ? d - e : d
int index = bar_index % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2
plot(close, color = color.red)
```

## [Line wrapping](https://www.tradingview.com#line-wrapping)

Line wrapping can make long lines easier to read. Line wraps are defined
by using an indentation level that is not a multiple of four, as four
spaces or a tab are used to define local blocks. Here we use two spaces:

```
plot(
   series = close,
   title = "Close",
   color = color.blue,
   show_last = 10
 )
```

## [Vertical alignment](https://www.tradingview.com#vertical-alignment)

Vertical alignment using tabs or spaces can be useful in code sections
containing many similar lines such as constant declarations or inputs.
They can make mass edits much easier using the Pine Editor's
multi-cursor feature (`ctrl` +
`alt` + `🠅`):

```
// Colors used as defaults in inputs.
color COLOR_AQUA  = #0080FFff
color COLOR_BLACK = #000000ff
color COLOR_BLUE  = #013BCAff
color COLOR_CORAL = #FF8080ff
color COLOR_GOLD  = #CCCC00ff
```

## [Explicit typing](https://www.tradingview.com#explicit-typing)

Including the type of variables when declaring them is not required.
However, it helps make scripts easier to read, navigate, and understand.
It can help clarify the expected types at each point in a script's
execution and distinguish a variable's declaration (using `=`) from its
reassignments (using `:=`). Using explicit typing can also make scripts
easier to [debug](#debugging).

# [Debugging](https://www.tradingview.com#debugging)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

TradingView's close integration between the Pine Editor and the chart
interface facilitates efficient, interactive debugging of Pine Script™
code, as scripts can produce dynamic results in multiple locations, on
and off the chart. Programmers can utilize such results to refine their
script's behaviors and ensure everything works as expected.

When a programmer understands the appropriate techniques for inspecting
the variety of behaviors one may encounter while writing a script, they
can quickly and thoroughly identify and resolve potential problems in
their code, which allows for a more seamless overall coding experience.
This page demonstrates some of the handiest ways to debug code when
working with Pine Script™.

## [The lay of the land](https://www.tradingview.com#the-lay-of-the-land)

Pine scripts can output their results in multiple different ways, any of
which programmers can utilize for debugging.

The `plot*()` functions can display results in a chart pane, the
script's status line, the price (y-axis) scale, and the Data Window,
providing simple, convenient ways to debug numeric and conditional
values:

![image](images/Debugging-The-lay-of-the-land-1.BMFtSmLt_rnRYW.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("The lay of the land - Plots")

// Plot the `bar_index` in all available locations.
plot(bar_index, "bar_index", color.teal, 3)
```

Note that:

- A script's status line outputs will only show when enabling the
  "Values" checkbox within the "Indicators" section of the
  chart's "Status line" settings.
- Price scales will only show plot values or names when enabling
  the options from the "Indicators and financials" dropdown in
  the chart's "Scales and lines" settings.

The
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
function displays colors in the script pane's background, and the
[barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor)
function changes the colors of the main chart's bars or candles. Both
of these functions provide a simple way to visualize conditions:

![image](images/Debugging-The-lay-of-the-land-2.Dt_T7jt8_Zx7tBv.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("The lay of the land - Background and bar colors")

//@variable Is `true` if the `close` is rising over 2 bars.
bool risingPrice = ta.rising(close, 2)

// Highlight the chart background and color the main chart bars based on `risingPrice`.
bgcolor(risingPrice ? color.new(color.green, 70) : na, title= "`risingPrice` highlight")
barcolor(risingPrice ? color.aqua : chart.bg_color, title = "`risingPrice` bar color")
```

Pine's
[drawing types](#drawing-types) ([line](#lines), [box](#boxes), [polyline](#polylines), [label](#labels))
produce drawings in the script's pane. While they don't return results
in other locations, such as the status line or Data Window, they provide
alternative, flexible solutions for inspecting numeric values,
conditions, and strings directly on the chart:

![image](images/Debugging-The-lay-of-the-land-3.BR7JNYrd_Z2s1rX.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("The lay of the land - Drawings", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` when the time changes on the "1D" timeframe.
bool newDailyBar = timeframe.change("1D")
//@variable The previous bar's `bar_index` from when `newDailyBar` last occurred.
int closedIndex = ta.valuewhen(newDailyBar, bar_index - 1, 0)
//@variable The previous bar's `close` from when `newDailyBar` last occurred.
float closedPrice = ta.valuewhen(newDailyBar, close[1], 0)

if newDailyBar
    //@variable Draws a line from the previous `closedIndex` and `closedPrice` to the current values.
    line debugLine = line.new(closedIndex[1], closedPrice[1], closedIndex, closedPrice, width = 2)
    //@variable Variable info to display in a label.
    string debugText = "'1D' bar closed at: \n(" + str.tostring(closedIndex) + ", " + str.tostring(closedPrice) + ")"
    //@variable Draws a label at the current `closedIndex` and `closedPrice`.
    label.new(closedIndex, closedPrice, debugText, color = color.purple, textcolor = color.white)
```

The `log.*()` functions produce
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs)
results. Every time a script calls any of these functions, the script
logs a message in the
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane,
along with a timestamp and navigation options to identify the specific
times, chart bars, and lines of code that triggered a log:

![image](images/Debugging-The-lay-of-the-land-4.fSt39wX6_2urrNy.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("The lay of the land - Pine Logs")

//@variable The natural logarithm of the current `high - low` range.
float logRange = math.log(high - low)

// Plot the `logRange`.
plot(logRange, "logRange")

if barstate.isconfirmed
    // Generate an "error" or "info" message on the confirmed bar, depending on whether `logRange` is defined.
    switch 
        na(logRange) => log.error("Undefined `logRange` value.")
        =>              log.info("`logRange` value: " + str.tostring(logRange))
else
    // Generate a "warning" message for unconfirmed values.
    log.warning("Unconfirmed `logRange` value: " + str.tostring(logRange))
```

One can apply any of the above, or a combination, to establish debugging
routines to fit their needs and preferences, depending on the data types
and structures they're working with. See the sections below for
detailed explanations of various debugging techniques.

## [Numeric values](https://www.tradingview.com#numeric-values)

When creating code in Pine Script™, working with numbers is inevitable.
Therefore, to ensure a script works as intended, it's crucial to
understand how to inspect the numeric
([int](#int) and
[float](#float))
values it receives and calculates.

### [Plotting numbers](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting-numbers)

One of the most straightforward ways to inspect a script's numeric
values is to use `plot*()` functions, which can display results
graphically on the chart and show formatted numbers in the script's
status line, the price scale, and the Data Window. The locations where a
`plot*()` function displays its results depend on the `display`
parameter. By default, its value is
[display.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_display.all).

The following example uses the
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
function to display the 1-bar change in the value of the built-in
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
variable measured in chart timeframes (e.g., a plotted value of 1 on the
"1D" chart means there is a one-day difference between the opening
times of the current and previous bars). Inspecting this series can help
to identify time gaps in a chart's data, which is helpful information
when designing time-based indicators.

Since we have not specified a `display` argument, the function uses
[display.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_display.all),
meaning it will show data in *all* possible locations, as we see below:

![image](images/Debugging-Numeric-values-Plotting-numbers-1.CPWsJyU1_26SArq.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting numbers demo", "Time changes")

//@variable The one-bar change in the chart symbol's `time` value, measured in units of the chart timeframe.
float timeChange = ta.change(time) / (1000.0 * timeframe.in_seconds())

// Display the `timeChange` in all possible locations.
plot(timeChange, "Time difference (in chart bar units)", color.purple, 3)
```

Note that:

- The numbers displayed in the script's status line and the Data
  Window reflect the plotted values at the location of the
  chart's cursor. These areas will show the latest bar's value
  when the mouse pointer isn't on the chart.
- The number in the price scale reflects the latest available
  value on the visible chart.

#### [Without affecting the scale](https://www.tradingview.com#without-affecting-the-scale)

When debugging multiple numeric values in a script, programmers may wish
to inspect them without interfering with the price scales or cluttering
the visual outputs in the chart's pane, as distorted scales and
overlapping plots may make it harder to evaluate the results.

A simple way to inspect numbers without adding more visuals to the
chart's pane is to change the `display` values in the script's
`plot*()` calls to other `display.*` variables or expressions using
them.

Let's look at a practical example. Here, we've drafted the following
script that calculates a custom-weighted moving average by dividing the
[sum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sum)
of `weight * close` values by the
[sum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sum)
of the `weight` series:

![image](images/Debugging-Numeric-values-Plotting-numbers-Without-affecting-the-scale-1.D9lHNsXL_mUjuG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting without affecting the scale demo", "Weighted Average", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the average.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1)

//@variable The weight applied to the price on each bar.
float weight = math.pow(close - open, 2)

//@variable The numerator of the average.
float numerator = math.sum(weight * close, lengthInput)
//@variable The denominator of the average.
float denominator = math.sum(weight, lengthInput)

//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar weighted average.
float average = numerator / denominator

// Plot the `average`.
plot(average, "Weighted Average", linewidth = 3)
```

Suppose we'd like to inspect the variables used in the `average`
calculation to understand and fine-tune the result. If we were to use
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
to display the script's `weight`, `numerator`, and `denominator` in all
locations, we can no longer easily identify our `average` line on the
chart since each variable has a radically different scale:

![image](images/Debugging-Numeric-values-Plotting-numbers-Without-affecting-the-scale-2.CNBE_Mtb_2rATc4.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting without affecting the scale demo", "Weighted Average", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the average.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1)

//@variable The weight applied to the price on each bar.
float weight = math.pow(close - open, 2)

//@variable The numerator of the average.
float numerator = math.sum(close * weight, lengthInput)
//@variable The denominator of the average.
float denominator = math.sum(weight, lengthInput)

//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar weighted average.
float average = numerator / denominator

// Plot the `average`.
plot(average, "Weighted Average", linewidth = 3)

// Create debug plots for the `weight`, `numerator`, and `denominator`.
plot(weight, "weight", color.purple)
plot(numerator, "numerator", color.teal)
plot(denominator, "denominator", color.maroon)
```

While we could hide individual plots from the "Style" tab of the
script's settings, doing so also prevents us from inspecting the
results in any other location. To simultaneously view the variables'
values and preserve the scale of our chart, we can change the `display`
values in our debug plots.

The version below includes a `debugLocations` variable in the debug
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
calls with a value of `display.all - display.pane` to specify that all
locations *except* the chart pane will show the results. Now we can
inspect the calculation's values without the extra clutter:

![image](images/Debugging-Numeric-values-Plotting-numbers-Without-affecting-the-scale-3.iomfmsC__26l9R3.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting without affecting the scale demo", "Weighted Average", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the average.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1)

//@variable The weight applied to the price on each bar.
float weight = math.pow(close - open, 2)

//@variable The numerator of the average.
float numerator = math.sum(close * weight, lengthInput)
//@variable The denominator of the average.
float denominator = math.sum(weight, lengthInput)

//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar weighted average.
float average = numerator / denominator

// Plot the `average`.
plot(average, "Weighted Average", linewidth = 3)

//@variable The display locations of all debug plots.
debugLocations = display.all - display.pane
// Create debug plots for the `weight`, `numerator`, and `denominator`.
plot(weight, "weight", color.purple, display = debugLocations)
plot(numerator, "numerator", color.teal, display = debugLocations)
plot(denominator, "denominator", color.maroon, display = debugLocations)
```

#### [From local scopes](https://www.tradingview.com#from-local-scopes)

A script's *local scopes* are sections of indented code within
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures),
[functions](#user-defined-functions),
and [methods](#user-defined-methods). When working with variables declared within these scopes,
using the `plot*()` functions to display their values directly *will
not* work, as plots only work with literals and *global* variables.

To display a local variable's values using plots, one can assign its
results to a global variable and pass that variable to the `plot*()`
call.

For example, this script calculates the all-time maximum and minimum
change in the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price over a `lengthInput` period. It uses an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure to declare a local `change` variable and update the global
`maxChange` and `minChange` once every `lengthInput` bars:

![image](images/Debugging-Numeric-values-Plotting-numbers-From-local-scopes-1.DEllI76K_2tIueB.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting numbers from local scopes demo", "Periodic changes")

//@variable The number of chart bars in each period.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Period length", 1)

//@variable The maximum `close` change over each `lengthInput` period on the chart.
var float maxChange = na
//@variable The minimum `close` change over each `lengthInput` period on the chart.
var float minChange = na

//@variable Is `true` once every `lengthInput` bars.
bool periodClose = bar_index % lengthInput == 0

if periodClose
    //@variable The change in `close` prices over `lengthInput` bars.
    float change = close - close[lengthInput]
    // Update the global `maxChange` and `minChange`.
    maxChange := math.max(nz(maxChange, change), change)
    minChange := math.min(nz(minChange, change), change)

// Plot the `maxChange` and `minChange`.
plot(maxChange, "Max periodic change", color.teal, 3)
plot(minChange, "Min periodic change", color.maroon, 3)
hline(0.0, color = color.gray, linestyle = hline.style_solid)
```

Suppose we want to inspect the history of the `change` variable using a
plot. While we cannot plot the variable directly since the script
declares it in a local scope, we can assign its value to another
*global* variable for use in a `plot*()` function.

Below, we've added a `debugChange` variable with an initial value of
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) to
the global scope, and the script reassigns its value within the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure using the local `change` variable. Now, we can use
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
with the `debugChange` variable to view the history of available
`change` values:

![image](images/Debugging-Numeric-values-Plotting-numbers-From-local-scopes-2.CPaEqcWa_i20qC.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting numbers from local scopes demo", "Periodic changes")

//@variable The number of chart bars in each period.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Period length", 1)

//@variable The maximum `close` change over each `lengthInput` period on the chart.
var float maxChange = na
//@variable The minimum `close` change over each `lengthInput` period on the chart.
var float minChange = na

//@variable Is `true` once every `lengthInput` bars.
bool periodClose = bar_index % lengthInput == 0

//@variable Tracks the history of the local `change` variable.
float debugChange = na

if periodClose
    //@variable The change in `close` prices over `lengthInput` bars.
    float change = close - close[lengthInput]
    // Update the global `maxChange` and `minChange`.
    maxChange := math.max(nz(maxChange, change), change)
    minChange := math.min(nz(minChange, change), change)
    // Assign the `change` value to the `debugChange` variable.
    debugChange := change

// Plot the `maxChange` and `minChange`.
plot(maxChange, "Max periodic change", color.teal, 3)
plot(minChange, "Min periodic change", color.maroon, 3)
hline(0.0, color = color.gray, linestyle = hline.style_solid)

// Create a debug plot to visualize the `change` history.
plot(debugChange, "Extracted change", color.purple, 15, plot.style_areabr)
```

Note that:

- The script uses
  [plot.style_areabr](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_plot.style_areabr)
  in the debug plot, which doesn't bridge over
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  values as the default style does.
- When the rightmost visible bar's plotted value is
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  the number in the price scale represents the latest *non-na*
  value before that bar, if one exists.

### [With drawings](https://www.tradingview.com#with-drawings)

An alternative approach to graphically inspecting the history of a
script's numeric values is to use Pine's
[drawing types](#drawing-types), including
[lines](#lines),
[boxes](#boxes),
[polylines](#polylines),
and [labels](#labels).

While Pine drawings don't display results anywhere other than the chart
pane, scripts can create them from within *local scopes*, including the
scopes of [functions](#user-defined-functions) and
[methods](#user-defined-methods)
(see the
[Debugging functions](#debugging-functions) section to learn more). Additionally, scripts can position
drawings at *any* available chart location, irrespective of the current
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).

For example, let's revisit the "Periodic changes" script from the
[previous section](#from-local-scopes). Suppose we'd like to inspect the history of the local
`change` variable *without* using a plot. In this case, we can avoid
declaring a separate global variable and instead create drawing objects
directly from the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure's local scope.

The script below is a modification of the previous script that uses
[boxes](#boxes) to
visualize the `change` variable's behavior. Inside the scope of the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure, it calls
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
to create a
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
that spans from the bar `lengthInput` bars ago to the current
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index):

![image](images/Debugging-Numeric-values-With-drawings-1.DsvQ-qM2_Z2i05an.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Drawing numbers from local scopes demo", "Periodic changes", max_boxes_count = 500)

//@variable The number of chart bars in each period.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Period length", 1)

//@variable The maximum `close` change over each `lengthInput` period on the chart.
var float maxChange = na
//@variable The minimum `close` change over each `lengthInput` period on the chart.
var float minChange = na

//@variable Is `true` once every `lengthInput` bars.
bool periodClose = bar_index % lengthInput == 0

if periodClose
    //@variable The change in `close` prices over `lengthInput` bars.
    float change = close - close[lengthInput]
    // Update the global `maxChange` and `minChange`.
    maxChange := math.max(nz(maxChange, change), change)
    minChange := math.min(nz(minChange, change), change)
    //@variable Draws a box on the chart to visualize the `change` value.
    box debugBox = box.new(
         bar_index - lengthInput, math.max(change, 0.0), bar_index, math.min(change, 0.0),
         color.purple, bgcolor = color.new(color.purple, 80), text = str.tostring(change)
     )

// Plot the `maxChange` and `minChange`.
plot(maxChange, "Max periodic change", color.teal, 3)
plot(minChange, "Min periodic change", color.maroon, 3)
hline(0.0, color = color.gray, linestyle = hline.style_solid)
```

Note that:

- The script includes `max_boxes_count = 500` in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function, which allows it to show up to 500
  [boxes](#boxes)
  on the chart.
- We used [math.max(change,
  0.0)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.max)
  and [math.min(change,
  0.0)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.min)
  in the
  [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
  function as the `top` and `bottom` values.
- The
  [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
  call includes
  [str.tostring(change)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
  as its `text` argument to display a *"string" representation*
  of the `change` variable's "float" value in each
  [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
  drawing. See
  [this](#representing-other-types) portion of the
  [Strings](#strings)
  section below to learn more about representing data with
  strings.

For more information about using
[boxes](#boxes) and
other related
[drawing types](#drawing-types), see our User Manual's
[Lines and boxes](#lines-and-boxes)
page.

## [Conditions](https://www.tradingview.com#conditions)

Many scripts one will create in Pine involve declaring and evaluating
*conditions* to dictate specific script actions, such as triggering
different calculation patterns, visuals, signals, alerts, strategy
orders, etc. As such, it's imperative to understand how to inspect the
conditions a script uses to ensure proper execution.

### [As numbers](https://www.tradingview.com#as-numbers)

One possible way to debug a script's conditions is to define *numeric
values* based on them, which allows programmers to inspect them using
numeric approaches, such as those outlined in the
[previous section](#numeric-values).

Let's look at a simple example. This script calculates the ratio
between the
[ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4)
price and the `lengthInput`-bar [moving
average](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma).
It assigns a condition to the `priceAbove` variable that returns `true`
whenever the value of the ratio exceeds 1 (i.e., the price is above the
average).

To inspect the occurrences of the condition, we created a `debugValue`
variable assigned to the result of an expression that uses the ternary
[?:](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_?:)
operator to return 1 when `priceAbove` is `true` and 0 otherwise. The
script plots the variable's value in all available locations:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-As-numbers-1.BoeptaNB_2nR2E8.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditions as numbers demo", "MA signal")

//@variable The number of bars in the moving average calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1)

//@variable The ratio of the `ohlc4` price to its `lengthInput`-bar moving average.
float ratio = ohlc4 / ta.sma(ohlc4, lengthInput)

//@variable The condition to inspect. Is `true` when `ohlc4` is above its moving average, `false` otherwise.
bool priceAbove = ratio > 1.0
//@variable Returns 1 when the `priceAbove` condition is `true`, 0 otherwise.
int debugValue = priceAbove ? 1 : 0

// Plot the `debugValue.
plot(debugValue, "Conditional number", color.teal, 3)
```

Note that:

- Representing "bool" values using numbers also allows scripts
  to display conditional shapes or characters at specific y-axis
  locations with
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  and
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar),
  and it facilitates conditional debugging with
  [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow).
  See the
  [next section](#plotting-conditional-shapes) to learn more.

### [Plotting conditional shapes](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting-conditional-shapes)

The
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
and
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
functions provide utility for debugging conditions, as they can plot
shapes or characters at absolute or relative chart locations whenever
they contain a `true` or non-na `series` argument.

These functions can also display *numeric* representations of the
`series` in the script's status line and the Data Window, meaning
they're also helpful for debugging
[numbers](#numeric-values).
We show a simple, practical way to debug numbers with these functions in
the [Tips](#tips) section.

The chart locations of the plots depend on the `location` parameter,
which is
[location.abovebar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_location.abovebar)
by default.

Let's inspect a condition using these functions. The following script
calculates an
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi)
with a `lengthInput` length and a `crossBelow` variable whose value is
the result of a condition that returns `true` when the RSI crosses below
30. It calls
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
to display a circle near the top of the pane each time the condition
occurs:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Plotting-conditional-shapes-1.B_YUlhVQ_Z1ARRXr.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional shapes demo", "RSI cross under 30")

//@variable The length of the RSI.
int lengthInput = input.int(14, "Length", 1)

//@variable The calculated RSI value.
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, lengthInput)

//@variable Is `true` when the `rsi` crosses below 30, `false` otherwise.
bool crossBelow = ta.crossunder(rsi, 30.0)

// Plot the `rsi`.
plot(rsi, "RSI", color.rgb(136, 76, 146), linewidth = 3)
// Plot the `crossBelow` condition as circles near the top of the pane.
plotshape(crossBelow, "RSI crossed below 30", shape.circle, location.top, color.red, size = size.small)
```

Note that:

- The status line and Data Window show a value of 1 when
  `crossBelow` is `true` and 0 when it's `false`.

Suppose we'd like to display the shapes at *precise* locations rather
than relative to the chart pane. We can achieve this by using
[conditional numbers](#as-numbers) and
[location.absolute](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_location.absolute)
in the
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
call.

In this example, we've modified the previous script by creating a
`debugNumber` variable that returns the `rsi` value when `crossBelow` is
`true` and
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
otherwise. The
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
function uses this new variable as its `series` argument and
[location.absolute](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_location.absolute)
as its `location` argument:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Plotting-conditional-shapes-2.Daveblc1_ZgMwC0.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional shapes demo", "RSI cross under 30")

//@variable The length of the RSI.
int lengthInput = input.int(14, "Length", 1)

//@variable The calculated RSI value.
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, lengthInput)

//@variable Is `true` when the `rsi` crosses below 30, `false` otherwise.
bool crossBelow = ta.crossunder(rsi, 30.0)
//@variable Returns the `rsi` when `crossBelow` is `true`, `na` otherwise.
float debugNumber = crossBelow ? rsi : na

// Plot the `rsi`.
plot(rsi, "RSI", color.rgb(136, 76, 146), linewidth = 3)
// Plot circles at the `debugNumber`.
plotshape(debugNumber, "RSI when it crossed below 30", shape.circle, location.absolute, color.red, size = size.small)
```

Note that:

- Since we passed a *numeric* series to the function, our
  conditional plot now shows the values of the `debugNumber` in
  the status line and Data Window instead of 1 or 0.

Another handy way to debug conditions is to use
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow).
This function plots an arrow with a location relative to the *main chart
prices* whenever the `series` argument is nonzero and not
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na). The
length of each arrow varies with the `series` value supplied. As with
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
and
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar),
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
can also display numeric results in the status line and the Data Window.

This example shows an alternative way to inspect our `crossBelow`
condition using
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow).
In this version, we've set `overlay` to `true` in the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
function and added a
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
call to visualize the conditional values. The `debugNumber` in this
example measures how far the `rsi` dropped below 30 each time the
condition occurs:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Plotting-conditional-shapes-3.IZzMwtM0_Z1HvpVm.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional shapes demo", "RSI cross under 30", true)

//@variable The length of the RSI.
int lengthInput = input.int(14, "Length", 1)

//@variable The calculated RSI value.
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, lengthInput)

//@variable Is `true` when the `rsi` crosses below 30, `false` otherwise.
bool crossBelow = ta.crossunder(rsi, 30.0)
//@variable Returns `rsi - 30.0` when `crossBelow` is `true`, `na` otherwise.
float debugNumber = crossBelow ? rsi - 30.0 : na

// Plot the `rsi`.
plot(rsi, "RSI", color.rgb(136, 76, 146), display = display.data_window)
// Plot circles at the `debugNumber`.
plotarrow(debugNumber, "RSI cross below 30 distnce")
```

Note that:

- We set the `display` value in the
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  of the `rsi` to
  [display.data_window](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_display.data_window)
  to
  [preserve the chart's scale](#without-affecting-the-scale).

[Text and shapes](#text-and-shapes)
page.

### [Conditional colors](https://www.tradingview.com#conditional-colors)

An elegant way to visually represent conditions in Pine is to create
expressions that return
[color](#color)
values based on `true` or `false` states, as scripts can use them to
control the appearance of
[drawing objects](#drawing-types) or the results of `plot*()`,
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill),
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor),
or
[barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor)
calls.

For example, this script calculates the change in
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
prices over `lengthInput` bars and declares two "bool" variables to
identify when the price change is positive or negative.

The script uses these "bool" values as conditions in
[ternary](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_?:)
expressions to assign the values of three "color" variables, then uses
those variables as the `color` arguments in
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot),
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor),
and
[barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor)
to debug the results:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Conditional-colors-1.B5Y6dhKf_Z1jtyTu.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional colors demo", "Price change colors")

//@variable The number of bars in the price change calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(10, "Length", 1)

//@variable The change in `close` prices over `lengthInput` bars.
float priceChange = ta.change(close, lengthInput)

//@variable Is `true` when the `priceChange` is a positive value, `false` otherwise.
bool isPositive = priceChange > 0
//@variable Is `true` when the `priceChange` is a negative value, `false` otherwise.
bool isNegative = priceChange < 0

//@variable Returns a color for the `priceChange` plot to show when `isPositive`, `isNegative`, or neither occurs.
color plotColor = isPositive ? color.teal : isNegative ? color.maroon : chart.fg_color
//@variable Returns an 80% transparent color for the background when `isPositive` or `isNegative`, `na` otherwise.
color bgColor = isPositive ? color.new(color.aqua, 80) : isNegative ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na
//@variable Returns a color to emphasize chart bars when `isPositive` occurs. Otherwise, returns the `chart.bg_color`.
color barColor = isPositive ? color.orange : chart.bg_color

// Plot the `priceChange` and color it with the `plotColor`.
plot(priceChange, "Price change", plotColor, style = plot.style_area)
// Highlight the pane's background with the `bgColor`.
bgcolor(bgColor, title = "Background highlight")
// Emphasize the chart bars with positive price change using the `barColor`.
barcolor(barColor, title = "Positive change bars")
```

Note that:

- The
  [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor)
  function always colors the main chart's bars, regardless of
  whether the script occupies another chart pane, and the chart
  will only display the results if the bars are visible.

See the [Colors](#colors),
[Fills](#fills),
[Backgrounds](#backgrounds), and
[Bar coloring](#bar-coloring) pages for
more information about working with colors, filling plots, highlighting
backgrounds, and coloring bars.

### [Using drawings](https://www.tradingview.com#using-drawings)

Pine Script™'s
[drawing types](#drawing-types) provide flexible ways to visualize conditions on the chart,
especially when the conditions are within local scopes.

Consider the following script, which calculates a custom `filter` with a
smoothing parameter (`alpha`) that changes its value within an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure based on recent
[volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume)
conditions:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Using-drawings-1.bqLda39j_Z13aGwI.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional drawings demo", "Volume-based filter", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the volume average.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Volume average length", 1)

//@variable The average `volume` over `lengthInput` bars.
float avgVolume = ta.sma(volume, lengthInput)

//@variable A custom price filter based on volume activity.
float filter = close
//@variable The smoothing parameter of the filter calculation. Its value depends on multiple volume conditions.
float alpha = na

// Set the `alpha` to 1 if `volume` exceeds its `lengthInput`-bar moving average.
if volume > avgVolume
    alpha := 1.0
// Set the `alpha` to 0.5 if `volume` exceeds its previous value.
else if volume > volume[1]
    alpha := 0.5
// Set the `alpha` to 0.01 otherwise.
else
    alpha := 0.01

// Calculate the new `filter` value.
filter := (1.0 - alpha) * nz(filter[1], filter) + alpha * close

// Plot the `filter`.
plot(filter, "Filter", linewidth = 3)
```

Suppose we'd like to inspect the conditions that control the `alpha`
value. There are several ways we could approach the task with chart
visuals. However, some approaches will involve more code and careful
handling.

For example, to visualize the
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure's conditions using
[plotted shapes](#plotting-conditional-shapes) or
[background colors](#conditional-colors), we'd have to create additional variables or expressions in
the global scope for the `plot*()` or
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
functions to access.

Alternatively, we can use
[drawing types](#drawing-types) to visualize the conditions concisely without those extra
steps.

The following is a modification of the previous script that calls
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new)
within specific branches of the
[conditional structure](#conditional-structures) to draw
[labels](#labels) on the
chart whenever those branches execute. These simple changes allow us to
identify those conditions on the chart without much extra code:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Using-drawings-2.6tfkMr81_1G1BSn.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Conditional drawings demo", "Volume-based filter", true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the volume average.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Volume average length", 1)

//@variable The average `volume` over `lengthInput` bars.
float avgVolume = ta.sma(volume, lengthInput)

//@variable A custom price filter based on volume activity.
float filter = close
//@variable The smoothing parameter of the filter calculation. Its value depends on multiple volume conditions.
float alpha = na

// Set the `alpha` to 1 if `volume` exceeds its `lengthInput`-bar moving average.
if volume > avgVolume
    // Add debug label.
    label.new(chart.point.now(high), "alpha = 1", color = color.teal, textcolor = color.white)
    alpha := 1.0
// Set the `alpha` to 0.5 if `volume` exceeds its previous value.
else if volume > volume[1]
    // Add debug label.
    label.new(chart.point.now(high), "alpha = 0.5", color = color.green, textcolor = color.white)
    alpha := 0.5
// Set the `alpha` to 0.01 otherwise.
else
    alpha := 0.01

// Calculate the new `filter` value.
filter := (1.0 - alpha) * nz(filter[1], filter) + alpha * close

// Plot the `filter`.
plot(filter, "Filter", linewidth = 3)
```

Note that:

- We added the
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new)
  calls *above* the `alpha` reassignment expressions, as the
  returned types of each branch in the
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  structure must match.
- The
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function includes `max_labels_count = 500` to specify that the
  script can show up to 500
  [labels](#labels) on the chart.

### [Compound and nested conditions](https://www.tradingview.com#compound-and-nested-conditions)

When a programmer needs to identify situations where more than one
condition can occur, they may construct *compound conditions* by
aggregating individual conditions with logical operators
([and](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_and),
[or](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_or)).

For example, this line of code shows a `compoundCondition` variable that
only returns `true` if `condition1` and either `condition2` or
`condition3` occurs:

```
bool compoundCondition = condition1 and (condition2 or condition3)
```

One may alternatively create *nested conditions* using
[conditional structures](#conditional-structures) or [ternary
expressions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_?:).
For example, this
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure assigns `true` to the `nestedCondition` variable if
`condition1` and `condition2` or `condition3` occurs. However, unlike
the logical expression above, the branches of this structure also allow
the script to execute additional code before assigning the "bool"
value:

```
bool nestedCondition = false

if condition1
    // [additional_code]
    if condition2
        // [additional_code]
        nestedCondition := true
    else if condition3
        // [additional_code]
        nestedCondition := true
```

In either case, whether working with compound or nested conditions in
code, one will save many headaches and ensure they work as expected by
validating the behaviors of the *individual conditions* that compose
them.

For example, this script calculates an `rsi` and the `median` of the
`rsi` over `lengthInput` bars. Then, it creates five variables to
represent different singular conditions. The script uses these variables
in a logical expression to assign a "bool" value to the
`compoundCondition` variable, and it displays the results of the
`compoundCondition` using a
[conditional background color](#conditional-colors):

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Compound-conditions-1.BIlbHbn5_Z1hVb8A.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Compound conditions demo")

//@variable The length of the RSI and median RSI calculations.
int lengthInput = input.int(14, "Length", 2)

//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar RSI.
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar median of the `rsi`.
float median = ta.median(rsi, lengthInput)

//@variable Condition #1: Is `true` when the 1-bar `rsi` change switches from 1 to -1.
bool changeNegative = ta.change(math.sign(ta.change(rsi))) == -2
//@variable Condition #2: Is `true` when the previous bar's `rsi` is greater than 70.
bool prevAbove70 = rsi[1] > 70.0
//@variable Condition #3: Is `true` when the current `close` is lower than the previous bar's `open`.
bool closeBelow = close < open[1]
//@variable Condition #4: Is `true` when the `rsi` is between 60 and 70.
bool betweenLevels = bool(math.max(70.0 - rsi, 0.0) * math.max(rsi - 60.0, 0.0))
//@variable Condition #5: Is `true` when the `rsi` is above the `median`.
bool aboveMedian = rsi > median

//@variable Is `true` when the first condition occurs alongside conditions 2 and 3 or 4 and 5.
bool compundCondition = changeNegative and ((prevAbove70 and closeBelow) or (betweenLevels and aboveMedian))

//Plot the `rsi` and the `median`.
plot(rsi, "RSI", color.rgb(201, 109, 34), 3)
plot(median, "RSI Median", color.rgb(180, 160, 102), 2)

// Highlight the background red when the `compundCondition` occurs.
bgcolor(compundCondition ? color.new(color.red, 60) : na, title = "compundCondition")
```

As we see above, it's not necessarily easy to understand the behavior
of the `compoundCondition` by only visualizing its end result, as five
underlying singular conditions determine the final value. To effectively
debug the `compoundCondition` in this case, we must also inspect the
conditions that compose it.

In the example below, we've added five
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
calls to display
[characters](#plotting-conditional-shapes) on the chart and numeric values in the status line and Data
Window when each singular condition occurs. Inspecting each of these
results provides us with more complete information about the
`compoundCondition`'s behavior:

![image](images/Debugging-Conditions-Compound-conditions-2.CqS0Ugyz_Z181FHW.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Compound conditions demo")

//@variable The length of the RSI and median RSI calculations.
int lengthInput = input.int(14, "Length", 2)

//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar RSI.
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The `lengthInput`-bar median of the `rsi`.
float median = ta.median(rsi, lengthInput)

//@variable Condition #1: Is `true` when the 1-bar `rsi` change switches from 1 to -1.
bool changeNegative = ta.change(math.sign(ta.change(rsi))) == -2
//@variable Condition #2: Is `true` when the previous bar's `rsi` is greater than 70.
bool prevAbove70 = rsi[1] > 70.0
//@variable Condition #3: Is `true` when the current `close` is lower than the previous bar's `open`.
bool closeBelow = close < open[1]
//@variable Condition #4: Is `true` when the `rsi` is between 60 and 70.
bool betweenLevels = bool(math.max(70.0 - rsi, 0.0) * math.max(rsi - 60.0, 0.0))
//@variable Condition #5: Is `true` when the `rsi` is above the `median`.
bool aboveMedian = rsi > median

//@variable Is `true` when the first condition occurs alongside conditions 2 and 3 or 4 and 5.
bool compundCondition = changeNegative and ((prevAbove70 and closeBelow) or (betweenLevels and aboveMedian))

//Plot the `rsi` and the `median`.
plot(rsi, "RSI", color.rgb(201, 109, 34), 3)
plot(median, "RSI Median", color.rgb(180, 160, 102), 2)

// Highlight the background red when the `compundCondition` occurs.
bgcolor(compundCondition ? color.new(color.red, 60) : na, title = "compundCondition")

// Plot characters on the chart when conditions 1-5 occur.
plotchar(changeNegative ? rsi : na, "changeNegative (1)", "1", location.absolute, chart.fg_color)
plotchar(prevAbove70 ? 70.0 : na, "prevAbove70 (2)", "2", location.absolute, chart.fg_color)
plotchar(closeBelow ? close : na, "closeBelow (3)", "3", location.bottom, chart.fg_color)
plotchar(betweenLevels ? 60 : na, "betweenLevels (4)", "4", location.absolute, chart.fg_color)
plotchar(aboveMedian ? median : na, "aboveMedian (5)", "5", location.absolute, chart.fg_color)
```

Note that:

- Each
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  call uses a
  [conditional number](#as-numbers) as the `series` argument. The functions display the
  numeric values in the status line and Data Window.
- All the
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  calls, excluding the one for the `closeBelow` condition, use
  [location.absolute](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_location.absolute)
  as the `location` argument to display characters at precise
  locations whenever their `series` is not
  [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
  (i.e., the condition occurs). The call for `closeBelow` uses
  [location.bottom](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_location.bottom)
  to display its characters near the bottom of the pane.
- In this section's examples, we assigned individual conditions
  to separate variables with straightforward names and
  annotations. While this format isn't required to create a
  compound condition since one can combine conditions directly
  within a logical expression, it makes for more readable code
  that's easier to debug, as explained in the
  [Tips](#tips)
  section.

## [Strings](https://www.tradingview.com#strings)

[Strings](#string)
are sequences of alphanumeric, control, and other characters (e.g.,
Unicode). They provide utility when debugging scripts, as programmers
can use them to represent a script's data types as human-readable text
and inspect them with
[drawing types](#drawing-types) that have text-related properties, or by using
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs).

### [Representing other types](https://www.tradingview.com#representing-other-types)

Users can create "string" representations of virtually any data type,
facilitating effective debugging when other approaches may not suffice.
Before exploring "string" inspection techniques, let's briefly review
ways to *represent* a script's data using strings.

Pine Script™ includes predefined logic to construct "string"
representations of several other built-in types, such as
[int](#int),
[float](#float),
[bool](#bool),
[array](#arrays), and
[matrix](#matrices). Scripts can
conveniently represent such types as strings via the
[str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
and
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
functions.

For example, this snippet creates strings to represent multiple values
using these functions:

```
//@variable Returns: "1.25"
string floatRepr = str.tostring(1.25)
//@variable Returns: "1"
string rounded0 = str.tostring(1.25, "#")
//@variable Returns: "1.3"
string rounded1 = str.tostring(1.25, "#.#")
//@variable Returns: "1.2500"
string trailingZeros = str.tostring(1.25, "#.0000")
//@variable Returns: "true"
string trueRepr = str.tostring(true)
//@variable Returns: "false"
string falseRepr = str.tostring(5 == 3)
//@variable Returns: "[1, 2, -3.14]"
string floatArrayRepr = str.tostring(array.from(1, 2.0, -3.14))
//@variable Returns: "[2, 20, 0]"
string roundedArrayRepr = str.tostring(array.from(2.22, 19.6, -0.43), "#")
//@variable Returns: "[Hello, World, !]"
string stringArrayRepr = str.tostring(array.from("Hello", "World", "!"))
//@variable Returns: "Test: 2.718 ^ 2 > 5: true"
string mixedTypeRepr = str.format("{0}{1, number, #.###} ^ 2 > {2}: {3}", "Test: ", math.e, 5, math.e * math.e > 5)

//@variable Combines all the above strings into a multi-line string.
string combined = str.format(
     "{0}\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n{4}\n{5}\n{6}\n{7}\n{8}\n{9}",
     floatRepr, rounded0, rounded1, trailingZeros, trueRepr,
     falseRepr, floatArrayRepr, roundedArrayRepr, stringArrayRepr,
     mixedTypeRepr
 )
```

When working with "int" values that symbolize UNIX timestamps, such as
those returned from time-related functions and variables, one can also
use
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
or
[str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format_time)
to convert them to human-readable date strings. This code block
demonstrates multiple ways to convert a timestamp using these functions:

```
//@variable A UNIX timestamp, in milliseconds.
int unixTime = 1279411200000

//@variable Returns: "2010-07-18T00:00:00+0000"
string default = str.format_time(unixTime)
//@variable Returns: "2010-07-18"
string ymdRepr = str.format_time(unixTime, "yyyy-MM-dd")
//@variable Returns: "07-18-2010"
string mdyRepr = str.format_time(unixTime, "MM-dd-yyyy")
//@variable Returns: "20:00:00, 2010-07-17"
string hmsymdRepr = str.format_time(unixTime, "HH:mm:ss, yyyy-MM-dd", "America/New_York")
//@variable Returns: "Year: 2010, Month: 07, Day: 18, Time: 12:00:00"
string customFormat = str.format(
     "Year: {0, time, yyyy}, Month: {1, time, MM}, Day: {2, time, dd}, Time: {3, time, hh:mm:ss}",
     unixTime, unixTime, unixTime, unixTime
 )
```

When working with types that *don't* have built-in "string"
representations, e.g.,
[color](#color),
[map](#maps),
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types), etc., programmers can use custom logic or formatting to
construct representations. For example, this code calls
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
to represent a "color" value using its
[r](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.r),
[g](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.g),
[b](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.b),
and
[t](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.t)
components:

```
//@variable The built-in `color.maroon` value with 17% transparency.
color myColor = color.new(color.maroon, 17)

// Get the red, green, blue, and transparency components from `myColor`.
float r = color.r(myColor)
float g = color.g(myColor)
float b = color.b(myColor)
float t = color.t(myColor)

//@variable Returns: "color (r = 136, g = 14, b = 79, t = 17)"
string customRepr = str.format("color (r = {0}, g = {1}, b = {2}, t = {3})", r, g, b, t)
```

There are countless ways one can represent data using strings. When
choosing string formats for debugging, ensure the results are
**readable** and provide enough information for proper inspection. The
following segments explain ways to validate strings by displaying them
on the chart using [labels](#labels), and
the section after these segments explains how to display strings as
messages in the [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane.

### [Using labels](https://www.tradingview.com#using-labels)

[Labels](#labels) allow
scripts to display dynamic text ("series strings") at any available
location on the chart. Where to display such text on the chart depends
on the information the programmer wants to inspect and their debugging
preferences.

#### [On successive bars](https://www.tradingview.com#on-successive-bars)

When inspecting the history of values that affect the chart's scale or
working with multiple series that have different types, a simple, handy
debugging approach is to draw
[labels](#labels) that
display
[string representations](#representing-other-types) on successive bars.

For example, this script calculates four series: `highestClose`,
`percentRank`, `barsSinceHigh`, and `isLow`. It uses
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
to create a formatted "string" representing the series values and a
timestamp, then it calls
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new)
to draw a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
that display the results at the
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
on each bar:

![image](images/Debugging-Strings-Using-labels-On-successive-bars-1.QDEDvANn_xLWsm.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Labels on successive bars demo", "Inspecting multiple series", true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 1)

//@variable The highest `close` over `lengthInput` bars.
float highestClose = ta.highest(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The percent rank of the current `close` compared to previous values over `lengthInput` bars.
float percentRank = ta.percentrank(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The number of bars since the `close` was equal to the `highestClose`.
int barsSinceHigh = ta.barssince(close == highestClose)
//@variable Is `true` when the `percentRank` is 0, i.e., when the `close` is the lowest.
bool isLow = percentRank == 0.0

//@variable A multi-line string representing the `time`, `highestClose`, `percentRank`, `barsSinceHigh`, and `isLow`.
string debugString = str.format(
     "time (GMT): {0, time, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss}\nhighestClose: {1, number, #.####}
     \npercentRank: {2, number, #.##}%\nbarsSinceHigh: {3, number, integer}\nisLow: {4}",
     time, highestClose, percentRank, barsSinceHigh, isLow
 )

//@variable Draws a label showing the `debugString` at each bar's `high`.
label debugLabel = label.new(chart.point.now(high), debugString, textcolor = color.white)
```

While the above example allows one to inspect the results of the
script's series on any bar with a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
drawing, consecutive drawings like these can clutter the chart,
especially when viewing longer strings.

An alternative, more visually compact way to inspect successive bars'
values with [labels](#labels) is to utilize the `tooltip` property instead of the `text`
property, as a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
will only show its tooltip when the cursor *hovers* over it.

Below, we've modified the previous script by using the `debugString` as
the `tooltip` argument instead of the `text` argument in the
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new)
call. Now, we can view the results on specific bars without the extra
noise:

![image](images/Debugging-Strings-Using-labels-On-successive-bars-2.GO5WpodJ_Z1KqWXN.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Tooltips on successive bars demo", "Inspecting multiple series", true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 1)

//@variable The highest `close` over `lengthInput` bars.
float highestClose = ta.highest(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The percent rank of the current `close` compared to previous values over `lengthInput` bars.
float percentRank = ta.percentrank(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The number of bars since the `close` was equal to the `highestClose`.
int barsSinceHigh = ta.barssince(close == highestClose)
//@variable Is `true` when the `percentRank` is 0, i.e., when the `close` is the lowest.
bool isLow = percentRank == 0.0

//@variable A multi-line string representing the `time`, `highestClose`, `percentRank`, `barsSinceHigh`, and `isLow`.
string debugString = str.format(
     "time (GMT): {0, time, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss}\nhighestClose: {1, number, #.####}
     \npercentRank: {2, number, #.##}%\nbarsSinceHigh: {3, number, integer}\nisLow: {4}",
     time, highestClose, percentRank, barsSinceHigh, isLow
 )

//@variable Draws a label showing the `debugString` in a tooltip at each bar's `high`.
label debugLabel = label.new(chart.point.now(high), tooltip = debugString)
```

It's important to note that a script can display up to 500
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
drawings, meaning the above examples will only allow users to inspect
the strings from the most recent 500 chart bars.

If a programmer wants to see the results from *earlier* chart bars, one
approach is to create conditional logic that only allows drawings within
a specific time range, e.g.:

```
if time >= startTime and time <= endTime
    <create_drawing_id>
```

If we use this structure in our previous example with
[chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time)
and
[chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time)
as the `startTime` and `endTime` values, the script will only create
[labels](#labels) on
**visible chart bars** and avoid drawing on others. With this logic, we
can scroll to view labels on *any* chart bar, as long as there are up to
`max_labels_count` bars in the visible range:

![image](images/Debugging-Strings-Using-labels-On-successive-bars-3.Dr46dKLS_Z1WAyIK.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Tooltips on visible bars demo", "Inspecting multiple series", true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation window.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 1)

//@variable The highest `close` over `lengthInput` bars.
float highestClose = ta.highest(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The percent rank of the current `close` compared to previous values over `lengthInput` bars.
float percentRank = ta.percentrank(close, lengthInput)
//@variable The number of bars since the `close` was equal to the `highestClose`.
int barsSinceHigh = ta.barssince(close == highestClose)
//@variable Is `true` when the `percentRank` is 0, i.e., when the `close` is the lowest.
bool isLow = percentRank == 0.0

//@variable A multi-line string representing the `time`, `highestClose`, `percentRank`, `barsSinceHigh`, and `isLow`.
string debugString = str.format(
     "time (GMT): {0, time, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss}\nhighestClose: {1, number, #.####}
     \npercentRank: {2, number, #.##}%\nbarsSinceHigh: {3, number, integer}\nisLow: {4}",
     time, highestClose, percentRank, barsSinceHigh, isLow
 )

if time >= chart.left_visible_bar_time and time <= chart.right_visible_bar_time
    //@variable Draws a label showing the `debugString` in a tooltip at each visible bar's `high`.
    label debugLabel = label.new(chart.point.now(high), tooltip = debugString)
```

Note that:

- If the visible chart contains more bars than allowed drawings,
  the script will only show results on the latest bars in the
  visible range. For best results with this technique, zoom on the
  chart to keep the visible range limited to the allowed number of
  drawings.

#### [At the end of the chart](https://www.tradingview.com#at-the-end-of-the-chart)

A frequent approach to debugging a script's strings with
[labels](#labels) is to
display them at the *end* of the chart, namely when the strings do not
change or when only a specific bar's values require analysis.

The script below contains a user-defined `printLabel()` function that
draws a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
at the last available time on the chart, regardless of when the script
calls it. We've used the function in this example to display a "Hello
world!" string, some basic chart information, and the data feed's
current OHLCV values:

![image](images/Debugging-Strings-Using-labels-At-the-end-of-the-chart-1.C-6hYXkR_Z1lpCgi.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Labels at the end of the chart demo", "Chart info", true)

//@function     Draws a label to print the `txt` at the last available time on the chart.
//              When called from the global scope, the label updates its text using the specified `txt` on every bar.
//@param txt    The string to display on the chart.
//@param price  The optional y-axis location of the label. If not specified, draws the label above the last chart bar.
//@returns      The resulting label ID.
printLabel(string txt, float price = na) =>
    int labelTime = math.max(last_bar_time, chart.right_visible_bar_time)
    var label result = label.new(
         labelTime, na, txt, xloc.bar_time, na(price) ? yloc.abovebar : yloc.price, na,
         label.style_none, chart.fg_color, size.large
     )
    label.set_text(result, txt)
    label.set_y(result, price)
    result

//@variable A formatted string containing information about the current chart.
string chartInfo = str.format(
     "Symbol: {0}:{1}\nTimeframe: {2}\nStandard chart: {3}\nReplay active: {4}",
     syminfo.prefix, syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period, chart.is_standard,
     str.contains(syminfo.tickerid, "replay")
 )

//@variable A formatted string containing OHLCV values.
string ohlcvInfo = str.format(
     "O: {0, number, #.#####}, H: {1, number, #.#####}, L: {2, number, #.#####}, C: {3, number, #.#####}, V: {4}",
     open, high, low, close, str.tostring(volume, format.volume)
 )

// Print "Hello world!" and the `chartInfo` at the end of the chart on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    printLabel("Hello world!" + "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n")
    printLabel(chartInfo + "\n\n")

// Print current `ohlcvInfo` at the end of the chart, updating the displayed text as new data comes in.
printLabel(ohlcvInfo)
```

Note that:

- The `printLabel()` function sets the x-coordinate of the drawn
  [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
  using the
  [max](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.max)
  of the
  [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_last_bar_time)
  and the
  [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time)
  to ensure it always shows the results at the last available bar.
- When called from the *global scope*, the function creates a
  [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
  with `text` and `y` properties that update on every bar.
- We've made three calls to the function and added linefeed
  characters (`\n`) to demonstrate that users can superimpose the
  results from multiple
  [labels](#labels) at the end of the chart if the strings have adequate
  line spacing.

### [Using tables](https://www.tradingview.com#using-tables)

[Tables](#tables) display strings
within cells arranged in columns and rows at fixed locations relative to
a chart pane's visual space. They can serve as versatile chart-based
debugging tools, as unlike
[labels](#labels), they
allow programmers to inspect one or *more* "series strings" in an
organized visual structure agnostic to the chart's scale or bar index.

For example, this script calculates a custom `filter` whose result is
the ratio of the
[EMA](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema)
of weighted
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
prices to the
[EMA](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema)
of the `weight` series. For inspection of the variables used in the
calculation, it creates a
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
instance on the first bar, initializes the table's cells on the last
historical bar, then updates necessary cells with "string"
representations of the values from `barsBack` bars ago on the latest
chart bar:

![image](images/Debugging-Strings-Using-tables-1.Bfvract8_Z20ywVF.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Debugging with tables demo", "History inspection", true)

//@variable The number of bars back in the chart's history to inspect.
int barsBack = input.int(10, "Bars back", 0, 4999)

//@variable The percent rank of `volume` over 10 bars.
float weight = ta.percentrank(volume, 10)
//@variable The 10-bar EMA of `weight * close` values.
float numerator = ta.ema(weight * close, 10)
//@variable The 10-bar EMA of `weight` values.
float denominator = ta.ema(weight, 10)
//@variable The ratio of the `numerator` to the `denominator`.
float filter = numerator / denominator

// Plot the `filter`.
plot(filter, "Custom filter")

//@variable The color of the frame, border, and text in the `debugTable`.
color tableColor = chart.fg_color

//@variable A table that contains "string" representations of variable names and values on the latest chart bar.
var table debugTable = table.new(
     position.top_right, 2, 5, frame_color = tableColor, frame_width = 1, border_color = tableColor, border_width = 1
 )

// Initialize cells on the last confirmed historical bar.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    table.cell(debugTable, 0, 0, "Variable", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 1, 0, str.format("Value {0, number, integer} bars ago", barsBack), text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 0, 1, "weight", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 1, 1, "", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 0, 2, "numerator", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 1, 2, "", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 0, 3, "denominator", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 1, 3, "", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 0, 4, "filter", text_color = tableColor)
    table.cell(debugTable, 1, 4, "", text_color = tableColor)

// Update value cells on the last available bar.
if barstate.islast
    table.cell_set_text(debugTable, 1, 1, str.tostring(weight[barsBack], format.percent))
    table.cell_set_text(debugTable, 1, 2, str.tostring(numerator[barsBack]))
    table.cell_set_text(debugTable, 1, 3, str.tostring(denominator[barsBack]))
    table.cell_set_text(debugTable, 1, 4, str.tostring(filter[barsBack]))
```

Note that:

- The script uses the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword to specify that the
  [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
  assigned to the `debugTable` variable on the first bar persists
  throughout the script's execution.
- This script modifies the table within two
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  structures. The first structure initializes the cells with
  [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell)
  only on the last confirmed historical bar
  ([barstate.islastconfirmedhistory](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islastconfirmedhistory)).
  The second structure updates the `text` properties of relevant
  cells with
  [string representations](#representing-other-types) of our variables' values using
  [table.cell_set_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell_set_text)
  calls on the latest available bar
  ([barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast)).

It's important to note that although tables can provide debugging
utility, namely when working with multiple series or creating on-chart
logs, they carry a higher computational cost than other techniques
discussed on this page and may require *more code*. Additionally, unlike
[labels](#using-labels), one can only view a table's state from the latest script
execution. We therefore recommend using them *wisely* and *sparingly*
while debugging, opting for *simplified* approaches where possible. For
more information about using
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
objects, see the [Tables](#tables)
page.

## [Pine Logs](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-logs)

Pine Logs are *interactive messages* that scripts can output at specific
points in their execution. They provide a powerful way for programmers
to inspect a script's data, conditions, and execution flow with minimal
code.

Unlike the other tools discussed on this page, Pine Logs have a
deliberate design for in-depth script debugging. Scripts do not display
Pine Logs on the chart or in the Data Window. Instead, they print
messages with timestamps in the dedicated *Pine Logs pane*, which
provides specialized navigation features and filtering options.

To access the Pine Logs pane, select "Pine Logs…" from the
Editor's "More" menu or from the "More" menu of a script loaded on
the chart that uses `log.*()` functions:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-1.D3YhPfKI_1eBx6z.png)

### [Creating logs](https://www.tradingview.com#creating-logs)

Scripts can create logs by calling the functions in the `log.*()`
namespace.

All `log.*()` functions have the following signatures:

```
log.*(message) → void
log.*(formatString, arg0, arg1, ...) → void
```

The first overload logs a specified `message` in the Pine Logs pane. The
second overload is similar to
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format),
as it logs a formatted message based on the `formatString` and the
additional arguments supplied in the call.

Each `log.*()` function has a different *debug level*, allowing
programmers to categorize and
[filter](#filtering-logs) results shown in the pane:

- The
  [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
  function logs an entry with the *"info"* level that appears in the
  pane with gray text.
- The
  [log.warning()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.warning)
  function logs an entry with the *"warning"* level that appears in
  the pane with orange text.
- The
  [log.error()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.error)
  function logs an entry with the *"error"* level that appears in
  the pane with red text.

This code demonstrates the difference between all three `log.*()`
functions. It calls
[log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info),
[log.warning()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.warning),
and
[log.error()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.error)
on the first available bar:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Creating-logs-1.B6M1BlvN_1OBeQe.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Debug levels demo", overlay = true)

if barstate.isfirst
    log.info("This is an 'info' message.")
    log.warning("This is a 'warning' message.")
    log.error("This is an 'error' message.")
```

Pine Logs can execute anywhere within a script's execution. They allow
programmers to track information from historical bars and monitor how
their scripts behave on realtime, *unconfirmed* bars. When executing on
historical bars, scripts generate a new message once for each `log.*()`
call on a bar. On realtime bars, calls to `log.*()` functions can create
new entries on *each new tick*.

For example, this script calculates the average ratio between each
bar's `close - open` value to its `high - low` range. When the
`denominator` is nonzero, the script calls
[log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
to print the values of the calculation's variables on confirmed bars
and
[log.warning()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.warning)
to print the values on unconfirmed bars. Otherwise, it uses
[log.error()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.error)
to indicate that division by zero occurred, as such cases can affect the
`average` result:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Creating-logs-2.DgOgH4xb_ZRjj9G.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Logging historical and realtime data demo", "Average bar ratio")

//@variable The current bar's change from the `open` to `close`.
float numerator = close - open
//@variable The current bar's `low` to `high` range.
float denominator = high - low
//@variable The ratio of the bar's open-to-close range to its full range.
float ratio = numerator / denominator
//@variable The average `ratio` over 10 non-na values.
float average = ta.sma(ratio, 10)

// Plot the `average`.
plot(average, "average", color.purple, 3)

if barstate.isconfirmed
    // Log a division by zero error if the `denominator` is 0.
    if denominator == 0.0
        log.error("Division by 0 in confirmed results!")
    // Otherwise, log the confirmed values.
    else
        log.info(
             "Values (confirmed):\nnumerator: {1, number, #.########}\ndenominator: {2, number, #.########}
             \nratio: {0, number, #.########}\naverage: {3, number, #.########}",
             ratio, numerator, denominator, average
         )
else
    // Log a division by zero error if the `denominator` is 0.
    if denominator == 0.0
        log.error("Division by 0 on unconfirmed bar.")
    // Otherwise, log the unconfirmed values.
    else
        log.warning(
             "Values (unconfirmed):\nnumerator: {1, number, #.########}\ndenominator: {2, number, #.########}
             \nratio: {0, number, #.########}\naverage: {3, number, #.########}",
             ratio, numerator, denominator, average
         )
```

Note that:

- Pine Logs *do not roll back* on each tick in an unconfirmed bar,
  meaning the results for those ticks show in the pane until the
  script restarts its execution. To only log messages on
  *confirmed* bars, use
  [barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isconfirmed)
  in the conditions that trigger a `log.*()` call.
- When logging on unconfirmed bars, we recommend ensuring those
  logs contain *unique information* or use different *debug
  levels* so you can
  [filter](#filtering-logs) the results as needed.
- The Pine Logs pane will show up to the most recent 10,000
  entries for historical bars. If a script generates more than
  10,000 logs on historical bars and a programmer needs to view
  earlier entries, they can use conditional logic to limit
  `log.*()` calls to specific occurrences. See
  [this](#using-inputs) section for an example that limits log generation to
  a user-specified time range.

### [Inspecting logs](https://www.tradingview.com#inspecting-logs)

Pine Logs include some helpful features that simplify the inspection
process. Whenever a script generates a log, it automatically prefixes
the message with a granular timestamp to signify where the log event
occurred in the time series. Additionally, each entry contains
**"Source code"** and **"Scroll to bar"** icons, which appear when
hovering over it in the Pine Logs pane:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Inspecting-logs-1.CEw5SsHB_27329j.png)

Clicking an entry's "Source code" icon opens the script in the Pine
Editor and highlights the specific line of code that triggered the log:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Inspecting-logs-2.1cfqckmg_1omSJk.png)

Clicking an entry's "Scroll to bar" icon navigates the chart to the
specific bar where the log occurred, then temporarily displays a tooltip
containing time information for that bar:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Inspecting-logs-3.AJrWQdc2_ZHsjQK.png)

Note that:

- The time information in the tooltip depends on the chart's
  timeframe, just like the x-axis label linked to the chart's
  cursor and drawing tools. For example, the tooltip on an EOD
  chart will only show the weekday and the date, whereas the
  tooltip on a 10-second chart will also contain the time of day,
  including seconds.

When a chart includes more than one script that generates logs, it's
important to note that each script maintains its own *independent*
message history. To inspect the messages from a specific script when
multiple are on the chart, select its title from the dropdown at the top
of the Pine Logs pane:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Inspecting-logs-4.CY8OpkgY_Z10JTlu.png)

### [Filtering logs](https://www.tradingview.com#filtering-logs)

A single script can generate numerous logs, depending on the conditions
that trigger its `log.*()` calls. While directly scrolling through the
log history to find specific entries may suffice when a script only
generates a few, it can become unwieldy when searching through hundreds
or thousands of messages.

The Pine Logs pane includes multiple options for filtering messages,
which allows one to simplify their results by isolating specific
*character sequences*, *start times*, and *debug levels*.

Clicking the "Search" icon at the top of the pane opens a search bar,
which matches text to filter logged messages. The search filter also
highlights the matched portion of each message in blue for visual
reference. For example, here, we entered "confirmed" to match all
results generated by our previous script with the word somewhere in
their text:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Filtering-logs-1.Bo6VZioU_Cbru5.png)

Notice that the results from this search also considered messages with
*"unconfirmed"* as matches since the word contains our query. We can
omit these matches by selecting the "Whole Word" checkbox in the
options at the right of the search bar:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Filtering-logs-2.75PYAT31_Z8HPfP.png)

This filter also supports [regular expressions
(regex)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), which allow
users to perform advanced searches that match custom *character
patterns* when selecting the "Regex" checkbox in the search options.
For example, this regex matches all entries that contain "average"
followed by a sequence representing a number greater than 0.5 and less
than or equal to 1:

`average:\s*(0\.[6-9]\d*|0\.5\d*[1-9]\d*|1\.0*)`

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Filtering-logs-3.C8CgIgDR_ZwuDXw.png)

Clicking the "Start date" icon opens a dialog that allows users to
specify the date and time of the first log shown in the results:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Filtering-logs-4.ByHNqBMd_1OJ3LK.png)

After specifying the starting point, a tag containing the starting time
will appear above the log history:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Filtering-logs-5.Dv8F4vq1_1DX0la.png)

Users can filter results by *debug level* using the checkboxes available
when selecting the rightmost icon in the filtering options. Here, we've
deactivated the "info" and "warning" levels so the results will only
contain "error" messages:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Filtering-logs-6.CJM074om_Z1UkF5.png)

#### [Using inputs](https://www.tradingview.com#using-inputs)

Another, more involved way to interactively filter a script's logged
results is to create [inputs](#inputs)
linked to conditional logic that activates specific `log.*()` calls in
the code.

Let's look at an example. This code calculates an
[RMA](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rma)
of
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
prices and declares a few unique conditions to form a
[compound condition](#compound-and-nested-conditions). The script uses
[log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
to display important debugging information in the Pine Logs pane,
including the values of the `compoundCondition` variable and the
"bool" variables that determine its result.

We declared the `filterLogsInput`, `logStartInput`, and `logEndInput`
variables respectively assigned to an
[input.bool()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.bool)
and two
[input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time)
calls for custom log filtering. When `filterLogsInput` is `true`, the
script will only generate a new log if the bar's
[time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time)
is between the `logStartInput` and `logEndInput` values, allowing us to
interactively isolate the entries that occurred within a specific time
range:

![image](images/Debugging-Pine-logs-Filtering-logs-Using-inputs-1.BCr7IdYS_ZmAWLn.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Filtering logs using inputs demo", "Compound condition in input range", true)

//@variable The length for moving average calculations.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 2)

//@variable If `true`, only allows logs within the input time range.
bool filterLogsInput = input.bool(true, "Only log in time range", group = "Log filter")
//@variable The starting time for logs if `filterLogsInput` is `true`.
int logStartInput = input.time(0, "Start time", group = "Log filter", confirm = true)
//@variable The ending time for logs if `filterLogsInput` is `true`.
int logEndInput = input.time(0, "End time", group = "Log filter", confirm = true)

//@variable The RMA of `close` prices.
float rma = ta.rma(close, lengthInput)

//@variable Is `true` when `close` exceeds the `rma`.
bool priceBelow = close <= rma
//@variable Is `true` when the current `close` is greater than the max of the previous `hl2` and `close`.
bool priceRising = close > math.max(hl2[1], close[1])
//@variable Is `true` when the `rma` is positively accelerating.
bool rmaAccelerating = rma - 2.0 * rma[1] + rma[2] > 0.0
//@variable Is `true` when the difference between `rma` and `close` exceeds 2 times the current ATR.
bool closeAtThreshold = rma - close > ta.atr(lengthInput) * 2.0
//@variable Is `true` when all the above conditions occur.
bool compoundCondition = priceBelow and priceRising and rmaAccelerating and closeAtThreshold

// Plot the `rma`.
plot(rma, "RMA", color.teal, 3)
// Highlight the chart background when the `compoundCondition` occurs.
bgcolor(compoundCondition ? color.new(color.aqua, 80) : na, title = "Compound condition highlight")

//@variable If `filterLogsInput` is `true`, is only `true` in the input time range. Otherwise, always `true`.
bool showLog = filterLogsInput ? time >= logStartInput and time <= logEndInput : true

// Log results for a confirmed bar when `showLog` is `true`.
if barstate.isconfirmed and showLog
    log.info(
         "\nclose: {0, number, #.#####}\nrma: {1, number, #.#####}\npriceBelow: {2}\npriceRising: {3}
         \nrmaAccelerating: {4}\ncloseAtThreshold: {5}\n\ncompoundCondition: {6}",
         close, rma, priceBelow, priceRising, rmaAccelerating, closeAtThreshold, compoundCondition
     )
```

Note that:

- The `input.*()` functions assigned to the `filterLogsInput`,
  `logStartInput`, and `logEndInput` variables include a `group`
  argument to oragnize and distinguish them in the script's
  settings.
- The
  [input.time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.time)
  calls include `confirm = true` so that we can interactively set
  the start and end times directly on the chart. To reset the
  inputs, select "Reset points…" from the options in the
  script's "More" menu.
- The condition that triggers each
  [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
  call includes
  [barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isconfirmed)
  to limit log generation to *confirmed* bars.

## [Debugging functions](https://www.tradingview.com#debugging-functions)

[User-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) and
[methods](#user-defined-methods)
are custom functions written by users. They encapsulate sequences of
operations that a script can invoke later in its execution.

Every
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) or
[method](#user-defined-methods)
has a *local scope* that embeds into the script's global scope. The
parameters in a function's signature and the variables declared within
the function body belong to that function's local scope, and they are
*not* directly accessible to a script's outer scope or the scopes of
other functions.

The segments below explain a few ways programmers can debug the values
from a function's local scope. We will use this script as the starting
point for our subsequent examples. It contains a `customMA()` function
that returns an exponential moving average whose smoothing parameter
varies based on the `source` distance outside the 25th and 75th
[percentiles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.percentile_linear_interpolation)
over `length` bars:

![image](images/Debugging-Debugging-functions-1.C82H9E7R_Z1zqdTD.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Debugging functions demo", "Custom MA", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the `customMA()` calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 2)

//@function      Calculates a moving average that only responds to values outside the first and third quartiles.
//@param source  The series of values to process.
//@param length  The number of bars in the calculation.
//@returns       The moving average value.
customMA(float source, int length) =>
    //@variable The custom moving average.
    var float result = na
    // Calculate the 25th and 75th `source` percentiles.
    float q1 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 25)
    float q3 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 75)
    // Calculate the range values.
    float outerRange = math.max(source - q3, q1 - source, 0.0)
    float totalRange = ta.range(source, length)
    //@variable Half the ratio of the `outerRange` to the `totalRange`.
    float alpha = 0.5 * outerRange / totalRange
    // Mix the `source` with the `result` based on the `alpha` value.
    result := (1.0 - alpha) * nz(result, source) + alpha * source
    // Return the `result`.
    result

//@variable The `customMA()` result over `lengthInput` bars.
float maValue = customMA(close, lengthInput)

// Plot the `maValue`.
plot(maValue, "Custom MA", color.blue, 3)
```

### [Extracting local variables](https://www.tradingview.com#extracting-local-variables)

When a programmer wants to inspect a
[user-defined function's](#user-defined-functions) local variables by
[plotting](#plotting-numbers) its values,
[coloring](#conditional-colors) the background or chart bars, etc., they must *extract* the
values to the *global scope*, as the built-in functions that produce
such outputs can only accept global variables and literals.

Since the values returned by a function are available to the scope where
a call occurs, one straightforward extraction approach is to have the
function return a [tuple](#tuples) containing all the values that need inspection.

Here, we've modified the `customMA()` function to return a
[tuple](#tuples) containing
all the function's calculated variables. Now, we can call the function
with a *tuple declaration* to make the values available in the global
scope and inspect them with
[plots](#plotting-numbers):

![image](images/Debugging-Debugging-functions-Extracting-local-variables-1.Crv6Jvx8_Z2qevgh.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Extracting local variables with tuples demo", "Custom MA", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the `customMA()` calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 2)

//@function      Calculates a moving average that only responds to values outside the first and third quartiles.
//@param source  The series of values to process.
//@param length  The number of bars in the calculation.
//@returns       The moving average value.
customMA(float source, int length) =>
    //@variable The custom moving average.
    var float result = na
    // Calculate the 25th and 75th `source` percentiles.
    float q1 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 25)
    float q3 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 75)
    // Calculate the range values.
    float outerRange = math.max(source - q3, q1 - source, 0.0)
    float totalRange = ta.range(source, length)
    //@variable Half the ratio of the `outerRange` to the `totalRange`.
    float alpha = 0.5 * outerRange / totalRange
    // Mix the `source` with the `result` based on the `alpha` value.
    result := (1.0 - alpha) * nz(result, source) + alpha * source
    // Return a tuple containing the `result` and other local variables.
    [result, q1, q3, outerRange, totalRange, alpha]

// Declare a tuple containing all values returned by `customMA()`.
[maValue, q1Debug, q3Debug, outerRangeDebug, totalRangeDebug, alphaDebug] = customMA(close, lengthInput)

// Plot the `maValue`.
plot(maValue, "Custom MA", color.blue, 3)

//@variable Display location for plots with different scale.
notOnPane = display.all - display.pane

// Display the extracted `q1` and `q3` values in all plot locations.
plot(q1Debug, "q1", color.new(color.maroon, 50))
plot(q3Debug, "q3", color.new(color.teal, 50))
// Display the other extracted values in the status line and Data Window to avoid impacting the scale.
plot(outerRangeDebug, "outerRange", chart.fg_color, display = notOnPane)
plot(totalRangeDebug, "totalRange", chart.fg_color, display = notOnPane)
plot(alphaDebug, "alpha", chart.fg_color, display = notOnPane)
// Highlight the chart when `alphaDebug` is 0, i.e., when the `maValue` does not change.
bgcolor(alphaDebug == 0.0 ? color.new(color.orange, 90) : na, title = "`alpha == 0.0` highlight")
```

Note that:

- We used `display.all - display.pane` for the plots of the
  `outerRangeDebug`, `totalRangeDebug`, and `alphaDebug` variables
  to
  [avoid impacting the chart's scale](#without-affecting-the-scale).
- The script also uses a
  [conditional color](#conditional-colors) to highlight the chart pane's
  [background](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
  when `debugAlpha` is 0, indicating the `maValue` does not
  change.

Another, more *advanced* way to extract the values of a function's
local variables is to pass them to a *reference type* variable declared
in the global scope.

Function scopes can access global variables for their calculations.
While a script cannot directly reassign the values of global variables
from within a function's scope, it can update the *elements or
properties* of those values if they are reference types, such as
[arrays](#arrays),
[matrices](#matrices),
[maps](#maps), and
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types).

This version declares a `debugData` variable in the global scope that
references a
[map](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_map)
with "string" keys and "float" values. Within the local scope of the
`customMA()` function, the script puts *key-value pairs* containing each
local variable's name and value into the map. After calling the
function, the script plots the stored `debugData` values:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Extracting local variables with reference types demo", "Custom MA", true)

//@variable The number of bars in the `customMA()` calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 2)

//@variable A map with "string" keys and "float" values for debugging the `customMA()`.
map<string, float> debugData = map.new<string, float>()

//@function      Calculates a moving average that only responds to values outside the first and third quartiles.
//@param source  The series of values to process.
//@param length  The number of bars in the calculation.
//@returns       The moving average value.
customMA(float source, int length) =>
    //@variable The custom moving average.
    var float result = na
    // Calculate the 25th and 75th `source` percentiles.
    float q1 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 25),    map.put(debugData, "q1", q1)
    float q3 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 75),    map.put(debugData, "q3", q3)
    // Calculate the range values.
    float outerRange = math.max(source - q3, q1 - source, 0.0),           map.put(debugData, "outerRange", outerRange)
    float totalRange = ta.range(source, length),                          map.put(debugData, "totalRange", totalRange)
    //@variable Half the ratio of the `outerRange` to the `totalRange`.
    float alpha = 0.5 * outerRange / totalRange,                          map.put(debugData, "alpha", alpha)
    // Mix the `source` with the `result` based on the `alpha` value.
    result := (1.0 - alpha) * nz(result, source) + alpha * source
    // Return the `result`.
    result

//@variable The `customMA()` result over `lengthInput` bars.
float maValue = customMA(close, lengthInput)

// Plot the `maValue`.
plot(maValue, "Custom MA", color.blue, 3)

//@variable Display location for plots with different scale.
notOnPane = display.all - display.pane

// Display the extracted `q1` and `q3` values in all plot locations.
plot(map.get(debugData, "q1"), "q1", color.new(color.maroon, 50))
plot(map.get(debugData, "q3"), "q3", color.new(color.teal, 50))
// Display the other extracted values in the status line and Data Window to avoid impacting the scale.
plot(map.get(debugData, "outerRange"), "outerRange", chart.fg_color, display = notOnPane)
plot(map.get(debugData, "totalRange"), "totalRange", chart.fg_color, display = notOnPane)
plot(map.get(debugData, "alpha"), "alpha", chart.fg_color, display = notOnPane)
// Highlight the chart when the extracted `alpha` is 0, i.e., when the `maValue` does not change.
bgcolor(map.get(debugData, "alpha") == 0.0 ? color.new(color.orange, 90) : na, title = "`alpha == 0.0` highlight")
```

Note that:

- We placed each
  [map.put()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.put)
  call on the same line as each variable declaration, separated by
  a comma, to keep things concise and avoid adding extra lines to
  the `customMA()` code.
- We used
  [map.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_map.get)
  to retrieve each value for the debug
  [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
  and
  [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
  calls.

### [Local drawings and logs](https://www.tradingview.com#local-drawings-and-logs)

Unlike `plot.*()` functions and others that require values accessible to
the global scope, scripts can generate
[drawing objects](#drawing-types) and [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) from directly within a function, allowing programmers to
flexibly debug its local variables *without* extracting values to the
outer scope.

In this example, we used
[labels](#labels) and
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs) to
display
[string representations](#representing-other-types) of the values within the `customMA()` scope. Inside the
function, the script calls
[str.format()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.format)
to create a formatted string representing the local scope's data, then
calls
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new)
and
[log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
to respectively display the text on the chart in a tooltip and log an
"info" message containing the text in the
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane:

![image](images/Debugging-Debugging-functions-Local-drawings-and-logs-1.iGi0vyrx_2s4zkG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Local drawings and logs demo", "Custom MA", true, max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the `customMA()` calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 2)

//@function      Calculates a moving average that only responds to values outside the first and third quartiles.
//@param source  The series of values to process.
//@param length  The number of bars in the calculation.
//@returns       The moving average value.
customMA(float source, int length) =>
    //@variable The custom moving average.
    var float result = na
    // Calculate the 25th and 75th `source` percentiles.
    float q1 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 25)
    float q3 = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(source, length, 75)
    // Calculate the range values.
    float outerRange = math.max(source - q3, q1 - source, 0.0)
    float totalRange = ta.range(source, length)
    //@variable Half the ratio of the `outerRange` to the `totalRange`.
    float alpha = 0.5 * outerRange / totalRange
    // Mix the `source` with the `result` based on the `alpha` value.
    result := (1.0 - alpha) * nz(result, source) + alpha * source

    //@variable A formatted string containing representations of all local variables.
    string debugText = str.format(
         "\n`customMA()` data\n----------\nsource: {0, number, #.########}\nlength: {1}\nq1: {2, number, #.########}
         \nq3: {3, number, #.########}\nouterRange: {4, number, #.########}\ntotalRange: {5, number, #.########}
         \nalpha{6, number, #.########}\nresult: {7, number, #.########}",
         source, length, q1, q3, outerRange, totalRange, alpha, result
     )
    // Draw a label with a tooltip displaying the `debugText`.
    label.new(bar_index, high, color = color.new(chart.fg_color, 80), tooltip = debugText)
    // Print an "info" message in the Pine Logs pane when the bar is confirmed.
    if barstate.isconfirmed
        log.info(debugText)

    // Return the `result`.
    result

//@variable The `customMA()` result over `lengthInput` bars.
float maValue = customMA(close, lengthInput)

// Plot the `maValue`.
plot(maValue, "Custom MA", color.blue, 3)
```

Note that:

- We included `max_labels_count = 500` in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function to display
  [labels](#labels) for the most recent 500 `customMA()` calls.
- The function uses
  [barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isconfirmed)
  in an
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  statement to only call
  [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
  on *confirmed* bars. It does not log a new message on each
  realtime tick.

## [Debugging loops](https://www.tradingview.com#debugging-loops)

[Loops](#loops) are structures that
repeatedly execute a code block based on a *counter*
([for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)),
the contents of a
[collection](#collections)
([for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)),
or a *condition*
([while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while)).
They allow scripts to perform repetitive tasks without the need for
redundant lines of code.

Each loop instance maintains a separate local scope, which all outer
scopes cannot access. All variables declared within a loop's scope are
specific to that loop, meaning one cannot use them in an outer scope.

As with other structures in Pine, there are numerous possible ways to
debug loops. This section explores a few helpful techniques, including
extracting local values for [plots](#plots), inspecting values with
[drawings](#drawing-types), and tracing a loop's execution with
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs).

We will use this script as a starting point for the examples in the
following segments. It aggregates the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
value's rates of change over 1 - `lookbackInput` bars and accumulates
them in a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)
loop, then divides the result by the `lookbackInput` to calculate a
final average value:

![image](images/Debugging-Debugging-loops-1.Co481TKA_ZQmJYP.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Debugging loops demo", "Aggregate ROC")

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lookbackInput = input.int(20, "Lookback", 1)

//@variable The average ROC of `close` prices over each length from 1 to `lookbackInput` bars.
float aroc = 0.0

// Calculation loop.
for length = 1 to lookbackInput
    //@variable The `close` value `length` bars ago.
    float pastClose = close[length]
    //@variable The `close` rate of change over `length` bars.
    float roc = (close - pastClose) / pastClose
    // Add the `roc` to `aroc`.
    aroc += roc

// Divide `aroc` by the `lookbackInput`.
aroc /= lookbackInput

// Plot the `aroc`.
plot(aroc, "aroc", color.blue, 3)
```

Note that:

- The `aroc` is a *global* variable modified within the loop,
  whereas `pastClose` and `roc` are *local* variables inaccessible
  to the outer scope.

### [Inspecting a single iteration](https://www.tradingview.com#inspecting-a-single-iteration)

When a programmer needs to focus on a specific loop iteration, there are
multiple techniques they can use, most of which entail using a
*condition* inside the loop to trigger debugging actions, such as
extracting values to outer variables, creating
[drawings](#drawing-types), [logging](#pine-logs) messages, etc.

This example inspects the local `roc` value from a single iteration of
the loop in three different ways. When the loop counter's value equals
the `debugCounterInput`, the script assigns the `roc` to an `rocDebug`
variable from the global scope for
[plotting](#plotting-numbers), draws a vertical
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line)
from 0 to the `roc` value using
[line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.new),
and logs a message in the
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane
using
[log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info):

![image](images/Debugging-Debugging-loops-Inspecting-a-single-iteration-1.tCjAEA7s_1OlVrm.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Inspecting a single iteration demo", "Aggregate ROC", max_lines_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lookbackInput = input.int(20, "Lookback", 1)
//@variable The `length` value in the loop's execution where value extraction occurs.
int debugCounterInput = input.int(1, "Loop counter value", 1, group = "Debugging")

//@variable The `roc` value extracted from the loop.
float rocDebug = na

//@variable The average ROC of `close` over lags from 1 to `lookbackInput` bars.
float aroc = 0.0

// Calculation loop.
for length = 1 to lookbackInput
    //@variable The `close` value `length` bars ago.
    float pastClose = close[length]
    //@variable The `close` rate of change over `length` bars.
    float roc = (close - pastClose) / pastClose
    // Add the `roc` to `aroc`.
    aroc += roc

    // Trigger debug actions when the `length` equals the `debugCounterInput`.
    if length == debugCounterInput
        // Assign `roc` to `rocDebug` so the script can plot its value.
        rocDebug := roc
        // Draw a vertical line from 0 to the `roc` at the `bar_index`.
        line.new(bar_index, 0.0, bar_index, roc, color = color.new(color.gray, 50), width = 4)
        // Log an "info" message in the Pine Logs pane.
        log.info("{0}-bar `roc`{1}: {2, number, #.########}", length, barstate.isconfirmed ? " (confirmed)" : "", roc)

// Divide `aroc` by the `lookbackInput`.
aroc /= lookbackInput

// Plot the `aroc`.
plot(aroc, "aroc", color.blue, 3)

// Plot the `rocDebug`.
plot(rocDebug, "Extracted roc", color.new(color.rgb(206, 55, 136), 40), 2)
```

Note that:

- The
  [input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)
  call assigned to the `debugCounterInput` includes a `group`
  argument to distinguish it in the script's settings.
- The
  [log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
  call includes "(confirmed)" in the formatted message whenever
  [barstate.isconfirmed](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isconfirmed)
  is `true`. Searching this text in the
  [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane will filter out the entries from unconfirmed
  bars. See the
  [Filtering logs](#filtering-logs) section above.

### [Inspecting multiple iterations](https://www.tradingview.com#inspecting-multiple-iterations)

When inspecting the values from several loop iterations, it's often
helpful to utilize
[collections](#collections) or strings to gather the results for use in output functions
after the loop terminates.

This version demonstrates a few ways to collect and display the loop's
values from all iterations. It declares a `logText` string and a
`debugValues` array in the global scope. Inside the local scope of the
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)
loop, the script *concatenates* a
[string representation](#representing-other-types) of the `length` and `roc` with the `logText` and calls
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
to push the iteration's `roc` value into the `debugValues` array.

After the loop ends, the script
[plots](#plotting-numbers) the
[first](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.first)
and
[last](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.last)
value from the `debugValues` array, draws a
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
with a *tooltip* showing a
[string representation](#representing-other-types) of the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
and displays the `logText` in the
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane
upon the bar's confirmation:

![image](images/Debugging-Debugging-loops-Inspecting-multiple-iterations-1.CYLBy0Wy_ZVV2R6.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Inspecting multiple iterations demo", "Aggregate ROC", max_labels_count = 500)

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lookbackInput = input.int(20, "Lookback", 1)

//@variable An array containing the `roc` value from each loop iteration.
array<float> debugValues = array.new<float>()
//@variable A "string" containing information about the `roc` on each iteration.
string logText = ""

//@variable The average ROC of `close` over lags from 1 to `lookbackInput` bars.
float aroc = 0.0

// Calculation loop.
for length = 1 to lookbackInput
    //@variable The `close` value `length` bars ago.
    float pastClose = close[length]
    //@variable The `close` rate of change over `length` bars.
    float roc = (close - pastClose) / pastClose
    // Add the `roc` to `aroc`.
    aroc += roc

    // Concatenate a new "string" representation with the `debugText`.
    logText += "\nlength: " + str.tostring(length) + ", roc: " + str.tostring(roc)
    // Push the `roc` value into the `debugValues` array.
    array.push(debugValues, roc)

// Divide `aroc` by the `lookbackInput`.
aroc /= lookbackInput

// Plot the `aroc`.
plot(aroc, "aroc", color.blue, 3)

// Plot the `roc` values from the first and last iteration.
plot(array.first(debugValues), "First iteration roc", color.new(color.rgb(166, 84, 233), 50), 2)
plot(array.last(debugValues), "Last iteration roc", color.new(color.rgb(115, 86, 218), 50), 2)
// Draw a label with a tooltip containing a "string" representation of the `debugValues` array.
label.new(bar_index, aroc, color = color.new(color.rgb(206, 55, 136), 70), tooltip = str.tostring(debugValues))
// Log the `logText` in the Pine Logs pane when the bar is confirmed.
if barstate.isconfirmed
    log.info(logText)
```

Another way to inspect a loop over several iterations is to generate
sequential [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) or create/modify
[drawing objects](#drawing-types) within the loop's scope to trace its execution pattern with
granular detail.

This example uses [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) to trace the execution flow of our script's loop. It
generates a new "info" message on each iteration to track the local
scope's calculations as the loop progresses on each confirmed bar:

![image](images/Debugging-Debugging-loops-Inspecting-multiple-iterations-2.CahjoXFr_Z1z4bNL.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Inspecting multiple iterations demo", "Aggregate ROC")

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lookbackInput = input.int(20, "Lookback", 1)

//@variable The average ROC of `close` over lags from 1 to `lookbackInput` bars.
float aroc = 0.0

// Calculation loop.
for length = 1 to lookbackInput
    //@variable The `close` value `length` bars ago.
    float pastClose = close[length]
    //@variable The `close` rate of change over `length` bars.
    float roc = (close - pastClose) / pastClose
    // Add the `roc` to `aroc`.
    aroc += roc
    if barstate.isconfirmed
        log.info(
             "{0}\nlength (counter): {1}\npastClose: {2, number, #.#####}\n
             distance to pastClose: {3, number, #.########}\nroc: {4, number, #.########}\n
             aroc (before division): {5, number, #.########}\n{6}",
             length == 1 ? "LOOP START" : "",
             length, pastClose, close - pastClose, roc, aroc,
             length == lookbackInput ? "LOOP END" : ""
         )

// Divide `aroc` by the `lookbackInput`.
aroc /= lookbackInput

// Plot the `aroc`.
plot(aroc, "aroc", color.blue, 3)
```

Note that:

- When iteratively generating
  [logs](#pine-logs) or
  drawings from inside a loop, make it a point to avoid
  unnecessary clutter and strive for easy navigation. More is not
  always better for debugging, especially when working within
  loops.

## [Tips](https://www.tradingview.com#tips)

### [Organization and readability](https://www.tradingview.com#organization-and-readability)

When writing scripts, it's wise to prioritize organized, readable
source codes. Code that's organized and easy to read helps streamline
the debugging process. Additionally, well-written code is easier to
maintain over time.

Here are a few quick tips based on our
[Style guide](#style-guide) and the
examples on this page:

- Aim to follow the general
  [script organization](#script-organization) recommendations. Organizing scripts using this structure
  makes things easier to locate and inspect.
- Choose variable and function names that make them easy to *identify*
  and *understand*. See the
  [Naming conventions](#naming-conventions) section for some examples.
- It's often helpful to temporarily assign important parts of
  expressions to variables with informative names while debugging.
  Breaking expressions down into reusable parts helps simplify
  inspection processes.
- Use *comments* and *annotations* (`//@function`, `//@variable`,
  etc.) to document your code. Annotations are particularly helpful,
  as the Pine Editor's autosuggest displays variable and function
  descriptions in a pop-up when hovering over their identifiers
  anywhere in the code.
- Remember that *less is more* in many cases. Don't overwhelm
  yourself with excessive script outputs or unnecessary information
  while debugging. Keep things simple, and only include as much
  information as you need.

### [Speeding up repetitive tasks](https://www.tradingview.com#speeding-up-repetitive-tasks)

There are a few handy techniques we often utilize when debugging our
code:

- We use
  [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
  or
  [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
  to quickly display the results of "int", "float", or "bool"
  variables and expressions in the script's status line and the Data
  Window.
- We often use
  [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
  to visualize the history of certain
  [conditions](#conditions) on the chart.
- We use a one-line version of our `printLabel()` function from
  [this section](#at-the-end-of-the-chart) to print strings at the end of the chart.
- We use a
  [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new)
  call with a `tooltip` argument to display strings in tooltips
  [on successive bars](#on-successive-bars).
- We use the `log.*()` functions to quickly display data with
  [string representations](#representing-other-types) in the
  [Pine Logs](#pine-logs)
  pane.

When one establishes their typical debugging processes, it's often
helpful to create *keyboard macros* to speed up repetitive tasks and
spend less time setting up debug outputs in each code.

The following is a simple *AutoHotkey* script (**not** Pine Script™
code) that includes hotstrings for the above five techniques. The script
generates code snippets by entering a specified character sequence
followed by a whitespace:

```
; ————— This is AHK code, not Pine Script™. —————
; Specify that hotstrings trigger when they end with space, tab, linefeed, or carriage return.#Hotstring EndChars `t `n `r
:X:,,show::SendInput, plotchar(%Clipboard%, "%Clipboard%", "", color = chart.fg_color, display = display.all - display.pane){Enter}:X:,,highlight::SendInput, bgcolor(bool(%Clipboard%) ? color.new(color.orange, 80) : na, title = "%Clipboard% highlight"){Enter}:X:,,print::SendInput, printLabel(string txt, float price = na) => int labelTime = math.max(last_bar_time, chart.right_visible_bar_time), var label result = label.new(labelTime, na, txt, xloc.bar_time, na(price) ? yloc.abovebar : yloc.price, na, label.style_none, chart.fg_color, size.large), label.set_text(result, txt), label.set_y(result, price), result`nprintLabel(){Left}:X:,,tooltip::SendInput, label.new(bar_index, high, color = color.new(chart.fg_color, 70), tooltip = str.tostring(%Clipboard%)){Enter}:X:,,log::SendInput, log.info(str.tostring(%Clipboard%)){Enter}
```

The ",,show" macro generates a
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
call that uses the clipboard's contents for the `series` and `title`
arguments. Copying a `variableName` variable or the `close > open`
expression and typing ",,show" followed by a space will respectively
yield:

```
plotchar(variableName, "variableName", "", color = chart.fg_color, display = display.all - display.pane)
plotchar(close > open, "close > open", "", color = chart.fg_color, display = display.all - display.pane)
```

The ",,highlight" macro generates a
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
call that highlights the chart pane's background with a
[conditional color](#conditional-colors) based on the variable or expression copied to the clipboard.
For example, copying the
[barstate.isrealtime](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isrealtime)
variable and typing ",,highlight" followed by a space will yield:

```
bgcolor(bool(barstate.isrealtime) ? color.new(color.orange, 80) : na, title = "barstate.isrealtime highlight")
```

The ",,print" macro generates the one-line `printLabel()` function and
creates an empty `printLabel()` call with the cursor placed inside it.
All you need to do after typing ",,print" followed by a space is enter
the text you want to display:

```
printLabel(string txt, float price = na) => int labelTime = math.max(last_bar_time, chart.right_visible_bar_time), var label result = label.new(labelTime, na, txt, xloc.bar_time, na(price) ? yloc.abovebar : yloc.price, na, label.style_none, chart.fg_color, size.large), label.set_text(result, txt), label.set_y(result, price), result
printLabel()
```

The ",,tooltip" macro generates a
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new)
call with a `tooltip` argument that uses
[str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
on the clipboard's contents. Copying the `variableName` variable and
typing ",,tooltip" followed by a space yields:

```
label.new(bar_index, high, color = color.new(chart.fg_color, 70), tooltip = str.tostring(variableName))
```

The ",,log" macro generates a
[log.info()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info)
call with a `message` argument that uses
[str.tostring()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.tostring)
on the clipboard's contents to display string representations of
variables and expressions in the
[Pine Logs](#pine-logs) pane.
Copying the expression `bar_index % 2 == 0` and typing ",,log"
followed by a space yields:

```
log.info(str.tostring(bar_index % 2 == 0))
```

Note that:

- AHK is available for *Windows* devices. Research other software
  to employ a similar process if your machine uses a different
  operating system.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Writing scripts](#style-guide)/Profiling and optimization

# [Profiling and optimization](https://www.tradingview.com#profiling-and-optimization)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script™ is a cloud-based compiled language geared toward efficient
repeated script execution. When a user adds a Pine script to a chart, it
executes *numerous* times, once for each available bar or tick in the
data feeds it accesses, as explained in this manual's
[Execution model](#execution-model)
page.

The Pine Script™ compiler automatically performs several internal
optimizations to accommodate scripts of various sizes and help them run
smoothly. However, such optimizations *do not* prevent performance
bottlenecks in script executions. As such, it's up to programmers to
[profile](#pine-profiler) a script's runtime performance and identify ways to modify
critical code blocks and lines when they need to improve execution
times.

This page covers how to profile and monitor a script's runtime and
executions with the
[Pine Profiler](#pine-profiler) and explains some ways programmers can modify their code to
[optimize](#optimization) runtime performance.

For a quick introduction, see the following video, where we profile an example script and optimize it step-by-step, examining several common script inefficiencies and explaining how to avoid them along the way:

[](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7sbzWL0Dk)## [Pine Profiler](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-profiler)

Before diving into
[optimization](#optimization), it's prudent to evaluate a script's runtime and pinpoint
*bottlenecks*, i.e., areas in the code that substantially impact overall
performance. With these insights, programmers can ensure they focus on
optimizing where it truly matters instead of spending time and effort on
low-impact code.

Enter the *Pine Profiler*, a powerful utility that analyzes the
executions of all significant code lines and blocks in a script and
displays helpful performance information next to the lines inside the
Pine Editor. By inspecting the Profiler's results, programmers can gain
a clearer perspective on a script's overall runtime, the distribution
of runtime across its significant code regions, and the critical
portions that may need extra attention and optimization.

### [Profiling a script](https://www.tradingview.com#profiling-a-script)

The Pine Profiler can analyze the runtime performance of any *editable*
script coded in Pine Script™ v6. To profile a script, add it to the
chart, open the source code in the Pine Editor, and select "Enable
profiler mode" from the dropdown next to the "Add to chart/Update on
chart" option in the top-right corner:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Profiling-a-script-1.Bm1SQAOz_ZcitjV.png)

We will use the script below for our initial profiling example, which
calculates a custom `oscillator` based on average distances from the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price to upper and lower
[percentiles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.percentile_linear_interpolation)
over `lengthInput` bars. It includes a few different types of
*significant* code regions, which come with some differences in
[interpretation](#interpreting-profiled-results) while profiling:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Pine Profiler demo")

//@variable The number of bars in the calculations.
int lengthInput = input.int(100, "Length", 2)
//@variable The percentage for upper percentile calculation.
float upperPercentInput = input.float(75.0, "Upper percentile", 50.0, 100.0)
//@variable The percentage for lower percentile calculation.
float lowerPercentInput = input.float(25.0, "Lower percentile", 0.0, 50.0)

// Calculate percentiles using the linear interpolation method.
float upperPercentile = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(close, lengthInput, upperPercentInput)
float lowerPercentile = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(close, lengthInput, lowerPercentInput)

// Declare arrays for upper and lower deviations from the percentiles on the same line.
var upperDistances = array.new<float>(lengthInput), var lowerDistances = array.new<float>(lengthInput)

// Queue distance values through the `upperDistances` and `lowerDistances` arrays based on excessive price deviations.
if math.abs(close - 0.5 * (upperPercentile + lowerPercentile)) > 0.5 * (upperPercentile - lowerPercentile)
    array.push(upperDistances, math.max(close - upperPercentile, 0.0))
    array.shift(upperDistances)
    array.push(lowerDistances, math.max(lowerPercentile - close, 0.0))
    array.shift(lowerDistances)

//@variable The average distance from the `upperDistances` array.
float upperAvg = upperDistances.avg()
//@variable The average distance from the `lowerDistances` array.
float lowerAvg = lowerDistances.avg()
//@variable The ratio of the difference between the `upperAvg` and `lowerAvg` to their sum.
float oscillator = (upperAvg - lowerAvg) / (upperAvg + lowerAvg)
//@variable The color of the plot. A green-based gradient if `oscillator` is positive, a red-based gradient otherwise.
color oscColor = oscillator > 0 ?
     color.from_gradient(oscillator, 0.0, 1.0, color.gray, color.green) :
     color.from_gradient(oscillator, -1.0, 0.0, color.red, color.gray)

// Plot the `oscillator` with the `oscColor`.
plot(oscillator, "Oscillator", oscColor, style = plot.style_area)
```

Once enabled, the Profiler collects information from all executions of
the script's significant code lines and blocks, then displays bars and
approximate runtime percentages to the left of the code lines inside the
Pine Editor:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Profiling-a-script-2.Ud_wxirg_1toi2O.png)

Note that:

- The Profiler tracks every execution of a significant code
  region, including the executions on *realtime ticks*. Its
  information updates over time as new executions occur.
- Profiler results **do not** appear for script declaration
  statements, type declarations, other *insignificant* code lines
  such as variable declarations with no tangible impact, *unused
  code* that the script's outputs do not depend on, or
  *repetitive code* that the compiler optimizes during
  translation. See
  [this section](#insignificant-unused-and-redundant-code) for more information.

When a script contains at least *four* significant lines of code, the
Profiler will include "flame" icons next to the *top three* code
regions with the highest performance impact. If one or more of the
highest-impact code regions are *outside* the lines visible inside the
Pine Editor, a "flame" icon and a number indicating how many critical
lines are outside the view will appear at the top or bottom of the left
margin. Clicking the icon will vertically scroll the Editor's window to
show the nearest critical line:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Profiling-a-script-3.CRdP8jVv_Z2lC0Am.png)

Hovering the mouse pointer over the space next to a line highlights the
analyzed code and exposes a tooltip with additional information,
including the time spent and the number of executions. The information
shown next to each line and in the corresponding tooltip depends on the
profiled code region. The
[section below](#interpreting-profiled-results) explains different types of code the Profiler analyzes and
how to interpret their performance results.

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Profiling-a-script-4.B8hBGa6N_2sbc0.png)

### [Interpreting profiled results](https://www.tradingview.com#interpreting-profiled-results)

#### [Single-line results](https://www.tradingview.com#single-line-results)

For a code line containing single-line expressions, the Profiler bar and
displayed percentage represent the relative portion of the script's
total runtime spent on that line. The corresponding tooltip displays
three fields:

- The "Line number" field indicates the analyzed code line.
- The "Time" field shows the runtime percentage for the line of
  code, the runtime spent on that line, and the script's total
  runtime.
- The "Executions" field shows the number of times that specific
  line executed while running the script.

Here, we hovered the pointer over the space next to line 12 of our
profiled code to view its tooltip:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Single-line-results-1.DxmafMJF_Z1xuVkr.png)

```
float upperPercentile = ta.percentile_linear_interpolation(close, lengthInput, upperPercentInput)
```

Note that:

- The time information for the line represents the time spent
  completing *all* executions, **not** the time spent on a single
  execution.
- To estimate the *average* time spent per execution, divide the
  line's time by the number of executions. In this case, the
  tooltip shows that line 12 took about 14.1 milliseconds to
  execute 20,685 times, meaning the average time per execution was
  approximately 14.1 ms / 20685 = 0.0006816534 milliseconds
  (0.6816534 microseconds).

When a line of code consists of more than one expression separated by
commas, the number of executions shown in the tooltip represents the
*sum* of each expression's total executions, and the time value
displayed represents the total time spent evaluating all the line's
expressions.

For instance, this global line from our initial example includes two
[variable declarations](#variable-declarations) separated by commas. Each uses the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword, meaning the script only executes them once on the first
available bar. As we see in the Profiler tooltip for the line, it
counted *two* executions (one for each expression), and the time value
shown is the *combined* result from both expressions on the line:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Single-line-results-2.CGsjIphG_1lBWSK.png)

```
var upperDistances = array.new<float>(lengthInput), var lowerDistances = array.new<float>(lengthInput)
```

Note that:

- When analyzing scripts with more than one expression on the same
  line, we recommend moving each expression to a *separate line*
  for more detailed insights while profiling, namely if they may
  contain *higher-impact* calculations.

When using
[line wrapping](#line-wrapping) for readability or stylistic purposes, the Profiler
considers all portions of a wrapped line as part of the *first line*
where it starts in the Pine Editor.

For example, although this code from our initial script occupies more
than one line in the Pine Editor, it's still treated as a *single* line
of code, and the Profiler tooltip displays single-line results, with the
"Line number" field showing the *first* line in the Editor that the
wrapped line occupies:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Single-line-results-3.8u0gLHs0_yR0hQ.png)

```
color oscColor = oscillator > 0 ?
     color.from_gradient(oscillator, 0.0, 1.0, color.gray, color.green) :
     color.from_gradient(oscillator, -1.0, 0.0, color.red, color.gray)
```

#### [Code block results](https://www.tradingview.com#code-block-results)

For a line at the start of a [loop](#loops) or
[conditional structure](#conditional-structures), the Profiler bar and percentage represent the relative
portion of the script's runtime spent on the **entire code block**, not
just the single line. The corresponding tooltip displays four fields:

- The "Code block range" field indicates the range of lines included
  in the structure.
- The "Time" field shows the code block's runtime percentage, the
  time spent on all block executions, and the script's total runtime.
- The "Line time" field shows the runtime percentage for the
  block's initial line, the time spent on that line, and the
  script's total runtime. The interpretation differs for
  [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
  blocks or
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  blocks *with*[else
  if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  statements, as the values represent the total time spent on **all**
  the structure's conditional statements. See below for more
  information.
- The "Executions" field shows the number of times the code block
  executed while running the script.

Here, we hovered over the space next to line 19 in our initial script,
the beginning of a simple
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure *without*[else
if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
statements. As we see below, the tooltip shows performance information
for the entire code block and the current line:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Code-block-results-1.Cp7Cs5Lf_Z1aX7Bw.png)

```
if math.abs(close - 0.5 * (upperPercentile + lowerPercentile)) > 0.5 * (upperPercentile - lowerPercentile)
    array.push(upperDistances, math.max(close - upperPercentile, 0.0))
    array.shift(upperDistances)
    array.push(lowerDistances, math.max(lowerPercentile - close, 0.0))
    array.shift(lowerDistances)
```

Note that:

- The "Time" field shows that the total time spent evaluating
  the structure 20,685 times was 7.2 milliseconds.
- The "Line time" field indicates that the runtime spent on the
  *first line* of this
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  structure was about three milliseconds.

Users can also inspect the results from lines and nested blocks within a
code block's range to gain more granular performance insights. Here, we
hovered over the space next to line 20 within the code block to view its
[single-line result](#single-line-results):

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Code-block-results-2.Cy1_m4AY_ZsCh1h.png)

Note that:

- The number of executions shown is *less than* the result for the
  entire code block, as the condition that controls the execution
  of this line does not return `true` all the time. The opposite
  applies to the code inside [loops](#loops) since each execution of a loop statement can trigger
  **several** executions of the loop's local block.

When profiling a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure or an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure that includes [else
if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
statements, the "Line time" field will show the time spent executing
**all** the structure's conditional expressions, **not** just the
block's first line. The results for the lines inside the code block
range will show runtime and executions for each **local block**. This
format is necessary for these structures due to the Profiler's
calculation and display constraints. See
[this section](#a-look-into-the-profilers-inner-workings) for more information.

For example, the "Line time" for the
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure in this script represents the time spent evaluating *all four*
conditional statements within its body, as the Profiler *cannot* track
them separately. The results for each line in the code block's range
represent the performance information for each *local block*:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`switch` and `if...else if` results demo")

//@variable The upper band for oscillator calculation.
var float upperBand = close
//@variable The lower band for oscillator calculation.
var float lowerBand = close

// Update the `upperBand` and `lowerBand` based on the proximity of the `close` to the current band values.
// The "Line time" field on line 11 represents the time spent on all 4 conditional expressions in the structure.
switch
    close > upperBand                     => upperBand := close
    close < lowerBand                     => lowerBand := close
    upperBand - close > close - lowerBand => upperBand := 0.9 * upperBand + 0.1 * close
    close - lowerBand > upperBand - close => lowerBand := 0.9 * lowerBand + 0.1 * close

//@variable The ratio of the difference between `close` and `lowerBand` to the band range.
float oscillator = 100.0 * (close - lowerBand) / (upperBand - lowerBand)

// Plot the `oscillator` as columns with a dynamic color.
plot(
     oscillator, "Oscillator", oscillator > 50.0 ? color.teal : color.maroon,
     style = plot.style_columns, histbase = 50.0
 )
```

When the conditional logic in such structures involves significant
calculations, programmers may require more granular performance
information for each calculated condition. An effective way to achieve
this analysis is to use *nested*[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) blocks
instead of the more compact
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
or [if…else
if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structures. For example, instead of:

```
switch
    <expression1> => <localBlock1>
    <expression2> => <localBlock2>
    =>               <localBlock3>
```

or:

```
if <expression1>
    <localBlock1>
else if <expression2>
    <localBlock2>
else
    <localBlock3>
```

one can use nested
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) blocks
for more in-depth profiling while maintaining the same logical flow:

```
if <expression1>
    <localBlock1>
else
    if <expression2>
        <localBlock2>
    else
        <localBlock3>
```

Below, we changed the previous
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
example to an equivalent nested
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure. Now, we can view the runtime and executions for each
significant part of the conditional pattern individually:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Code-block-results-4.OxkZ6XRw_Zs1azS.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`switch` and `if...else if` results demo")

//@variable The upper band for oscillator calculation.
var float upperBand = close
//@variable The lower band for oscillator calculation.
var float lowerBand = close

// Update the `upperBand` and `lowerBand` based on the proximity of the `close` to the current band values.
if close > upperBand
    upperBand := close
else
    if close < lowerBand
        lowerBand := close
    else
        if upperBand - close > close - lowerBand
            upperBand := 0.9 * upperBand + 0.1 * close
        else
            if close - lowerBand > upperBand - close
                lowerBand := 0.9 * lowerBand + 0.1 * close

//@variable The ratio of the difference between `close` and `lowerBand` to the band range.
float oscillator = 100.0 * (close - lowerBand) / (upperBand - lowerBand)

// Plot the `oscillator` as columns with a dynamic color.
plot(
     oscillator, "Oscillator", oscillator > 50.0 ? color.teal : color.maroon,
     style = plot.style_columns, histbase = 50.0
 )
```

Note that:

- This same process can also apply to [ternary
  expressions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_?:).
  When a complex ternary expression's operands contain
  significant calculations, reorganizing the logic into a nested
  [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
  structure allows more detailed Profiler results, making it
  easier to spot critical parts.

#### [User-defined function calls](https://www.tradingview.com#user-defined-function-calls)

[User-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) and
[methods](#user-defined-methods)
are functions written by users. They encapsulate code sequences that a
script may execute several times. Users often write functions and
methods for improved code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

The indented lines of code within a function represent its *local
scope*, i.e., the sequence that executes *each time* the script calls
it. Unlike code in a script's global scope, which a script evaluates
once on each execution, the code inside a function may activate zero,
one, or *multiple times* on each script execution, depending on the
conditions that trigger the calls, the number of calls that occur, and
the function's logic.

This distinction is crucial to consider while interpreting Profiler
results. When a profiled code contains
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) or
[method](#user-defined-methods)
calls:

- The results for each *function call* reflect the runtime allocated
  toward it and the total number of times the script activated that
  specific call.
- The time and execution information for all local code *inside* a
  function's scope reflects the combined results from **all** calls
  to the function.

This example contains a user-defined `similarity()` function that
estimates the similarity of two series, which the script calls only
*once* from the global scope on each execution. In this case, the
Profiler's results for the code inside the function's body correspond
to that specific call:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-User-defined-function-calls-1.DUf4uWCa_1zRHzX.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("User-defined function calls demo")

//@function Estimates the similarity between two standardized series over `length` bars.
//          Each individual call to this function activates its local scope.
similarity(float sourceA, float sourceB, int length) =>
    // Standardize `sourceA` and `sourceB` for comparison.
    float normA = (sourceA - ta.sma(sourceA, length)) / ta.stdev(sourceA, length)
    float normB = (sourceB - ta.sma(sourceB, length)) / ta.stdev(sourceB, length)
    // Calculate and return the estimated similarity of `normA` and `normB`.
    float abSum = math.sum(normA * normB, length)
    float a2Sum = math.sum(normA * normA, length)
    float b2Sum = math.sum(normB * normB, length)
    abSum / math.sqrt(a2Sum * b2Sum)

// Plot the similarity between the `close` and an offset `close` series.
plot(similarity(close, close[1], 100), "Similarity 1", color.red)
```

Let's increase the number of times the script calls the function each
time it executes. Here, we changed the script to call our
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions)*five times*:

```
//@version=6
indicator("User-defined function calls demo")

//@function Estimates the similarity between two standardized series over `length` bars.
//          Each individual call to this function activates its local scope.
similarity(float sourceA, float sourceB, int length) =>
    // Standardize `sourceA` and `sourceB` for comparison.
    float normA = (sourceA - ta.sma(sourceA, length)) / ta.stdev(sourceA, length)
    float normB = (sourceB - ta.sma(sourceB, length)) / ta.stdev(sourceB, length)
    // Calculate and return the estimated similarity of `normA` and `normB`.
    float abSum = math.sum(normA * normB, length)
    float a2Sum = math.sum(normA * normA, length)
    float b2Sum = math.sum(normB * normB, length)
    abSum / math.sqrt(a2Sum * b2Sum)

// Plot the similarity between the `close` and several offset `close` series.
plot(similarity(close, close[1], 100), "Similarity 1", color.red)
plot(similarity(close, close[2], 100), "Similarity 2", color.orange)
plot(similarity(close, close[4], 100), "Similarity 3", color.green)
plot(similarity(close, close[8], 100), "Similarity 4", color.blue)
plot(similarity(close, close[16], 100), "Similarity 5", color.purple)
```

In this case, the local code results no longer correspond to a *single*
evaluation per script execution. Instead, they represent the *combined*
runtime and executions of the local code from **all five** calls. As we
see below, the results after running this version of the script across
the same data show 137,905 executions of the local code, *five times*
the number from when the script only contained one `similarity()`
function call:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-User-defined-function-calls-2.BJPTeot1_Z1mNfz1.png)

#### [When requesting other contexts](https://www.tradingview.com#when-requesting-other-contexts)

Pine scripts can request data from other *contexts*, i.e., different
symbols, timeframes, or data modifications than what the chart's data
uses by calling the `request.*()` family of functions or specifying an
alternate `timeframe` in the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
declaration statement.

When a script requests data from another context, it evaluates all
required scopes and calculations within that context, as explained in
the
[Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page. This behavior can affect the runtime of a script's
code regions and the number of times they execute.

The Profiler information for any code
[line](#single-line-results) or
[block](#code-block-results) represents the results from executing the code in *all
necessary contexts*, which may or may not include the chart's data.
Pine Script™ determines which contexts to execute code within based on
the calculations required by a script's data requests and outputs.

Let's look at a simple example. This initial script only uses the
chart's data for its calculations. It declares a `pricesArray` variable
with the
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keyword, meaning the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
assigned to it persists across the data's history and all available
realtime ticks. On each execution, the script calls
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
to push a new
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
value into the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
and it [plots](#plots) the [array's
size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size).

After profiling the script across all the bars on an intraday chart, we
see that the number of elements in the `pricesArray` corresponds to the
number of executions the Profiler shows for the
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
call on line 8:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-When-requesting-other-contexts-1.4ixtln-7_gTemj.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("When requesting other contexts demo")

//@variable An array containing the `close` value from every available price update.
varip array<float> pricesArray = array.new<float>()

// Push a new `close` value into the `pricesArray` on each update.
array.push(pricesArray, close)

// Plot the size of the `pricesArray`.
plot(array.size(pricesArray), "Total number of chart price updates")
```

Now, let's try evaluating the size of the `pricesArray` from *another
context* instead of using the chart's data. Below, we've added a
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call with
[array.size(pricesArray)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
as its `expression` argument to retrieve the value calculated on the
"1D" timeframe and plotted that result instead.

In this case, the number of executions the Profiler shows on line 8
still corresponds to the number of elements in the `pricesArray`.
However, it did not execute the same number of times since the script
did not require the *chart's data* in the calculations. It only needed
to initialize the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
and evaluate
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
across all the requested *daily data*, which has a different number of
price updates than our current intraday chart:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-When-requesting-other-contexts-2.COS2z1lh_s4Tg3.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("When requesting other contexts demo")

//@variable An array containing the `close` value from every available price update.
varip array<float> pricesArray = array.new<float>()

// Push a new `close` value into the `pricesArray` on each update.
array.push(pricesArray, close)

// Plot the size of the `pricesArray` requested from the daily timeframe.
plot(request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", array.size(pricesArray)), "Total number of daily price updates")
```

Note that:

- The requested EOD data in this example had fewer data points
  than our intraday chart, so the
  [array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
  call required fewer executions in this case. However, EOD feeds
  *do not* have history limitations, meaning it's also possible
  for requested HTF data to span **more** bars than a user's
  chart, depending on the timeframe, the data provider, and the
  user's [plan](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/).

If this script were to plot the
[array.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size)
value directly in addition to the requested daily value, it would then
require the creation of *two*[arrays](#arrays) (one for each context) and the execution of
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
across both the chart's data *and* the data from the daily timeframe.
As such, the declaration on line 5 will execute *twice*, and the results
on line 8 will reflect the time and executions accumulated from
evaluating the
[array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push)
call across **both separate datasets**:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-When-requesting-other-contexts-3.CPXHEchh_1SVGGO.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("When requesting other contexts demo")

//@variable An array containing the `close` value from every available price update.
varip array<float> pricesArray = array.new<float>()

// Push a new `close` value into the `pricesArray` on each update.
array.push(pricesArray, close)

// Plot the size of the `pricesArray` from the daily timeframe and the chart's context.
// Including both in the outputs requires executing line 5 and line 8 across BOTH datasets.  
plot(request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", array.size(pricesArray)), "Total number of daily price updates")
plot(array.size(pricesArray), "Total number of chart price updates")
```

It's important to note that when a script calls a
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) or
[method](#user-defined-methods)
that contains `request.*()` calls in its local scope, the script's
*translated form* extracts the `request.*()` calls **outside** the scope
and encapsulates the expressions they depend on within **separate
functions**. When the script executes, it evaluates the required
`request.*()` calls first, then *passes* the requested data to a
*modified form* of the
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions).

Since the translated script executes a
[user-defined function's](#user-defined-functions) data requests separately **before** evaluating non-requested
calculations in its local scope, the Profiler's results for lines
containing calls to the function **will not** include the time spent on
its `request.*()` calls or their required expressions.

As an example, the following script contains a user-defined
`getCompositeAvg()` function with a
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call that requests the
[math.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.avg)
of 10
[ta.wma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.wma)
calls with different `length` arguments from a specified `symbol`. The
script uses the function to request the average result using a [Heikin
Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ticker.heikinashi)
ticker ID:

```
//@version=6
indicator("User-defined functions with `request.*()` calls demo", overlay = true)

int multInput = input.int(10, "Length multiplier", 1)

string tickerID = ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid)

getCompositeAvg(string symbol, int lengthMult) =>
    request.security(
         symbol, timeframe.period, math.avg(
             ta.wma(close, lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 2 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 3 * lengthMult), 
             ta.wma(close, 4 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 5 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 6 * lengthMult),
             ta.wma(close, 7 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 8 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 9 * lengthMult), 
             ta.wma(close, 10 * lengthMult)
         )
     )

plot(getCompositeAvg(tickerID, multInput), "Composite average", linewidth = 3)
```

After profiling the script, users might be surprised to see that the
runtime results shown inside the function's body heavily **exceed** the
results shown for the *single*`getCompositeAvg()` call:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-When-requesting-other-contexts-4.CkN5cmYP_xCyjm.png)

The results appear this way since the translated script includes
internal modifications that *moved* the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call and its expression **outside** the function's scope, and the
Profiler has no way to represent the results from those calculations
other than displaying them next to the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
line in this scenario. The code below roughly illustrates how the
translated script looks:

```
//@version=6
indicator("User-defined functions with `request.*()` calls demo", overlay = true)

int multInput = input.int(10, "Length multiplier")

string tickerID = ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid)

secExpr(int lengthMult)=>
    math.avg(
         ta.wma(close, lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 2 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 3 * lengthMult),
         ta.wma(close, 4 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 5 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 6 * lengthMult),
         ta.wma(close, 7 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 8 * lengthMult), ta.wma(close, 9 * lengthMult),
         ta.wma(close, 10 * lengthMult)
     )

float sec = request.security(tickerID, timeframe.period, secExpr(multInput))

getCompositeAvg(float s) =>
    s

plot(getCompositeAvg(sec), "Composite average", linewidth = 3)
```

Note that:

- The `secExpr()` code represents the *separate function* used by
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  to calculate the required expression in the requested context.
- The
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call takes place in the **outer scope**, outside the
  `getCompositeAvg()` function.
- The translation substantially reduced the local code of
  `getCompositeAvg()`. It now solely returns a value passed into
  it, as all the function's required calculations take place
  **outside** its scope. Due to this reduction, the function
  call's performance results **will not** reflect any of the time
  spent on the data request's required calculations.

#### [Insignificant, unused, and redundant code](https://www.tradingview.com#insignificant-unused-and-redundant-code)

When inspecting a profiled script's results, it's crucial to
understand that *not all* code in a script necessarily impacts runtime
performance. Some code has no direct performance impact, such as a
script's declaration statement and
[type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_type)
declarations. Other code regions with insignificant expressions, such as
most `input.*()` calls, variable references, or
[variable declarations](#variable-declarations) without significant calculations, have little to *no effect*
on a script's runtime. Therefore, the Profiler will **not** display
performance results for these types of code.

Additionally, Pine scripts do not execute code regions that their
*outputs* ([plots](#plots),
[drawings](#drawing-types),
[logs](#pine-logs), etc.) do
not depend on, as the compiler automatically **removes** them during
translation. Since unused code regions have *zero* impact on a script's
performance, the Profiler will **not** display any results for them.

The following example contains a `barsInRange` variable and a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
that adds 1 to the variable's value for each historical
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price between the current
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high)
and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low)
over `lengthInput` bars. However, the script **does not use** these
calculations in its outputs, as it only
[plots](#plots) the
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price. Consequently, the script's compiled form **discards** that
unused code and only considers the
[plot(close)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
call.

The Profiler does not display **any** results for this script since it
does not execute any **significant** calculations:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Insignificant-unused-and-redundant-code-1.CVzX40Kz_HGwJR.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Unused code demo")

//@variable The number of historical bars in the calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(100, "Length", 1)

//@variable The number of closes over `lengthInput` bars between the current bar's `high` and `low`.
int barsInRange = 0

for i = 1 to lengthInput
    //@variable The `close` price from `i` bars ago.
    float pastClose = close[i]
    // Add 1 to `barsInRange` if the `pastClose` is between the current bar's `high` and `low`.
    if pastClose > low and pastClose < high
        barsInRange += 1

// Plot the `close` price. This is the only output. 
// Since the outputs do not require any of the above calculations, the compiled script will not execute them.
plot(close)
```

Note that:

- Although this script does not use the
  [input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)
  from line 5 and discards all its associated calculations, the
  "Length" input *will* still appear in the script's settings,
  as the compiler **does not** completely remove unused
  [inputs](#inputs).

If we change the script to plot the `barsInRange` value instead, the
declared variables and the
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
are no longer unused since the output depends on them, and the Profiler
will now display performance information for that code:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Insignificant-unused-and-redundant-code-2.TBOBJdXS_Z1yftUf.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Unused code demo")

//@variable The number of historical bars in the calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(100, "Length", 1)

//@variable The number of closes over `lengthInput` bars between the current bar's `high` and `low`.
int barsInRange = 0

for i = 1 to lengthInput
    //@variable The `close` price from `i` bars ago.
    float pastClose = close[i]
    // Add 1 to `barsInRange` if the `pastClose` is between the current bar's `high` and `low`.
    if pastClose > low and pastClose < high
        barsInRange += 1

// Plot the `barsInRange` value. The above calculations will execute since the output requires them.
plot(barsInRange, "Bars in range")
```

Note that:

- The Profiler does not show performance information for the
  `lengthInput` declaration on line 5 or the `barsInRange`
  declaration on line 8 since the expressions on these lines do
  not impact the script's performance.

When possible, the compiler also simplifies certain instances of
*redundant code* in a script, such as some forms of identical
expressions with the same
[fundamental type](#types)
values. This optimization allows the compiled script to only execute
such calculations *once*, on the first occurrence, and *reuse* the
calculated result for each repeated instance that the outputs depend on.

If a script contains repetitive code and the compiler simplifies it, the
Profiler will only show results for the **first occurrence** of the code
since that's the only time the script requires the calculation.

For example, this script contains a code line that plots the value of
[ta.sma(close,
100)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
and 12 code lines that plot the value of [ta.sma(close,
500)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma):

```
//@version=6
indicator("Redundant calculations demo", overlay = true)

// Plot the 100-bar SMA of `close` values one time.
plot(ta.sma(close, 100), "100-bar SMA", color.teal, 3)

// Plot the 500-bar SMA of `close` values 12 times. After compiler optimizations, only the first `ta.sma(close, 500)`
// call on line 9 requires calculation in this case.
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #001aff, 12)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #4d0bff, 11)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #7306f7, 10)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #920be9, 9)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #ae11d5, 8)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #c618be, 7)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #db20a4, 6)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #eb2c8a, 5)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #f73d6f, 4)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #fe5053, 3)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #ff6534, 2)
plot(ta.sma(close, 500), "500-bar SMA", #ff7a00, 1)
```

Since the last 12 lines all contain identical
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
calls, the compiler can automatically simplify the script so that it
only needs to evaluate [ta.sma(close,
500)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)*once* per execution rather than repeating the calculation 11 more
times.

As we see below, the Profiler only shows results for lines 5 and 9.
These are the only parts of the code requiring significant calculations
since the
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)
calls on lines 10-20 are redundant in this case:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Interpreting-profiled-results-Insignificant-unused-and-redundant-code-3.B3yrx82E_2jeci8.png)

Another type of repetitive code optimization occurs when a script
contains two or more
[user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) or
[methods](#user-defined-methods)
with identical compiled forms. In such a case, the compiler simplifies
the script by **removing** the redundant functions, and the script will
treat all calls to the redundant functions as calls to the **first**
defined version. Therefore, the Profiler will only show local code
performance results for the *first* function since the discarded
"clones" will never execute.

For instance, the script below contains two
[user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions), `metallicRatio()` and `calcMetallic()`, that calculate a
[metallic ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_mean) of a given
order raised to a specified exponent:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Redundant functions demo")

//@variable Controls the base ratio for the `calcMetallic()` call.
int order1Input = input.int(1, "Order 1", 1)
//@variable Controls the base ratio for the `metallicRatio()` call.
int order2Input = input.int(2, "Order 2", 1)

//@function       Calculates the value of a metallic ratio with a given `order`, raised to a specified `exponent`.
//@param order    Determines the base ratio used. 1 = Golden Ratio, 2 = Silver Ratio, 3 = Bronze Ratio, and so on.
//@param exponent The exponent applied to the ratio.
metallicRatio(int order, float exponent) =>
    math.pow((order + math.sqrt(4.0 + order * order)) * 0.5, exponent)

//@function       A function with the same signature and body as `metallicRatio()`.
//                The script discards this function and treats `calcMetallic()` as an alias for `metallicRatio()`.
calcMetallic(int ord, float exp) =>
    math.pow((ord + math.sqrt(4.0 + ord * ord)) * 0.5, exp)

// Plot the results from a `calcMetallic()` and `metallicRatio()` call.
plot(calcMetallic(order1Input, bar_index % 5), "Ratio 1", color.orange, 3)
plot(metallicRatio(order2Input, bar_index % 5), "Ratio 2", color.maroon)
```

Despite the differences in the function and parameter names, the two
functions are otherwise identical, which the compiler detects while
translating the script. In this case, it **discards** the redundant
`calcMetallic()` function, and the compiled script treats the
`calcMetallic()` call as a `metallicRatio()` call.

As we see here, the Profiler shows performance information for the
`calcMetallic()` and `metallicRatio()` calls on lines 21 and 22, but it
does **not** show any results for the local code of the `calcMetallic()`
function on line 18. Instead, the Profiler's information on line 13
within the `metallicRatio()` function reflects the local code results
from **both**[function calls](#user-defined-function-calls):

### [A look into the Profiler's inner workings](https://www.tradingview.com#a-look-into-the-profilers-inner-workings)

The Pine Profiler wraps all necessary code regions with specialized
*internal functions* to track and collect required information across
script executions. It then passes the information to additional
calculations that organize and display the performance results inside
the Pine Editor. This section gives users a peek into how the Profiler
applies internal functions to wrap Pine code and collect performance
data.

There are two main internal **(non-Pine)** functions the Profiler wraps
significant code with to facilitate runtime analysis. The first function
retrieves the current system time at specific points in the script's
execution, and the second maps cumulative elapsed time and execution
data to specific code regions. We represent these functions in this
explanation as `System.timeNow()` and `registerPerf()` respectively.

When the Profiler detects code that requires analysis, it adds
`System.timeNow()` above the code to get the initial time before
execution. Then, it adds `registerPerf()` below the code to map and
accumulate the elapsed time and number of executions. The elapsed time
added on each `registerPerf()` call is the `System.timeNow()` value
*after* the execution minus the value *before* the execution.

The following *pseudocode* outlines this process for a
[single line](#single-line-results) of code, where `_startX` represents the starting time for
the `lineX` line:

```
long _startX = System.timeNow()
<code_line_to_analyze>
registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _startX, lineX)
```

The process is similar for
[code blocks](#code-block-results). The difference is that the `registerPerf()` call maps the
data to a *range of lines* rather than a single line. Here, `lineX`
represents the *first* line in the code block, and `lineY` represents
the block's *last* line:

```
long _startX = System.timeNow()
<code_block_to_analyze>
registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _startX, lineX, lineY)
```

Note that:

- In the above snippets, `long`, `System.timeNow()`, and
  `registerPerf()` represent *internal code*, **not** Pine Script™
  code.

Let's now look at how the Profiler wraps a full script and all its
significant code. We will start with this script, which calculates three
pseudorandom series and displays their
[average](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.avg)
result. The script utilizes an [object](#objects) of a
[user-defined type](#user-defined-types) to store a pseudorandom state, a
[method](#user-defined-methods)
to calculate new values and update the state, and an [if…else
if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure to update each series based on generated values:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Profiler's inner workings demo")

int seedInput = input.int(12345, "Seed")

type LCG
    float state

method generate(LCG this, int generations = 1) =>
    float result = 0.0
    for i = 1 to generations
        this.state := 16807 * this.state % 2147483647
        result += this.state / 2147483647
    result / generations

var lcg = LCG.new(seedInput)

var float val0 = 1.0
var float val1 = 1.0
var float val2 = 1.0

if lcg.generate(10) < 0.5
    val0 *= 1.0 + (2.0 * lcg.generate(50) - 1.0) * 0.1
else if lcg.generate(10) < 0.5
    val1 *= 1.0 + (2.0 * lcg.generate(50) - 1.0) * 0.1
else if lcg.generate(10) < 0.5
    val2 *= 1.0 + (2.0 * lcg.generate(50) - 1.0) * 0.1

plot(math.avg(val0, val1, val2), "Average pseudorandom result", color.purple)
```

The Profiler will wrap the entire script and all necessary code regions,
excluding any
[insignificant, unused, or redundant code](#insignificant-unused-and-redundant-code), with the aforementioned **internal** functions to collect
performance data. The *pseudocode* below demonstrates how this process
applies to the above script:

```
long _startMain = System.timeNow() // Start time for the script's overall execution.

// <Additional internal code executes here>

//@version=6
indicator("Profiler's inner workings demo") // Declaration statements do not require profiling.

int seedInput = input.int(12345, "Seed") // Variable declaration without significant calculation.

type LCG        // Type declarations do not require profiling.
    float state

method generate(LCG this, int generations = 1) => // Function signature does not affect runtime.
    float result = 0.0 // Variable declaration without significant calculation.

    long _start11 = System.timeNow() // Start time for the loop block that begins on line 11.
    for i = 1 to generations // Loop header calculations are not independently wrapped.

        long _start12 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 12.
        this.state := 16807 * this.state % 2147483647
        registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start12, line12) // Register performance info for line 12.

        long _start13 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 13.
        result += this.state / 2147483647
        registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start13, line13) // Register performance info for line 13.

    registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start11, line11, line13) // Register performance info for the block (line 11 - 13).    

    long _start14 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 14.
    result / generations
    registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start14, line14) // Register performance info for line 14.

long _start16 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 16.
var lcg = LCG.new(seedInput)
registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start16, line16) // Register performance info for line 16.

var float val0 = 1.0 // Variable declarations without significant calculations.
var float val1 = 1.0
var float val2 = 1.0

long _start22 = System.timeNow() // Start time for the `if` block that begins on line 22.
if lcg.generate(10) < 0.5 // `if` statement is not independently wrapped.

    long _start23 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 23.
    val0 *= 1.0 + (2.0 * lcg.generate(50) - 1.0) * 0.1
    registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start23, line23) // Register performance info for line 23.

else if lcg.generate(10) < 0.5 // `else if` statement is not independently wrapped.

    long _start25 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 25.
    val1 *= 1.0 + (2.0 * lcg.generate(50) - 1.0) * 0.1
    registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start25, line25) // Register performance info for line 25.

else if lcg.generate(10) < 0.5 // `else if` statement is not independently wrapped.

    long _start27 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 27.
    val2 *= 1.0 + (2.0 * lcg.generate(50) - 1.0) * 0.1
    registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start27, line27) // Register performance info for line 27.

registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start22, line22, line28) // Register performance info for the block (line 22 - 28).

long _start29 = System.timeNow() // Start time for line 29.
plot(math.avg(val0, val1, val2), "Average pseudorandom result", color.purple)
registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _start29, line29) // Register performance info for line 29.

// <Additional internal code executes here>

registerPerf(System.timeNow() - _startMain, total) // Register the script's overall performance info.
```

Note that:

- This example is **pseudocode** that provides a basic outline of
  the **internal calculations** the Profiler applies to collect
  performance data. Saving this example in the Pine Editor will
  result in a compilation error since `long`, `System.timeNow()`,
  and `registerPerf()`**do not** represent Pine Script™ code.
- These internal calculations that the Profiler wraps a script
  with require **additional** computational resources, which is
  why a script's runtime **increases** while profiling.
  Programmers should always interpret the results as **estimates**
  since they reflect a script's performance with the extra
  calculations included.

After running the wrapped script to collect performance data,
*additional* internal calculations organize the results and display
relevant information inside the Pine Editor:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-A-look-into-the-profilers-inner-workings-1.wt5GoYky_Z1cXiWC.png)

The *"Line time"* calculation for
[code blocks](#code-block-results) also occurs at this stage, as the Profiler cannot
individually wrap [loop](#loops)
headers or the conditional statements in
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) or
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structures. This field's value represents the *difference* between a
block's total time and the sum of its local code times, which is why
the "Line time" value for a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
block or an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) block
with [else
if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
expressions represents the time spent on **all** the structure's
conditional statements, not just the block's *initial line* of code. If
a programmer requires more granular information for each conditional
expression in such a block, they can reorganize the logic into a
*nested*[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure, as explained
[here](#code-block-results).

### [Profiling across configurations](https://www.tradingview.com#profiling-across-configurations)

When a code's [time
complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) is not
constant or its execution pattern varies with its inputs, function
arguments, or available data, it's often wise to profile the code
across *different configurations* and data feeds for a more well-rounded
perspective on its general performance.

For example, this simple script uses a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
to calculate the sum of squared distances between the current
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price and `lengthInput` previous prices, then plots the [square
root](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sqrt)
of that sum on each bar. In this case, the `lengthInput` directly
impacts the calculation's runtime since it determines the number of
times the loop executes its local code:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Profiling across configurations demo")

//@variable The number of previous bars in the calculation. Directly affects the number of loop iterations.
int lengthInput = input.int(25, "Length", 1)

//@variable The sum of squared distances from the current `close` to `lengthInput` past `close` values.
float total = 0.0

// Look back across `lengthInput` bars and accumulate squared distances.
for i = 1 to lengthInput
    float distance = close - close[i]
    total += distance * distance

// Plot the square root of the `total`.
plot(math.sqrt(total))
```

Let's try profiling this script with different `lengthInput` values.
First, we'll use the default value of 25. The Profiler's results for
this specific run show that the script completed 20,685 executions in
about 96.7 milliseconds:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Profiling-across-configurations-1.DH6uvleV_15wBst.png)

Here, we've increased the input's value to 50 in the script's
settings. The results for this run show that the script's total runtime
was 194.3 milliseconds, close to *twice* the time from the previous run:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Profiling-across-configurations-2.ggfGlT9L_ZW6q7G.png)

In the next run, we changed the input's value to 200. This time, the
Profiler's results show that the script finished all executions in
approximately 0.8 seconds, around *four times* the previous run's time:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Profiling-across-configurations-3.CZLkQfeW_Z1lXDjU.png)

We can see from these observations that the script's runtime appears to
scale *linearly* with the `lengthInput` value, excluding other factors
that may affect performance, as one might expect since the bulk of the
script's calculations occur within the loop and the input's value
controls how many times the loop must execute.

### [Repetitive profiling](https://www.tradingview.com#repetitive-profiling)

The runtime resources available to a script *vary* over time.
Consequently, the time it takes to evaluate a code region, even one with
constant [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity),
*fluctuates* across executions, and the cumulative performance results
shown by the Profiler **will vary** with each independent script run.

Users can enhance their analysis by *restarting* a script several times
and profiling each independent run. Averaging the results from each
profiled run and evaluating the dispersion of runtime results can help
users establish more robust performance benchmarks and reduce the impact
of *outliers* (abnormally long or short runtimes) in their conclusions.

Incorporating a *dummy input* (i.e., an input that does nothing) into a
script's code is a simple technique that enables users to *restart* it
while profiling. The input will not directly affect any calculations or
outputs. However, as the user changes its value in the script's
settings, the script restarts and the Profiler re-analyzes the executed
code.

For example, this script
[queues](#using-an-array-as-a-queue) pseudorandom values with a constant seed through an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
with a fixed size, and it calculates and plots the array's
[average](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg)
value on each bar. For profiling purposes, the script includes a
`dummyInput` variable with an
[input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.int)
value assigned to it. The input does nothing in the code aside from
allowing us to *restart* the script each time we change its value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Repetitive profiling demo")

//@variable An input not connected to script calculations. Changing its value in the "Inputs" tab restarts the script.
int dummyInput = input.int(0, "Dummy input")

//@variable An array of pseudorandom values.
var array<float> randValues = array.new<float>(2500, 0.0)

// Push a new `math.random()` value with a fixed `seed` into the `randValues` array and remove the oldest value.
array.push(randValues, math.random(seed = 12345))
array.shift(randValues)

// Plot the average of all elements in the `randValues` array.
plot(array.avg(randValues), "Pseudorandom average")
```

After the first script run, the Profiler shows that it took 308.6
milliseconds to execute across all of the chart's data:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Repetitive-profiling-1.CfionGK2_pmOYe.png)

Now, let's change the dummy input's value in the script's settings to
restart it without changing the calculations. This time, it completed
the same code executions in 424.6 milliseconds, 116 milliseconds longer
than the previous run:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Repetitive-profiling-2.LouNiZpq_o9WWS.png)

Restarting the script again yields another new result. On the third run,
the script finished all code executions in 227.4 milliseconds, the
shortest time so far:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Pine-profiler-Repetitive-profiling-3.UGJOj4nF_Z1p4czi.png)

After repeating this process several times and documenting the results
from each run, one can manually calculate their *average* to estimate
the script's expected total runtime:

`AverageTime = (time1 + time2 + ... + timeN) / N`

## [Optimization](https://www.tradingview.com#optimization)

*Code optimization*, not to be confused with indicator or strategy
optimization, involves modifying a script's source code for improved
execution time, resource efficiency, and scalability. Programmers may
use various approaches to optimize a script when they need enhanced
runtime performance, depending on what a script's calculations entail.

Fundamentally, most techniques one will use to optimize Pine code
involve *reducing* the number of times critical calculations occur or
*replacing* significant calculations with simplified formulas or
built-ins. Both of these paradigms often overlap.

The following sections explain several straightforward concepts
programmers can apply to optimize their Pine Script™ code.

### [Using built-ins](https://www.tradingview.com#using-built-ins)

Pine Script™ features a variety of *built-in* functions and variables
that help streamline script creation. Many of Pine's built-ins feature
internal optimizations to help maximize efficiency and minimize
execution time. As such, one of the simplest ways to optimize Pine code
is to utilize these efficient built-ins in a script's calculations when
possible.

Let's look at an example where one can replace user-defined
calculations with a concise built-in call to substantially improve
performance. Suppose a programmer wants to calculate the highest value
of a series over a specified number of bars. Someone not familiar with
all of Pine's built-ins might approach the task using a code like the
following, which uses a [loop](#loops)
on each bar to compare `length` historical values of a `source` series:

```
//@variable A user-defined function to calculate the highest `source` value over `length` bars.
pineHighest(float source, int length) =>
    float result = na
    if bar_index + 1 >= length
        result := source
        if length > 1
            for i = 1 to length - 1
                result := math.max(result, source[i])
    result
```

Alternatively, one might devise a more optimized Pine function by
reducing the number of times the loop executes, as iterating over the
history of the `source` to achieve the result is only necessary when
specific conditions occur:

```
//@variable A faster user-defined function to calculate the highest `source` value over `length` bars.
//          This version only requires a loop when the highest value is removed from the window, the `length` 
//          changes, or when the number of bars first becomes sufficient to calculate the result. 
fasterPineHighest(float source, int length) =>
    var float result = na
    if source[length] == result or length != length[1] or bar_index + 1 == length
        result := source
        if length > 1
            for i = 1 to length - 1
                result := math.max(result, source[i])
    else
        result := math.max(result, source)
    result
```

The built-in
[ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
function will outperform **both** of these implementations, as its
internal calculations are highly optimized for efficient execution.
Below, we created a script that plots the results of calling
`pineHighest()`, `fasterPineHighest()`, and
[ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
to compare their performance using the
[Profiler](#pine-profiler):

```
//@version=6 
indicator("Using built-ins demo")

//@variable A user-defined function to calculate the highest `source` value over `length` bars.
pineHighest(float source, int length) =>
    float result = na
    if bar_index + 1 >= length
        result := source
        if length > 1
            for i = 1 to length - 1
                result := math.max(result, source[i])
    result

//@variable A faster user-defined function to calculate the highest `source` value over `length` bars.
//          This version only requires a loop when the highest value is removed from the window, the `length` 
//          changes, or when the number of bars first becomes sufficient to calculate the result. 
fasterPineHighest(float source, int length) =>
    var float result = na
    if source[length] == result or length != length[1] or bar_index + 1 == length
        result := source
        if length > 1
            for i = 1 to length - 1
                result := math.max(result, source[i])
    else
        result := math.max(result, source)
    result

plot(pineHighest(close, 20))
plot(fasterPineHighest(close, 20))
plot(ta.highest(close, 20))
```

The
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) over 20,735 script executions show the call to
`pineHighest()` took the most time to execute, with a runtime of 57.9
milliseconds, about 69.3% of the script's total runtime. The
`fasterPineHighest()` call performed much more efficiently, as it only
took about 16.9 milliseconds, approximately 20.2% of the total runtime,
to calculate the same values.

The most efficient *by far*, however, was the
[ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
call, which only required 3.2 milliseconds (~3.8% of the total runtime)
to execute across all the chart's data and compute the same values in
this run:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Using-built-ins-1.CXnfIZo4_ZWjpAS.png)

While these results effectively demonstrate that the built-in function
outperforms our
[user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) with a small `length` argument of 20, it's crucial to
consider that the calculations required by the functions *will vary*
with the argument's value. Therefore, we can profile the code while
using
[different arguments](#profiling-across-configurations) to gauge how its runtime scales.

Here, we changed the `length` argument in each function call from 20 to
200 and
[profiled the script](#profiling-a-script) again to observe the changes in performance. The time spent
on the `pineHighest()` function in this run increased to about 0.6
seconds (~86% of the total runtime), and the time spent on the
`fasterPineHighest()` function increased to about 75 milliseconds. The
[ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
function, on the other hand, *did not* experience a substantial runtime
change. It took about 5.8 milliseconds this time, only a couple of
milliseconds more than the previous run.

In other words, while our
[user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) experienced significant runtime growth with a higher
`length` argument in this run, the change in the built-in
[ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
function's runtime was relatively marginal in this case, thus further
emphasizing its performance benefits:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Using-built-ins-2.wlIsvoLn_Z1yQ1xR.png)

Note that:

- In many scenarios, a script's runtime can benefit from using
  built-ins where applicable. However, the relative performance
  edge achieved from using built-ins depends on a script's
  *high-impact code* and the specific built-ins used. In any case,
  one should always
  [profile their scripts](#profiling-a-script), preferably
  [several times](#repetitive-profiling), when exploring optimized solutions.
- The calculations performed by the functions in this example also
  depend on the sequence of the chart's data. Therefore,
  programmers can gain further insight into their general
  performance by profiling the script across
  [different datasets](#profiling-across-configurations) as well.

### [Reducing repetition](https://www.tradingview.com#reducing-repetition)

The Pine Script™ compiler can automatically simplify some types of
[repetitive code](#insignificant-unused-and-redundant-code) without a programmer's intervention. However, this
automatic process has its limitations. If a script contains repetitive
calculations that the compiler *cannot* reduce, programmers can reduce
the repetition *manually* to improve their script's performance.

For example, this script contains a `valuesAbove()`[method](#user-defined-methods)
that counts the number of elements in an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
above the element at a specified index. The script plots the number of
values above the element at the last index of a `data` array with a
calculated `plotColor`. It calculates the `plotColor` within a
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
structure that calls `valuesAbove()` in all 10 of its conditional
expressions:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reducing repetition demo")

//@function Counts the number of elements in `this` array above the element at a specified `index`.
method valuesAbove(array<float> this, int index) =>
    int result = 0
    float reference = this.get(index)
    for [i, value] in this
        if i == index
            continue
        if value > reference
            result += 1
    result

//@variable An array containing the most recent 100 `close` prices.
var array<float> data = array.new<float>(100)
data.push(close)
data.shift()

//@variable Returns `color.purple` with a varying transparency based on the `valuesAbove()`.
color plotColor = switch
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 10  => color.new(color.purple, 90)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 20  => color.new(color.purple, 80)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 30  => color.new(color.purple, 70)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 40  => color.new(color.purple, 60)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 50  => color.new(color.purple, 50)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 60  => color.new(color.purple, 40)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 70  => color.new(color.purple, 30)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 80  => color.new(color.purple, 20)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 90  => color.new(color.purple, 10)
    data.valuesAbove(99) <= 100 => color.new(color.purple, 0)

// Plot the number values in the `data` array above the value at its last index. 
plot(data.valuesAbove(99), color = plotColor, style = plot.style_area)
```

The
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) for this script show that it spent about 2.5 seconds
executing 21,201 times. The code regions with the highest impact on the
script's runtime are the
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
within the `valuesAbove()` local scope starting on line 8 and the
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)
block that starts on line 21:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Reducing-repetition-1.DzXiqnj9_Z1IB5Dn.png)

Notice that the number of executions shown for the local code within
`valuesAbove()` is substantially *greater* than the number shown for the
code in the script's global scope, as the script calls the method up to
11 times per execution, and the results for a
[function's local code](#user-defined-function-calls) reflect the *combined* time and executions from each
separate call:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Reducing-repetition-2.QnMs1Dg3_ZE1OU8.png)

Although each `valuesAbove()` call uses the *same* arguments and returns
the *same* result, the compiler cannot automatically reduce this code
for us during translation. We will need to do the job ourselves. We can
optimize this script by assigning the value of `data.valuesAbove(99)` to
a *variable* and *reusing* the value in all other areas requiring the
result.

In the version below, we modified the script by adding a `count`
variable to reference the `data.valuesAbove(99)` value. The script uses
this variable in the `plotColor` calculation and the
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
call:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reducing repetition demo")

//@function Counts the number of elements in `this` array above the element at a specified `index`.
method valuesAbove(array<float> this, int index) =>
    int result = 0
    float reference = this.get(index)
    for [i, value] in this
        if i == index
            continue
        if value > reference
            result += 1
    result

//@variable An array containing the most recent 100 `close` prices.
var array<float> data = array.new<float>(100)
data.push(close)
data.shift()

//@variable The number values in the `data` array above the value at its last index.
int count = data.valuesAbove(99)

//@variable Returns `color.purple` with a varying transparency based on the `valuesAbove()`.
color plotColor = switch
    count <= 10  => color.new(color.purple, 90)
    count <= 20  => color.new(color.purple, 80)
    count <= 30  => color.new(color.purple, 70)
    count <= 40  => color.new(color.purple, 60)
    count <= 50  => color.new(color.purple, 50)
    count <= 60  => color.new(color.purple, 40)
    count <= 70  => color.new(color.purple, 30)
    count <= 80  => color.new(color.purple, 20)
    count <= 90  => color.new(color.purple, 10)
    count <= 100 => color.new(color.purple, 0)

// Plot the `count`.
plot(count, color = plotColor, style = plot.style_area)
```

With this modification, the
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) show a significant improvement in performance, as the script
now only needs to evaluate the `valuesAbove()` call **once** per
execution rather than up to 11 separate times:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Reducing-repetition-3.Nge1aqtk_2w60SG.png)

Note that:

- Since this script only calls `valuesAbove()` once, the
  [method's](#user-defined-methods) local code will now reflect the results from that
  specific call. See
  [this section](#user-defined-function-calls) to learn more about interpreting profiled function
  and method call results.

### [Minimizing `request.*()` calls](https://www.tradingview.com#minimizing-request-calls)

The built-in functions in the `request.*()` namespace allow scripts to
retrieve data from
[other contexts](#other-timeframes-and-data). While these functions provide utility in many applications,
it's important to consider that each call to these functions can have a
significant impact on a script's resource usage.

A single script can contain up to 40 calls to the `request.*()` family
of functions. However, users should strive to keep their scripts'
`request.*()` calls well *below* this limit to keep the performance
impact of their data requests as low as possible.

When a script requests the values of several expressions from the *same*
context with multiple
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
or
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
calls, one effective way to optimize such requests is to *condense* them
into a single `request.*()` call that uses a
[tuple](#tuples) as its `expression` argument. This optimization not only
helps improve the runtime of the requests; it also helps reduce the
script's *memory usage* and compiled size.

As a simple example, the following script requests nine
[ta.percentrank()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.percentrank)
values with different lengths from a specified symbol using nine
separate calls to
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security).
It then [plots](#plots) all nine
requested values on the chart to utilize them in the outputs:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Minimizing `request.*()` calls demo")

//@variable The symbol to request data from.
string symbolInput = input.symbol("BINANCE:BTCUSDT", "Symbol")

// Request 9 `ta.percentrank()` values from the `symbolInput` context using 9 `request.security()` calls.
float reqRank1 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 10))
float reqRank2 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 20))
float reqRank3 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 30))
float reqRank4 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 40))
float reqRank5 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 50))
float reqRank6 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 60))
float reqRank7 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 70))
float reqRank8 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 80))
float reqRank9 = request.security(symbolInput, timeframe.period, ta.percentrank(close, 90))

// Plot the `reqRank*` values.
plot(reqRank1)
plot(reqRank2)
plot(reqRank3)
plot(reqRank4)
plot(reqRank5)
plot(reqRank6)
plot(reqRank7)
plot(reqRank8)
plot(reqRank9)
```

The results from
[profiling the script](#profiling-a-script) show that it took the script 340.8 milliseconds to complete
its requests and plot the values in this run:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Minimizing-request-calls-1.Canv49So_1Cn30c.png)

Since all the
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
calls request data from the **same context**, we can optimize the
code's resource usage by merging all of them into a single
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call that uses a
[tuple](#tuples) as its `expression` argument:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Minimizing `request.*()` calls demo")

//@variable The symbol to request data from.
string symbolInput = input.symbol("BINANCE:BTCUSDT", "Symbol")

// Request 9 `ta.percentrank()` values from the `symbolInput` context using a single `request.security()` call.
[reqRank1, reqRank2, reqRank3, reqRank4, reqRank5, reqRank6, reqRank7, reqRank8, reqRank9] = 
 request.security(
     symbolInput, timeframe.period, [
             ta.percentrank(close, 10), ta.percentrank(close, 20), ta.percentrank(close, 30), 
             ta.percentrank(close, 40), ta.percentrank(close, 50), ta.percentrank(close, 60), 
             ta.percentrank(close, 70), ta.percentrank(close, 80), ta.percentrank(close, 90)
         ]
 )

// Plot the `reqRank*` values.
plot(reqRank1)
plot(reqRank2)
plot(reqRank3)
plot(reqRank4)
plot(reqRank5)
plot(reqRank6)
plot(reqRank7)
plot(reqRank8)
plot(reqRank9)
```

As we see below, the
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) from running this version of the script show that it took
228.3 milliseconds this time, a decent improvement over the previous
run:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Minimizing-request-calls-2.BZ75zb8R_Z21D1UV.png)

Note that:

- The computational resources available to a script **fluctuate**
  over time. As such, it's typically a good idea to profile a
  script
  [multiple times](#repetitive-profiling) to help solidify performance conclusions.
- Another way to request multiple values from the same context
  with a single `request.*()` call is to pass an
  [object](#objects) of a
  [user-defined type (UDT)](#user-defined-types) as the `expression` argument. See
  [this section](#user-defined-types) of the
  [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page to learn more about requesting
  [UDTs](#user-defined-types).
- Programmers can also reduce the total runtime of a
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security),
  [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf),
  or
  [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.seed)
  call by passing an argument to the function's `calc_bars_count`
  parameter, which *restricts* the number of *historical* data
  points it can access from a context and execute required
  calculations on. In general, if calls to these `request.*()`
  functions retrieve *more* historical data than what a script
  *needs*, limiting the requests with `calc_bars_count` can help
  improve the script's performance.

### [Avoiding redrawing](https://www.tradingview.com#avoiding-redrawing)

Pine Script™'s
[drawing types](#drawing-types) allow scripts to draw custom visuals on a chart that one
cannot achieve through other outputs such as
[plots](#plots). While these types
provide greater visual flexibility, they also have a *higher* runtime
and memory cost, especially when a script unnecessarily *recreates*
drawings instead of directly updating their properties to change their
appearance.

Most
[drawing types](#drawing-types), excluding
[polylines](#polylines),
feature built-in *setter functions* in their namespaces that allow
scripts to modify a drawing *without* deleting and recreating it.
Utilizing these setters is typically less computationally expensive than
creating a new drawing object when only *specific properties* require
modification.

For example, the script below compares deleting and redrawing
[boxes](#boxes) to using
`box.set*()` functions. On the first bar, it declares the `redrawnBoxes`
and [updatedBoxes``arrays](#arrays)
and executes a [loop](#loops) to push
25 [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box)
elements into them.

The script uses a separate
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
to iterate across the [arrays](#arrays) and update the drawings on each execution. It *recreates*
the [boxes](#boxes) in
the `redrawnBoxes` array using
[box.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.delete)
and
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new),
whereas it *directly modifies* the properties of the
[boxes](#boxes) in the
`updatedBoxes` array using
[box.set_lefttop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_lefttop)
and
[box.set_rightbottom()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_rightbottom).
Both approaches achieve the same visual result. However, the latter is
more efficient:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Avoiding redrawing demo")

//@variable An array of `box` IDs deleted with `box.delete()` and redrawn with `box.new()` on each execution.
var array<box> redrawnBoxes = array.new<box>()
//@variable An array of `box` IDs with properties that update across executions update via `box.set*()` functions.
var array<box> updatedBoxes = array.new<box>()

// Populate both arrays with 25 elements on the first bar. 
if barstate.isfirst
    for i = 1 to 25
        array.push(redrawnBoxes, box(na))
        array.push(updatedBoxes, box.new(na, na, na, na))

for i = 0 to 24
    // Calculate coordinates.
    int x = bar_index - i
    float y = close[i + 1] - close
    // Get the `box` ID from each array at the `i` index.
    box redrawnBox = redrawnBoxes.get(i)
    box updatedBox = updatedBoxes.get(i)
    // Delete the `redrawnBox`, create a new `box` ID, and replace that element in the `redrawnboxes` array.
    box.delete(redrawnBox)
    redrawnBox := box.new(x - 1, y, x, 0.0)
    array.set(redrawnBoxes, i, redrawnBox)
    // Update the properties of the `updatedBox` rather than redrawing it. 
    box.set_lefttop(updatedBox, x - 1, y)
    box.set_rightbottom(updatedBox, x, 0.0)
```

The results from
[profiling this script](#profiling-a-script) show that line 24, which contains the
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new)
call, is the *heaviest* line in the
[code block](#code-block-results) that executes on each bar, with a runtime close to
**double** the combined time spent on the
[box.set_lefttop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_lefttop)
and
[box.set_rightbottom()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_rightbottom)
calls on lines 27 and 28:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Avoiding-redrawing-1.CVCJc2lm_ZJcTqr.png)

Note that:

- The number of executions shown for the loop's *local code* is
  25 times the number shown for the code in the script's *global
  scope*, as each execution of the loop statement triggers 25
  executions of the local block.
- This script updates its drawings over *all bars* in the chart's
  history for **testing** purposes. However, it does **not**
  actually need to execute all these historical updates since
  users will only see the **final** result from the *last
  historical bar* and the changes across *realtime bars*. See the
  [next section](#reducing-drawing-updates) to learn more.

### [Reducing drawing updates](https://www.tradingview.com#reducing-drawing-updates)

When a script produces
[drawing objects](#drawing-types) that change across *historical bars*, users will only ever
see their **final results** on those bars since the script completes its
historical executions when it first loads on the chart. The only time
one will see such drawings *evolve* across executions is during
*realtime bars*, as new data flows in.

Since the evolving outputs from dynamic
[drawings](#drawing-types) on historical bars are **never visible** to a user, one can
often improve a script's performance by *eliminating* the historical
updates that don't impact the final results.

For example, this script creates a
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
with two columns and 21 rows to visualize the history of an
[RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi)
in a paginated, tabular format. The script initializes the cells of the
`infoTable` on the [first
bar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isfirst),
and it references the history of the calculated `rsi` to update the
`text` and `bgcolor` of the cells in the second column within a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
on each bar:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reducing drawing updates demo")

//@variable The first offset shown in the paginated table.
int offsetInput = input.int(0, "Page", 0, 249) * 20

//@variable A table that shows the history of RSI values.
var table infoTable = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 21, border_color = chart.fg_color, border_width = 1)
// Initialize the table's cells on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    table.cell(infoTable, 0, 0, "Offset", text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(infoTable, 1, 0, "RSI", text_color = chart.fg_color)
    for i = 0 to 19
        table.cell(infoTable, 0, i + 1, str.tostring(offsetInput + i))
        table.cell(infoTable, 1, i + 1)

float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)

// Update the history shown in the `infoTable` on each bar. 
for i = 0 to 19
    float historicalRSI = rsi[offsetInput + i]
    table.cell_set_text(infoTable, 1, i + 1, str.tostring(historicalRSI))
    table.cell_set_bgcolor(
         infoTable, 1, i + 1, color.from_gradient(historicalRSI, 30, 70, color.red, color.green)
     )

plot(rsi, "RSI")
```

After
[profiling](#profiling-a-script) the script, we see that the code with the highest impact on
performance is the
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
that starts on line 20, i.e., the
[code block](#code-block-results) that updates the table's cells:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Reducing-drawing-updates-1.DGjGYc9o_Z2h4bJz.png)

This critical code region executes **excessively** across the chart's
history, as users will only see the
[table's](#tables)**final**
historical result. The only time that users will see the
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
update is on the **last historical bar** and across all subsequent
**realtime bars**. Therefore, we can optimize this script's resource
usage by restricting the executions of this code to only the [last
available
bar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast).

In this script version, we placed the
[loop](#loops) that updates the
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table)
cells within an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure that uses
[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast)
as its condition, effectively restricting the code block's executions
to only the last historical bar and all realtime bars. Now, the script
*loads* more efficiently since all the table's calculations only
require **one** historical execution:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Reducing-drawing-updates-2.DVDSH-lG_Z1AqBk6.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reducing drawing updates demo")

//@variable The first offset shown in the paginated table.
int offsetInput = input.int(0, "Page", 0, 249) * 20

//@variable A table that shows the history of RSI values.
var table infoTable = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 21, border_color = chart.fg_color, border_width = 1)
// Initialize the table's cells on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    table.cell(infoTable, 0, 0, "Offset", text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(infoTable, 1, 0, "RSI", text_color = chart.fg_color)
    for i = 0 to 19
        table.cell(infoTable, 0, i + 1, str.tostring(offsetInput + i))
        table.cell(infoTable, 1, i + 1)

float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)

// Update the history shown in the `infoTable` on the last available bar.
if barstate.islast
    for i = 0 to 19
        float historicalRSI = rsi[offsetInput + i]
        table.cell_set_text(infoTable, 1, i + 1, str.tostring(historicalRSI))
        table.cell_set_bgcolor(
             infoTable, 1, i + 1, color.from_gradient(historicalRSI, 30, 70, color.red, color.green)
         )

plot(rsi, "RSI")
```

Note that:

- The script will still update the cells when new **realtime**
  updates come in, as users can observe those changes on the
  chart, unlike the changes that the script used to execute across
  historical bars.

### [Storing calculated values](https://www.tradingview.com#storing-calculated-values)

When a script performs a critical calculation that changes
*infrequently* throughout all executions, one can reduce its runtime by
**saving the result** to a variable declared with the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) or
[varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip)
keywords and **only** updating the value if the calculation changes. If
the script calculates *multiple* values excessively, one can store them
within
[collections](#collections),
[matrices](#matrices), and
[maps](#maps) or
[objects](#objects) of
[user-defined types](#user-defined-types).

Let's look at an example. This script calculates a weighted moving
average with custom weights based on a generalized [window
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function). The
`numerator` is the sum of weighted
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
values, and the `denominator` is the sum of the calculated weights. The
script uses a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
that iterates `lengthInput` times to calculate these sums, then it plots
their ratio, i.e., the resulting average:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Storing calculated values demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the weighted average calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 1, 5000)
//@variable Window coefficient. 
float coefInput = input.float(0.5, "Window coefficient", 0.0, 1.0, 0.01)

//@variable The sum of weighted `close` prices.
float numerator = 0.0
//@variable The sum of weights.
float denominator = 0.0

//@variable The angular step in the cosine calculation.
float step = 2.0 * math.pi / lengthInput
// Accumulate weighted sums.
for i = 0 to lengthInput - 1
    float weight = coefInput - (1 - coefInput) * math.cos(step * i)
    numerator += close[i] * weight
    denominator += weight

// Plot the weighted average result.
plot(numerator / denominator, "Weighted average", color.purple, 3)
```

After
[profiling](#profiling-a-script) the script's performance over our chart's data, we see
that it took about 241.3 milliseconds to calculate the default 50-bar
average across 20,155 chart updates, and the critical code with the
*highest impact* on the script's performance is the loop
[block](#code-block-results) that starts on line 17:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Storing-calculated-values-1.Db6QOvTY_1SK8Tz.png)

Since the number of loop iterations *depends* on the `lengthInput`
value, let's test how its runtime scales with
[another configuration](#profiling-across-configurations) requiring heavier looping. Here, we set the value to 2500.
This time, the script took about 12 seconds to complete all of its
executions:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Storing-calculated-values-2.DsxEbDvA_DT4zd.png)

Now that we've pinpointed the script's *high-impact* code and
established a benchmark to improve, we can inspect the critical code
block to identify optimization opportunities. After examining the
calculations, we can observe the following:

- The only value that causes the `weight` calculation on line 18 to
  vary across loop iterations is the *loop index*. All other values in
  its calculation remain consistent. Consequently, the `weight`
  calculated on each loop iteration **does not vary** across chart
  bars. Therefore, rather than calculating the weights on **every
  update**, we can calculate them **once**, on the first bar, and
  **store them** in a
  [collection](#collections) for future access across subsequent script executions.
- Since the weights never change, the resulting `denominator` never
  changes. Therefore, we can add the
  [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
  keyword to the
  [variable declaration](#variable-declarations) and only calculate its value **once** to reduce the
  number of executed [addition
  assignment](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_+=)
  operations.
- Unlike the `denominator`, we **cannot** store the `numerator` value
  to simplify its calculation since it consistently *changes* over
  time.

In the modified script below, we've added a `weights` variable to
reference an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
that stores each calculated `weight`. This variable and the
`denominator` both include the
[var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var)
keyword in their declarations, meaning the values assigned to them will
*persist* throughout all script executions until explicitly reassigned.
The script calculates their values using a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
that only executes on the [first chart
bar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.isfirst).
Across all other bars, it calculates the `numerator` using a
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop that references the *saved values* from the `weights` array:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Storing calculated values demo", overlay = true)

//@variable The number of bars in the weighted average calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(50, "Length", 1, 5000)
//@variable Window coefficient. 
float coefInput = input.float(0.5, "Window coefficient", 0.0, 1.0, 0.01)

//@variable An array that stores the `weight` values calculated on the first chart bar. 
var array<float> weights = array.new<float>()

//@variable The sum of weighted `close` prices.
float numerator = 0.0
//@variable The sum of weights. The script now only calculates this value on the first bar. 
var float denominator = 0.0

//@variable The angular step in the cosine calculation.
float step = 2.0 * math.pi / lengthInput

// Populate the `weights` array and calculate the `denominator` only on the first bar.
if barstate.isfirst
    for i = 0 to lengthInput - 1
        float weight = coefInput - (1 - coefInput) * math.cos(step * i)
        array.push(weights, weight)
        denominator += weight
// Calculate the `numerator` on each bar using the stored `weights`. 
for [i, w] in weights
    numerator += close[i] * w

// Plot the weighted average result.
plot(numerator / denominator, "Weighted average", color.purple, 3)
```

With this optimized structure, the
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) show that our modified script with a high `lengthInput`
value of 2500 took about 5.9 seconds to calculate across the same data,
about *half* the time of our previous version:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Storing-calculated-values-3.k6QQwb-Z_ZqmRWt.png)

Note that:

- Although we've significantly improved this script's
  performance by saving its *execution-invariant* values to
  variables, it does still involve a higher computational cost
  with **large**`lengthInput` values due to the remaining loop
  calculations that execute on each bar.
- Another, more *advanced* way one can further enhance this
  script's performance is by storing the weights in a
  *single-row*[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_matrix)
  on the first bar, using an
  [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
  as a
  [queue](#using-an-array-as-a-queue) to hold recent
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  values, then replacing the
  [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
  loop with a call to
  [matrix.mult()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.mult).
  See the [Matrices](#matrices)
  page to learn more about working with `matrix.*()` functions.

### [Eliminating loops](https://www.tradingview.com#eliminating-loops)

[Loops](#loops) allow Pine scripts to
perform *iterative* calculations on each execution. Each time a loop
activates, its local code may execute *several times*, often leading to
a *substantial increase* in resource usage.

Pine loops are necessary for *some* calculations, such as manipulating
elements within
[collections](#collections) or looking backward through a dataset's history to
calculate values *only* obtainable on the current bar. However, in many
other cases, programmers use loops when they **don't need to**, leading
to suboptimal runtime performance. In such cases, one may eliminate
unnecessary loops in any of the following ways, depending on what their
calculations entail:

- Identifying simplified, **loop-free expressions** that achieve the
  same result without iteration
- Replacing a loop with optimized
  [built-ins](#using-built-ins) where possible
- Distributing a loop's iterations *across bars* when feasible rather
  than evaluating them all at once

This simple example contains an `avgDifference()` function that
calculates the average difference between the current bar's `source`
value and all the values from `length` previous bars. The script calls
this function to calculate the average difference between the current
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
price and `lengthInput` previous prices, then it
[plots](#plots) the result on the
chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Eliminating loops demo")

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1)

//@function Calculates the average difference between the current `source` and `length` previous `source` values.
avgDifference(float source, int length) =>
    float diffSum = 0.0
    for i = 1 to length
        diffSum += source - source[i]
    diffSum / length

plot(avgDifference(close, lengthInput))
```

After inspecting the script's
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) with the default settings, we see that it took about 64
milliseconds to execute 20,157 times:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Eliminating-loops-1.CagHTlaL_Z1XidNw.png)

Since we use the `lengthInput` as the `length` argument in the
`avgDifference()` call and that argument controls how many times the
loop inside the function must iterate, our script's runtime will
**grow** with the `lengthInput` value. Here, we set the input's value
to 2000 in the script's settings. This time, the script completed its
executions in about 3.8 seconds:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Eliminating-loops-2.GHOgXfCo_Z2hwC8b.png)

As we see from these results, the `avgDifference()` function can be
costly to call, depending on the specified `lengthInput` value, due to
its [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for)
loop that executes on each bar. However,
[loops](#loops) are **not** necessary
to achieve the output. To understand why, let's take a closer look at
the loop's calculations. We can represent them with the following
expression:

```
(source - source[1]) + (source - source[2]) + ... + (source - source[length])
```

Notice that it adds the *current*`source` value `length` times. These
iterative additions are not necessary. We can simplify that part of the
expression to `source * length`, which reduces it to the following:

```
source * length - source[1] - source[2] - ... - source[length]
```

or equivalently:

```
source * length - (source[1] + source[2] + ... + source[length])
```

After simplifying and rearranging this representation of the loop's
calculations, we see that we can compute the result in a simpler way and
**eliminate** the loop by subtracting the previous bar's [rolling
sum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sum)
of `source` values from the `source * length` value, i.e.:

```
source * length - math.sum(source, length)[1]
```

The `fastAvgDifference()` function below is a **loop-free** alternative
to the original `avgDifference()` function that uses the above
expression to calculate the sum of `source` differences, then divides
the expression by the `length` to return the average difference:

```
//@function A faster way to calculate the `avgDifference()` result. 
//          Eliminates the `for` loop using the relationship: 
//          `(x - x[1]) + (x - x[2]) + ... + (x - x[n]) = x * n - math.sum(x, n)[1]`.
fastAvgDifference(float source, int length) =>
    (source * length - math.sum(source, length)[1]) / length
```

Now that we've identified a potential optimized solution, we can
compare the performance of `fastAvgDifference()` to the original
`avgDifference()` function. The script below is a modified form of the
previous version that plots the results from calling both functions with
the `lengthInput` as the `length` argument:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Eliminating loops demo")

//@variable The number of bars in the calculation.
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", 1)

//@function Calculates the average difference between the current `source` and `length` previous `source` values.
avgDifference(float source, int length) =>
    float diffSum = 0.0
    for i = 1 to length
        diffSum += source - source[i]
    diffSum / length

//@function A faster way to calculate the `avgDifference()` result. 
//          Eliminates the `for` loop using the relationship: 
//          `(x - x[1]) + (x - x[2]) + ... + (x - x[n]) = x * n - math.sum(x, n)[1]`.
fastAvgDifference(float source, int length) =>
    (source * length - math.sum(source, length)[1]) / length

plot(avgDifference(close, lengthInput))
plot(fastAvgDifference(close, lengthInput))
```

The
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) for the script with the default `lengthInput` of 20 show a
substantial difference in runtime spent on the two function calls. The
call to the original function took about 47.3 milliseconds to execute
20,157 times on this run, whereas our optimized function only took 4.5
milliseconds:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Eliminating-loops-3.DiuPpBDh_1dyGfx.png)

Now, let's compare the performance with the *heavier*`lengthInput`
value of 2000. As before, the runtime spent on the `avgDifference()`
function increased significantly. However, the time spent executing the
`fastAvgDifference()` call remained very close to the result from the
previous
[configuration](#profiling-across-configurations). In other words, while our original function's runtime
scales directly with its `length` argument, our optimized function
demonstrates relatively *consistent* performance since it does not
require a loop:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Eliminating-loops-4.V8AwhZcD_23XFmP.png)

### [Optimizing loops](https://www.tradingview.com#optimizing-loops)

Although Pine's
[execution model](#execution-model) and
the available built-ins often *eliminate* the need for
[loops](#loops) in many cases, there
are still instances where a script **will** require
[loops](#loops) for some types of
tasks, including:

- Manipulating
  [collections](#collections) or executing calculations over a collection's elements
  when the available built-ins **will not** suffice
- Performing calculations across historical bars that one **cannot**
  achieve with simplified *loop-free* expressions or optimized
  *built-ins*
- Calculating values that are **only** obtainable through iteration

When a script uses [loops](#loops)
that a programmer cannot
[eliminate](#eliminating-loops), there are [several
techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_optimization) one can use
to reduce their performance impact. This section explains two of the
most common, useful techniques that can help improve a required loop's
efficiency.

#### [Reducing loop calculations](https://www.tradingview.com#reducing-loop-calculations)

The code executed within a [loop's](#loops) local scope can have a **multiplicative** impact on its
overall runtime, as each time a loop statement executes, it will
typically trigger *several* iterations of the local code. Therefore,
programmers should strive to keep a loop's calculations as simple as
possible by eliminating unnecessary structures, function calls, and
operations to minimize the performance impact, especially when the
script must evaluate its loops *numerous times* throughout all its
executions.

For example, this script contains a `filteredMA()` function that
calculates a moving average of up to `length` unique `source` values,
depending on the `true` elements in a specified `mask`[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).
The function queues the unique `source` values into a `data`[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array),
uses a
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop to iterate over the `data` and calculate the `numerator` and
`denominator` sums, then returns the ratio of those sums. Within the
loop, it only adds values to the sums when the `data` element is not
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) and
the `mask` element at the `index` is `true`. The script utilizes this
[user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) to calculate the average of up to 100 unique
[close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
prices filtered by a `randMask` and plots the result on the chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reducing loop calculations demo", overlay = true)

//@function Calculates a moving average of up to `length` unique `source` values filtered by a `mask` array.
filteredMA(float source, int length, array<bool> mask) =>
    // Raise a runtime error if the size of the `mask` doesn't equal the `length`.
    if mask.size() != length
        runtime.error("The size of the `mask` array used in the `filteredMA()` call must match the `length`.")
    //@variable An array containing `length` unique `source` values.
    var array<float> data = array.new<float>(length)
    // Queue unique `source` values into the `data` array.
    if not data.includes(source)
        data.push(source)
        data.shift()
    // The numerator and denominator of the average.
    float numerator   = 0.0
    float denominator = 0.0
    // Loop to calculate sums.
    for item in data
        if na(item)
            continue
        int index = array.indexof(data, item)
        if mask.get(index)
            numerator   += item
            denominator += 1.0
    // Return the average, or the last non-`na` average value if the current value is `na`.
    fixnan(numerator / denominator)

//@variable An array of 100 pseudorandom "bool" values.
var array<bool> randMask = array.new<bool>(100, true)
// Push the first element from `randMask` to the end and queue a new pseudorandom value.
randMask.push(randMask.shift())
randMask.push(math.random(seed = 12345) < 0.5)
randMask.shift()

// Plot the `filteredMA()` of up to 100 unique `close` values filtered by the `randMask`.
plot(filteredMA(close, 100, randMask))
```

After
[profiling the script](#profiling-a-script), we see it took about two seconds to execute 21,778 times.
The code with the highest performance impact is the expression on line
37, which calls the `filteredMA()` function. Within the `filteredMA()`
function's scope, the
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop has the highest impact, with the `index` calculation in the loop's
scope (line 22) contributing the most to the loop's runtime:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Optimizing-loops-Reducing-loop-calculations-1.DATOq5cw_2jUPjt.png)

The above code demonstrates suboptimal usage of a
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop, as we **do not** need to call
[array.indexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.indexof)
to retrieve the `index` in this case. The
[array.indexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.indexof)
function can be *costly* to call within a loop since it must search
through the [array's](#arrays)
contents and locate the corresponding element's index *each time* the
script calls it.

To eliminate this costly call from our
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop, we can use the *second form* of the structure, which produces a
*tuple* containing the **index** and the element's value on each
iteration:

```
for [index, item] in data
```

In this version of the script, we removed the
[array.indexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.indexof)
call on line 22 since it is **not** necessary to achieve the intended
result, and we changed the
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop to use the alternative form:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reducing loop calculations demo", overlay = true)

//@function Calculates a moving average of up to `length` unique `source` values filtered by a `mask` array.
filteredMA(float source, int length, array<bool> mask) =>
    // Raise a runtime error if the size of the `mask` doesn't equal the `length`.
    if mask.size() != length
        runtime.error("The size of the `mask` array used in the `filteredMA()` call must match the `length`.")
    //@variable An array containing `length` unique `source` values.
    var array<float> data = array.new<float>(length)
    // Queue unique `source` values into the `data` array.
    if not data.includes(source)
        data.push(source)
        data.shift()
    // The numerator and denominator of the average.
    float numerator   = 0.0
    float denominator = 0.0
    // Loop to calculate sums.
    for [index, item] in data
        if na(item)
            continue
        if mask.get(index)
            numerator   += item
            denominator += 1.0
    // Return the average, or the last non-`na` average value if the current value is `na`.
    fixnan(numerator / denominator)

//@variable An array of 100 pseudorandom "bool" values.
var array<bool> randMask = array.new<bool>(100, true)
// Push the first element from `randMask` to the end and queue a new pseudorandom value.
randMask.push(randMask.shift())
randMask.push(math.random(seed = 12345) < 0.5)
randMask.shift()

// Plot the `filteredMA()` of up to 100 unique `close` values filtered by the `randMask`. 
plot(filteredMA(close, 100, randMask))
```

With this simple change, our loop is much more efficient, as it no
longer needs to redundantly search through the
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array)
on each iteration to keep track of the index. The
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) from this script run show that it took only 0.6 seconds to
complete its executions, a significant improvement over the previous
version's result:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Optimizing-loops-Reducing-loop-calculations-2.ChKixPxa_1dGXff.png)

#### [Loop-invariant code motion](https://www.tradingview.com#loop-invariant-code-motion)

*Loop-invariant code* is any code region within a
[loop's](#loops) scope that produces
an **unchanging** result on each iteration. When a script's
[loops](#loops) contain loop-invariant
code, it can substantially impact performance in some cases due to
excessive, **unnecessary** calculations.

Programmers can optimize a loop with invariant code by *moving* the
unchanging calculations **outside** the loop's scope so the script only
needs to evaluate them once per execution rather than repetitively.

The following example contains a `featureScale()` function that creates
a rescaled version of an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array).
Within the function's
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop, it scales each element by calculating its distance from the
[array.min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min)
and dividing the value by the
[array.range()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.range).
The script uses this function to create a `rescaled` version of a
`prices` array and [plots](#plots) the
difference between the
[rescaled.first()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.first)
and
[rescaled.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg)
values on the chart:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Loop-invariant code motion demo")

//@function Returns a feature scaled version of `this` array.
featureScale(array<float> this) =>
    array<float> result = array.new<float>()
    for item in this
        result.push((item - array.min(this)) / array.range(this))
    result

//@variable An array containing the most recent 100 `close` prices.
var array<float> prices = array.new<float>(100, close)
// Queue the `close` through the `prices` array.
prices.unshift(close)
prices.pop()

//@variable A feature scaled version of the `prices` array.
array<float> rescaled = featureScale(prices)

// Plot the difference between the first element and the average value in the `rescaled` array.
plot(rescaled.first() - rescaled.avg())
```

As we see below, the
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) for this script after 20,187 executions show it completed
its run in about 3.3 seconds. The code with the highest impact on
performance is the line containing the `featureScale()` function call,
and the function's critical code is the
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop block starting on line 7:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Optimizing-loops-Loop-invariant-code-motion-1.BAn098-h_10uiO5.png)

Upon examining the loop's calculations, we can see that the
[array.min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min)
and
[array.range()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.range)
calls on line 8 are **loop-invariant**, as they will always produce the
**same result** across each iteration. We can make our loop much more
efficient by assigning the results from these calls to variables
**outside** its scope and referencing them as needed.

The `featureScale()` function in the script below assigns the
[array.min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.min)
and
[array.range()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.range)
values to `minValue` and `rangeValue` variables *before* executing the
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in)
loop. Inside the loop's local scope, it *references* the variables
across its iterations rather than repetitively calling these `array.*()`
functions:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Loop-invariant code motion demo")

//@function Returns a feature scaled version of `this` array.
featureScale(array<float> this) =>
    array<float> result = array.new<float>()
    float minValue      = array.min(this)
    float rangeValue    = array.range(this)
    for item in this
        result.push((item - minValue) / rangeValue)
    result

//@variable An array containing the most recent 100 `close` prices.
var array<float> prices = array.new<float>(100, close)
// Queue the `close` through the `prices` array.
prices.unshift(close)
prices.pop()

//@variable A feature scaled version of the `prices` array.
array<float> rescaled = featureScale(prices)

// Plot the difference between the first element and the average value in the `rescaled` array.
plot(rescaled.first() - rescaled.avg())
```

As we see from the script's
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results), moving the *loop-invariant* calculations outside the loop
leads to a substantial performance improvement. This time, the script
completed its executions in only 289.3 milliseconds:

### [Minimizing historical buffer calculations](https://www.tradingview.com#minimizing-historical-buffer-calculations)

Pine scripts create *historical buffers* for all variables and function
calls their outputs depend on. Each buffer contains information about
the range of historical values the script can access with the
history-referencing operator
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D).

A script *automatically* determines the required buffer size for all its
variables and function calls by analyzing the historical references
executed during the **first 244 bars** in a dataset. When a script only
references the history of a calculated value *after* those initial bars,
it will **restart** its executions repetitively across previous bars
with successively larger historical buffers until it either determines
the appropriate size or raises a runtime error. Those repetitive
executions can significantly increase a script's runtime in some cases.

When a script *excessively* executes across a dataset to calculate
historical buffers, one effective way to improve its performance is
*explicitly* defining suitable buffer sizes using the
[max_bars_back()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back)
function. With appropriate buffer sizes declared explicitly, the script
does not need to re-execute across past data to determine the sizes.

For example, the script below uses a
[polyline](#polylines)
to draw a basic histogram representing the distribution of calculated
`source` values over 500 bars. On the [last available
bar](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast),
the script uses a
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop
to look back through historical values of the calculated `source` series
and determine the
[chart points](#chart-points) used by the
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
drawing. It also [plots](#plots) the
value of `bar_index + 1` to verify the number of bars it executed
across:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Minimizing historical buffer calculations demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A polyline with points that form a histogram of `source` values.
var polyline display = na
//@variable The difference Q3 of `high` prices and Q1 of `low` prices over 500 bars.
float innerRange = ta.percentile_nearest_rank(high, 500, 75) - ta.percentile_nearest_rank(low, 500, 25)
// Calculate the highest and lowest prices, and the total price range, over 500 bars.
float highest    = ta.highest(500)
float lowest     = ta.lowest(500)
float totalRange = highest - lowest

//@variable The source series for histogram calculation. Its value is the midpoint between the `open` and `close`.
float source = math.avg(open, close)

if barstate.islast
    polyline.delete(display)
    // Calculate the number of histogram bins and their size.
    int   bins    = int(math.round(5 * totalRange / innerRange))
    float binSize = totalRange / bins
    //@variable An array of chart points for the polyline.
    array<chart.point> points = array.new<chart.point>(bins, chart.point.new(na, na, na))
    // Loop to build the histogram.
    for i = 0 to 499
        //@variable The histogram bin number. Uses past values of the `source` for its calculation.
        //          The script must execute across all previous bars AGAIN to determine the historical buffer for 
        //          `source`, as initial references to the calculated series occur AFTER the first 244 bars. 
        int index = int((source[i] - lowest) / binSize)
        if na(index)
            continue
        chart.point currentPoint = points.get(index)
        if na(currentPoint.index)
            points.set(index, chart.point.from_index(bar_index + 1, (index + 0.5) * binSize + lowest))
            continue
        currentPoint.index += 1
    // Add final points to the `points` array and draw the new `display` polyline.
    points.unshift(chart.point.now(lowest))
    points.push(chart.point.now(highest))
    display := polyline.new(points, closed = true)

plot(bar_index + 1, "Number of bars", display = display.data_window)
```

Since the script *only* references past `source` values on the *last
bar*, it will **not** construct a suitable historical buffer for the
series within the first 244 bars on a larger dataset. Consequently, it
will **re-execute** across all historical bars to identify the
appropriate buffer size.

As we see from the
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) after running the script across 20,320 bars, the number of
*global* code executions was 162,560, which is **eight times** the
number of chart bars. In other words, the script had to *repeat* the
historical executions **seven more times** to determine the appropriate
buffer for the `source` series in this case:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Minimizing-historical-buffer-calculations-1.Cyx3FoQJ_Z1xcPM1.png)

This script will only reference the most recent 500 `source` values on
the last historical bar and all realtime bars. Therefore, we can help it
establish the correct buffer *without* re-execution by defining a
500-bar referencing length with
[max_bars_back()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back).

In the following script version, we added [max_bars_back(source,
500)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back)
after the variable declaration to explicitly specify that the script
will access up to 500 historical `source` values throughout its
executions:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Minimizing historical buffer calculations demo", overlay = true)

//@variable A polyline with points that form a histogram of `source` values.
var polyline display = na
//@variable The difference Q3 of `high` prices and Q1 of `low` prices over 500 bars.
float innerRange = ta.percentile_nearest_rank(high, 500, 75) - ta.percentile_nearest_rank(low, 500, 25)
// Calculate the highest and lowest prices, and the total price range, over 500 bars.
float highest    = ta.highest(500)
float lowest     = ta.lowest(500)
float totalRange = highest - lowest

//@variable The source series for histogram calculation. Its value is the midpoint between the `open` and `close`.
float source = math.avg(open, close)
// Explicitly define a 500-bar historical buffer for the `source` to prevent recalculation.
max_bars_back(source, 500)

if barstate.islast
    polyline.delete(display)
    // Calculate the number of histogram bins and their size.
    int   bins    = int(math.round(5 * totalRange / innerRange))
    float binSize = totalRange / bins
    //@variable An array of chart points for the polyline.
    array<chart.point> points = array.new<chart.point>(bins, chart.point.new(na, na, na))
    // Loop to build the histogram.
    for i = 0 to 499
        //@variable The histogram bin number. Uses past values of the `source` for its calculation.
        //          Since the `source` now has an appropriate predefined buffer, the script no longer needs 
        //          to recalculate across previous bars to determine the referencing length. 
        int index = int((source[i] - lowest) / binSize)
        if na(index)
            continue
        chart.point currentPoint = points.get(index)
        if na(currentPoint.index)
            points.set(index, chart.point.from_index(bar_index + 1, (index + 0.5) * binSize + lowest))
            continue
        currentPoint.index += 1
    // Add final points to the `points` array and draw the new `display` polyline.
    points.unshift(chart.point.now(lowest))
    points.push(chart.point.now(highest))
    display := polyline.new(points, closed = true)

plot(bar_index + 1, "Number of bars", display = display.data_window)
```

With this change, our script no longer needs to re-execute across all
the historical data to determine the buffer size. As we see in the
[profiled results](#interpreting-profiled-results) below, the number of global code executions now aligns with
the number of chart bars, and the script took substantially less time to
complete all of its historical executions:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Optimization-Minimizing-historical-buffer-calculations-2.DPrfVLfJ_Z1XIu4W.png)

Note that:

- This script only requires up to the most recent 501 historical
  bars to calculate its drawing output. In this case, another way
  to optimize resource usage is to include `calc_bars_count = 501`
  in the
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
  function, which reduces unnecessary script executions by
  restricting the historical data the script can calculate across
  to 501 bars.

## [Tips](https://www.tradingview.com#tips)

### [Working around Profiler overhead](https://www.tradingview.com#working-around-profiler-overhead)

Since the
[Pine Profiler](#pine-profiler) must perform *extra calculations* to collect performance
data, as explained in
[this section](#a-look-into-the-profilers-inner-workings), the time it takes to execute a script **increases** while
profiling.

Most scripts will run as expected with the Profiler's overhead
included. However, when a complex script's runtime approaches a
[plan's
limit](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000579793/),
using the
[Profiler](#pine-profiler) on it may cause its runtime to *exceed* the limit. Such a
case indicates that the script likely needs
[optimization](#optimization), but it can be challenging to know where to start without
being able to
[profile the code](#profiling-a-script). The most effective workaround in this scenario is reducing
the number of bars the script must execute on. Users can achieve this
reduction in any of the following ways:

- Selecting a dataset that has fewer data points in its history, e.g.,
  a higher timeframe or a symbol with limited data
- Using conditional logic to limit code executions to a specific time
  or bar range
- Including a `calc_bars_count` argument in the script's declaration
  statement to specify how many recent historical bars it can use

Reducing the number of data points works in most cases because it
directly decreases the number of times the script must execute,
typically resulting in less accumulated runtime.

As a demonstration, this script contains a `gcd()` function that uses a
*naive* algorithm to calculate the [greatest common
divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of two
integers. The function initializes its `result` using the smallest
absolute value of the two numbers. Then, it reduces the value of the
`result` by one within a
[while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while)
loop until it can divide both numbers without remainders. This structure
entails that the loop will iterate up to *N* times, where *N* is the
smallest of the two arguments.

In this example, the script plots the value of
`gcd(10000, 10000 + bar_index)`. The smallest of the two arguments is
always 10,000 in this case, meaning the
[while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while)
loop within the function will require up to 10,000 iterations per script
execution, depending on the
[bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index)
value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Script takes too long while profiling demo")

//@function Calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using a naive algorithm.
gcd(int a, int b) =>
    //@variable The greatest common divisor.
    int result = math.max(math.min(math.abs(a), math.abs(b)), 1)
    // Reduce the `result` by 1 until it divides `a` and `b` without remainders. 
    while result > 0
        if a % result == 0 and b % result == 0
            break
        result -= 1
    // Return the `result`.
    result

plot(gcd(10000, 10000 + bar_index), "GCD")
```

When we add the script to our chart, it takes a while to execute across
our chart's data, but it does not raise an error. However, *after*
enabling the
[Profiler](#pine-profiler), the script raises a runtime error stating that it exceeded
the Premium plan's [runtime
limit](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000579793/) (40
seconds):

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Tips-Working-around-profiler-overhead-The-script-takes-too-long-to-execute-1.ChWuvP-N_1heDWT.png)

Our current chart has over 20,000 historical bars, which may be too many
for the script to handle within the alloted time while the
[Profiler](#pine-profiler) is active. We can try limiting the number of historical
executions to work around the issue in this case.

Below, we included `calc_bars_count = 10000` in the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
function, which limits the script's available history to the most
recent 10,000 historical bars. After restricting the script's
historical executions, it no longer exceeds the Premium plan's limit
while profiling, so we can now inspect its performance results:

![image](images/Profiling-and-optimization-Tips-Working-around-profiler-overhead-The-script-takes-too-long-to-execute-2.DN-scZLp_Z1HYEfF.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Script takes too long while profiling demo", calc_bars_count = 10000)

//@function Calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using a naive algorithm.
gcd(int a, int b) =>
    //@variable The greatest common divisor.
    int result = math.max(math.min(math.abs(a), math.abs(b)), 1)
    // Reduce the `result` by 1 until it divides `a` and `b` without remainders.
    while result > 0
        if a % result == 0 and b % result == 0
            break
        result -= 1
    // Return the `result`.
    result

plot(gcd(10000, 10000 + bar_index), "GCD")
```

# [Publishing scripts](https://www.tradingview.com#publishing-scripts)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

TradingView hosts a large global community of Pine Script™ programmers, and millions of traders. Script authors can publish their custom [indicators](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategies](#strategies), and [libraries](#libraries) publicly in the [Community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/) repository, allowing others in our community to use and learn from them. They can also publish *private* scripts to create *drafts* for public releases, test features, or collaborate with friends.

This page explains the script publishing process and provides recommendations to help authors publish their Pine scripts effectively.

## [Script publications](https://www.tradingview.com#script-publications)

When an *editable* script is on the chart and opened in the Pine Editor, users can select the "Publish indicator/strategy/library" button in the top-right corner to open the "Publish script" window and create a *script publication*:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-publications-1.DnSBWpGz_1tN7EV.png)

After the author follows all the necessary steps to [prepare the publication](#preparing-a-publication) and selects the "Publish private/public script" button on the last page of the "Publish script" window, TradingView generates a dedicated *script widget* and *script page*, which feature options for users to boost, share, report, and comment on the publication.

The script widget is a *preview* of the publication that appears in all relevant locations on TradingView, depending on the specified [privacy](#privacy-types) and [visibility](#visibility-types) settings. It shows the script's title, a compressed view of the published chart, and a brief preview of the script's description. An icon in the top-right corner of the widget indicates whether the published script is an [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy](#strategies), or [library](#libraries):

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-publications-2.M-sNA1ym_NPiex.png)

Clicking on the widget opens the script page. The top of the page shows information about the script's visibility, its title, and an enlarged view of the published chart:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-publications-3.UOKF_zpu_F01wn.png)

For published [strategies](#strategies), the script page also includes the option for users to view the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) report below the title.

Below the chart or strategy report are the publication's complete description, release notes from script updates, additional information, and user comments.

## [Privacy types](https://www.tradingview.com#privacy-types)

Script publications have one of two *privacy types*, which determine how users can discover them: [public](#public) or [private](#private). Public scripts are discoverable to all members of the TradingView community, whereas private scripts are accessible only via their URLs. Authors set a script publication's privacy type using the "Privacy settings" field on the *second page* of the "Publish script" window:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Privacy-types-1.BnmBYQ1e_1hNNwl.png)

### [Public](https://www.tradingview.com#public)

A script published with the "Public" setting is available in the [Community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/) feed and discoverable to all TradingView users worldwide. Unlike public ideas, everyone accesses the same *global repository* for public scripts, regardless of which localized TradingView version they use.

Users can discover public scripts by navigating the Community scripts feed directly, viewing the [Scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/u/#published-scripts) tab of an author's profile, searching the "Community" tab of the "Indicators, Metrics & Strategies" menu, or specifying script keywords in the search bar at the top of many TradingView pages. We also feature exceptional public scripts in our [Editors' picks](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/editors-picks/).

Because public scripts are available to our global community and are **not** for private use, they must meet the criteria defined in our [House Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/house-rules/), [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/), and [Vendor Requirements](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000549951-vendor-requirements/). Our *script moderators* analyze public scripts using these criteria. Script publications that do not follow these rules become *hidden* from the community.

### [Private](https://www.tradingview.com#private)

A script published with the "Private" setting is *not* available in the [Community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/) feed, and users cannot find the publication using TradingView's search features. The script widget is visible only to the author, from their profile's [Scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/u/#published-scripts) tab. Other users cannot see the script widget, and they cannot view the script page without having access to its URL.

Authors can **always** edit or delete private script publications, unlike [public](#public) scripts, using the available options in the top-right corner of the script page. This capability makes private scripts ideal for testing features, collaborating with friends, and creating [draft publications](#private-drafts) before committing to public releases. To learn more about how private publications differ from public ones, see [this article](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000548335-how-do-private-ideas-and-scripts-differ-from-public-ones/) in our Help Center.

## [Visibility types](https://www.tradingview.com#visibility-types)

A script publication's *visibility type* determines whether other users can see the source code, and whether anyone or only authorized individuals can use the script. The possible types are [open-source](#open), [protected](#protected), and [invite-only](#invite-only). The "Visibility" options on the *second page* of the "Publish script" window specify a script's visibility type:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Visibility-types-1.24sDTcIC_Z21HgEp.png)

### [Open](https://www.tradingview.com#open)

A script published with the "Open" setting is *open-source*, meaning anyone who views the publication or uses the script can access its Pine Script™ code. Most script publications on TradingView use this setting because it allows programmers to demonstrate their Pine knowledge and provide code for others to verify, learn from, modify, and build upon.

An open-source script's page displays the source code in an expandable window above the comments. The window also includes the option to view the source code directly inside the Pine Editor in a separate tab:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Visibility-types-Open-1.CzBDzAer_2reajX.png)

When a user adds the script to their chart, they can also view the source code in the Pine Editor at any time by selecting the "Source code" option in the script's status line:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Visibility-types-Open-2.DYGvnMMe_Zy0yxC.png)

Note that:

- When a published script's code is open inside the Pine Editor, it is *read-only*. Users cannot edit the code without creating a *working copy*, and any changes to that copied code do **not** affect the original published script.
- All open-source scripts on TradingView use the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/) by default. Authors wanting to use alternative licenses can specify them in the source code.
- All script publications that *reuse* code from another open-source script must meet the "Open-source reuse" criteria outlined in our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/). These rules take precedence over any provisions from an open-source license.

### [Protected](https://www.tradingview.com#protected)

A script published with the "Protected" setting has *closed-source* code, meaning the code is protected and not viewable to any user except the author. Although users cannot access the source code, they can add the script to their charts and use it freely. This visibility option is available only to script authors with paid [plans](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/).

Closed-source script publications are ideal for authors wanting to share their unique Pine Script™ creations with the community without exposing their distinct calculations and logic. They are *not* for sharing closed-source scripts that reproduce the behaviors of [open-source](#open) ones. As such, when an author publishes a closed-source script, the publication's description should include information that helps users understand the script's unique characteristics that require protecting the code. See our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/) to learn more.

### [Invite-only](https://www.tradingview.com#invite-only)

A script published with the "Invite-only" setting has closed-source code. No user except the author can view the code. Additionally, unlike a [protected](#protected) script, only users *invited* by the author can add the script to their charts and use it. This visibility option is available only to script authors with Premium and higher-tier [plans](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/).

Below the description on the invite-only script page, the author can see a *"Manage access"* button. This button opens a dialog box where the author specifies which users have access to the script:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Visibility-types-Invite-only-1.CHvlN2xa_BJGaP.png)

Script authors typically use invite-only publications to provide interested users with unique scripts, often in exchange for payment. As such, invite-only script authors are considered *vendors*. In addition to the [House Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/house-rules/) and [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/), which apply to *all* script authors, vendors must understand and follow our [Vendor Requirements](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000549951-vendor-requirements/).

## [Preparing a publication](https://www.tradingview.com#preparing-a-publication)

At the start of the script publishing process, authors verify and refine their [source code](#source-code) to ensure correct functionality. Then, they prepare their [chart visuals](#chart) and, for strategies, the [strategy report](#strategy-report), to showcase their script's behaviors. After finalizing these details, authors select the "Publish…" button to open the "Publish script" window, where they set the [title](#title-and-description), write a helpful [description](#title-and-description), and then define the publication's [settings](#publication-settings).

The sections below provide a step-by-step overview of this preparation process and list practical recommendations for creating helpful, user-friendly publications based on our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/) and best practices.

### [Source code](https://www.tradingview.com#source-code)

When an author publishes a script, the publication creates an independent copy of the source code, which becomes part of the publication's *version history*. If the published code contains incorrect or misleading calculations, produces unexpected behaviors, or uses excessive runtime resources, those issues are only fixable through [script updates](#script-updates).

Therefore, regardless of a publication's intended [visibility type](#visibility-types), we recommend validating the source code *before* publishing it to confirm that the script is readable, usable, programmed correctly, and compliant.

When preparing source code to publish:

- Ensure the code is original to you and provides a potentially helpful script for the community.
- Use debugging techniques such as [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) to verify that the script works as intended, and to find and fix any issues in its calculations or logic.
- Fix any higher-timeframe [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) calls that use a *non-offset*`expression` argument and [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_on) as the `lookahead` argument on historical bars. These calls are not suitable for script publications because they cause *lookahead bias*. See the [`lookahead`](#lookahead) section of the [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page for more information.
- Use the [Pine Profiler](#pine-profiler) to analyze the script's runtime performance. If the script contains unnecessary loops or other inefficient calculations, consider optimizing them to help ensure efficiency and usability.
- Include `minval`, `maxval`, and `options` arguments in applicable `input.*()` calls to prevent users from supplying *unintended*[input](#inputs) values. It is also helpful to include [runtime.error()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_runtime.error) calls for other unintended use cases.
- Organize the source code, add helpful titles to inputs and plots, use readable names for identifiers, and include informative comments to make the code simpler to maintain and easier to understand. See the [Style guide](#style-guide) page for more information.
- Document exported functions and types of [libraries](#libraries) with [compiler annotations](#compiler-annotations). Annotation text is visible when hovering over an imported library's identifiers or by using parameter hints. Additionally, the [description](#title-and-description) field of the "Publish script" window automatically adds the text to exported code signatures.
- Use a meaningful, searchable title relating to the script's purpose as the `title` argument of the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), or [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library) declaration statement. The title field of the "Publish script" window uses this text by default.

### [Chart](https://www.tradingview.com#chart)

When an author publishes a script, the publication *copies* their current chart to showcase the visual outputs. If the author has drawings, images, or other scripts on their chart, the published chart also includes them. Therefore, before opening the "Publish script" window, confirm that the chart is clean and ready for publishing.

When preparing a chart for a script publication:

- The script must be active on the chart. If the script is not running on the current chart, open its source code in the Pine Editor and select "Add to chart" in the top-right corner.
- Ensure the chart contains only *necessary* visuals and is easy for users to understand. Remove any other scripts, drawings, or images unless using or demonstrating the script *requires* them. If the publication requires extra scripts or other visuals on the chart, explain their use in the [description](#title-and-description).
- The chart's *status line* should show the current symbol and timeframe, and the script's status line should show its name. These details help users understand what the displayed data represents. Enable the "Title/Titles" checkboxes in the "Status line" tab of the chart's settings. If the text in the status lines is the same color as the chart's background, change its color in the "Canvas" tab.
- The symbol's price series and the script's visual outputs should be visible on the chart. If the script is on the chart but hidden, select the "Show" icon in its status line to make it visible. If the symbol's price series is invisible, select the "Show" option in the "More" menu of the chart's status line.
- Show the script's *default* behavior so that users know what to expect when they add it to their charts. If an instance of the script on the chart does not use the default settings, select "Reset settings" from the "Defaults" dropdown tab at the bottom of the script's "Settings" menu.
- Do not use a *non-standard chart* ([Heikin Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000619436), [Renko](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502284), [Line Break](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502273), [Kagi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502272), [Point & Figure](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502276), or [Range](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000474007)) if the script is a [strategy](#strategies), issues [alerts](#alerts), or displays trade signals of *any kind* in its outputs. The OHLC series on non-standard charts represent *synthetic* (calculated) prices, **not** real-world prices. Scripts that create alert conditions or simulate trades on these charts can **mislead** users and produce **unrealistic** results.

### [Strategy report](https://www.tradingview.com#strategy-report)

[Strategies](#strategies) simulate trades based on programmed rules, displaying their hypothetical performance results and properties inside the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester). When an author publishes a strategy script, the script page uses the Strategy Tester's information to populate its *"Strategy report"* display.

Because traders often use a strategy script's performance information to determine the potential viability of a trading system, programmers must verify that their scripts have *realistic* properties and results. Before publishing a strategy script, check its information in the "Strategy Tester" tab to validate that everything appears as intended.

To maintain realism when publishing strategies, follow these guidelines based on our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/):

- In the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, choose an `initial_capital` argument representing realistic starting capital for the average trader in the market. Do not use an excessive value to exaggerate hypothetical returns.
- Specify `commission_*` and `slippage` arguments that approximate real-world commission and slippage amounts. We also recommend using `margin_*` arguments that reflect realistic [margin/leverage](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000717375/) levels for the chart symbol's exchange.
- Set the strategy's order placement logic to risk *sustainable* capital in the simulated trades. In most real-world settings, risking more than 10% of equity on a single trade is *not* typically considered sustainable.
- Choose a dataset and default strategy configuration that produces a reasonable number of simulated trades, ideally *100 or more*. A strategy report with significantly fewer trades, especially over a short duration, does not typically provide enough information to help traders gauge a strategy's hypothetical performance.
- Ensure the strategy uses the default [properties](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000628599-strategy-properties/) set in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement, and explain these defaults in the [description](#title-and-description).
- Resolve any warnings shown in the Strategy Tester before publishing the script.

### [Title and description](https://www.tradingview.com#title-and-description)

After preparing the [source code](#source-code), [chart visuals](#chart), and [strategy report](#strategy-report) for a script publication, open the "Publish Script" window and draft a meaningful title and description to help users understand the script. First, confirm that the correct code is open in the Pine Editor, then select the "Publish…" button in the top-right corner.

The first page of the "Publish Script" window contains two text fields that *cannot* be empty:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Preparing-a-publication-Title-and-description-1.Bo4FS72F_Z2rCw2S.png)

The first field determines the publication's *title*, which appears at the top of the script widget and page. TradingView also uses the specified title to determine the publication's *URL*. By default, this field proposes the text from the `title` argument of the script's declaration statement. It is typically best to use that title. However, some authors prefer to use different or modified titles.

When defining the title of a script publication:

- Use text that hints at the script's purpose or functionality. A meaningful title helps users understand and search for the publication.
- Use English text only. If the script is [public](#public), it is available to the *global* TradingView community. To help ensure the script is understandable, English is required by our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/) because it is the most common language used for international communication.
- Include only standard 7-bit ASCII characters to ensure readability and searchability. Do not include emoji or other special characters in this text.
- Avoid using all capital letters in the text, except for abbreviations such as "RSI", "EMA", etc. Text with whole words written in ALL CAPS is distracting for users.
- Do not include misleading or unsubstantiated statements about the script (e.g., "90% win rate").
- Do not include website references, social media handles, or other forms of advertisement.

The second text field determines the publication's *description*. The toolbar at the top contains several options that insert *markup tags* into the field for adding text formats, Pine code blocks, lists, and more. The script page displays the complete, parsed text from this field below the published chart or strategy report:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Preparing-a-publication-Title-and-description-2.CBDKLO8I_Z1ciHWF.png)

Most of the markup for publication descriptions requires surrounding raw text with an *opening tag* (e.g., `[b]`) and a matching *closing tag* with a forward slash (e.g., `[/b]`). Some tags also require additional syntax. Here, we list the available tags and explain how they work:

- The `[b][/b]`, `[i][/i]`, and `[s][/s]` tag pairs respectively apply **bold**, *italic*, and strikethrough formatting to the enclosed text.
- The `[pine][/pine]` tags format the enclosed multi-line text as a Pine code block with syntax highlighting on a new line.
- The `[list][/list]` tags create a bulleted list. Each line between these tags that starts with the special `[*]` tag defines a separate bullet. To create a *numbered* list, use `[list=1]` as the *opening tag*.
- The `[quote][/quote]` tags format the enclosed multi-line text as a *block quotation*.
- The `[url=][/url]` tags create a hyperlink to a specified URL. For example, `[url=https://www.tradingview.com/]myLink[/url]` formats the text "myLink" as a link to TradingView's home page. Use these tags to create links to relevant TradingView pages and standard reference materials. Avoid linking to social media or other websites, as our [House Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/house-rules/) forbid advertising in publications.
- The `[image][/image]` tags render a *chart image* from an enclosed *URL* for either a [snapshot](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000482537-how-do-i-take-a-snapshot-and-share-it-afterwards/) or an idea publication. These tags are *optional*, as publications can render images from snapshot and idea URLs automatically. Before taking a snapshot, [prepare the chart](#chart) for readability, as you would for a publication's chart.
- The `$` character adds a hyperlink to a specific symbol's *overview page* when it precedes a valid *symbol* or *ticker identifier*. For example, `$AMEX:SPY` creates a link to the [SPY symbol overview](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/).

Writing a helpful description is a **critical step** in the script publishing process, as users rely on the provided information to understand a published script. Below, we list a few helpful recommendations for preparing descriptions based on some of the key criteria outlined in our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/):

- Include relevant, self-contained details that help users understand the script's purpose, how it works, how to use it, and why it is original, regardless of the intended [visibility type](#visibility-types). Even if the publication is [open-source](#open), the description should cover this information because not all users understand a script by reading its Pine Script™ code. Furthermore, an informative description helps users verify that the script works as intended.
- If the publication is closed-source ([protected](#protected) or [invite-only](#invite-only)), include accurate details about the script's *unique qualities* that require hiding the source code. Closed-source scripts that match the behaviors of open-source scripts *do not* benefit our community.
- Do not make unsubstantiated statements about the script's capabilities or performance. If the text contains claims about the script, it should include details substantiating them to avoid misleading traders.
- If the text contains emoji or other non-ASCII characters, ensure it uses them *sparingly* to maintain readability. Likewise, avoid using all capital letters throughout the text because it reduces readability.
- The description *can* include languages other than English. However, the text should *begin* with an English explanation to help users in *different regions* understand the publication. Additionally, if the source code does not use English for input titles or other user interface text, the description should contain English translations of those elements.

### [Publication settings](https://www.tradingview.com#publication-settings)

The *second* page of the "Publish script" window is where authors specify a script publication's settings and search tags. This page is accessible only after adding a [title and description](#title-and-description) for the script on the previous page and selecting the "Continue" button:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Preparing-a-publication-Publication-settings-1.BopRWx7F_1tELg7.png)

The two fields at the top of the page specify the script's [privacy](#privacy-types) and [visibility](#visibility-types) types. Ensure both fields use the correct options, as these settings **cannot** change after the script is published.

Note that setting the publication's visibility type to [invite-only](#invite-only) reveals an additional *"Author's instructions"* field, which cannot remain empty. This field is where vendors provide necessary information for users to *request access* to their script, such as direct contact details and links to instructional pages. The contents of this field will appear below the description on the invite-only script page:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Preparing-a-publication-Publication-settings-2.zrEdY71P_Z1EXmJb.png)

The remaining input fields on this page provide options to assign *tags* (keywords) to the publication for discoverability. The "Category" field contains a menu where the author can select up to *three* preset category tags for the publication. If the script is [public](#public), users can search the specified categories to discover it:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Preparing-a-publication-Publication-settings-3.CC7fol2N_WRQHi.png)

The publication can also include *custom*, non-preset search tags for additional discoverability. To add custom tags to the publication, select the "Show more" option, then enter a list of searchable keywords in the "Tags" field:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Preparing-a-publication-Publication-settings-4.GJNmetqs_1PisUf.png)

## [Publishing and editing](https://www.tradingview.com#publishing-and-editing)

After following all necessary steps to [prepare](#preparing-a-publication) a script publication, including fine-tuning the source code, cleaning the chart, and adding a helpful [title and description](#title-and-description), select the "Publish…" button at the bottom of the last page of the "Publish script" window to publish the script.

If the publication's [privacy type](#privacy-types) is set to [public](#public), there is a checkbox above the "Publish…" button, which the author must select before they can create the publication. This checkbox confirms awareness of the [House Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/house-rules/) and the consequence of the script becoming *hidden* from the community if it does not follow them:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Publishing-and-editing-1.g0aukk4n_Z1YW1w1.png)

When the script is published, the "Publish script" window closes automatically, and TradingView opens the new publication's script page. The page includes "Edit" and "Delete" buttons in the top-right corner. If the script is public, these buttons are available for only *15 minutes*. If private, they are *always* available.

Selecting the "Edit" button opens the "Edit script" window, where the author can change the title, description, and search tags:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Publishing-and-editing-2.B4MkWBGt_1kk58x.png)

Note that:

- The "Privacy settings" and "Visibility" fields on the second page of this window are **not** editable.
- The "Edit script" window does **not** provide options to edit the published source code, chart, or strategy report. To change these details, publish a [script update](#script-updates).

## [Script updates](https://www.tradingview.com#script-updates)

Authors can *update* their [public](#public) or [private](#private) scripts over time to add new features, fix bugs, optimize performance, etc. To publish an update to an existing script, confirm that the new source code differs from the code in the last published version. Then, add the updated script to the chart and select the "Publish…" option in the top-right of the Pine Editor to open the "Publish script" window.

After opening the window, select the "Update existing script" option at the top of the first page:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-updates-1.D8yrCVTG_26fo9x.png)

In this publishing mode, the first text field specifies the *existing* script to update, **not** the title of a new publication. Enter the existing publication's title in the field or select the title from the available options in the dropdown menu:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-updates-2.5kB1ziBB_QDCNb.png)

Below the title field is a checkbox specifying whether the update will affect the publication's chart. If unchecked (default), the script page will copy the author's *current chart* to showcase the changes. If checked, the publication will continue using its *existing* chart display:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-updates-3.BRqtoGMg_vI6Pa.png)

The text field below the checkbox is where the author explains the *changes* made to the script. The publication will display the parsed text from this field beneath the description as dated *release notes* on the script page. The contents of this field **do not** modify the publication's original description and are displayed *in addition* to it:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-updates-4.Ddgh4wVF_ZtYLjK.png)

When publishing release notes, prepare them similarly to the [description](#title-and-description). Provide self-contained information allowing users to understand the changes included in the update, how they impact the script's functionality, and what benefits the changes provide over the previous version.

The bottom of the page contains an expandable *difference checker*, which displays a side-by-side or inline comparison between the new source code and the last published version. We recommend inspecting and confirming the code differences *before* publishing an update, because all updates are preserved in the script's *version history*:

![image](images/Publishing-scripts-Script-updates-5.BenrpOqA_lzlam.png)

After confirming the details on the first page of the "Publish script" window, select "Continue" to move to the final page, then select the "Publish new version" button at the bottom to finalize the script update.

Note that:

- The "Privacy settings" and "Visibility" fields appear grayed out on the last page of the window for script updates because authors **cannot** change these settings for existing script publications.

## [Tips](https://www.tradingview.com#tips)

Use the following tips and our recommendations in the [Preparing a publication](#preparing-a-publication) section above to create helpful, compliant script publications.

### [Private drafts](https://www.tradingview.com#private-drafts)

New script authors occasionally overlook the importance of reviewing their content before sharing it publicly, leading to unintentional errors in their published script descriptions, such as typos, incorrect statements, or House Rule violations.

The title and description of a [public](#public) script are editable for only 15 minutes. After that time, the content becomes **final**. If the published text contains mistakes, the author **cannot**[edit](#publishing-and-editing) or [update](#script-updates) the publication to fix them.

In contrast, [private](#private) scripts are always editable, making them valuable tools for *drafting* public script releases. Private drafts help authors avoid uncaught mistakes in their public versions and ensure quality for script users. Therefore, we strongly recommend starting *every* script publication with a private draft.

When using private publications as drafts for public releases, follow this simple process:

1. [Prepare](#preparing-a-publication) the draft publication's content as you would for a public script, but set the "Privacy settings" field to "Private" on the last page of the "Publish script" window.
2. Check the private draft's script widget and script page to verify whether the publication's content appears as intended. If there are mistakes in the draft's source code, chart, or strategy report, fix them by publishing an [update](#script-updates). To fix errors in the draft's title or description, select the "Edit" option on the script page and add the corrected text to the appropriate field.
3. After validating the draft, open the "Edit script" window and copy the raw text from the description field.
4. Prepare a new, public script publication using the updated source code and verified description text.
5. After publishing the public version, you can delete the private draft using the "Delete" option at the top-right of its script page.

### [House Rules](https://www.tradingview.com#house-rules)

Many traders use [public](#public) scripts in their analysis to reinforce trade decisions. Likewise, many programmers learn from public scripts and use published [libraries](#libraries) in their Pine projects. New and experienced users alike should be able to rely on the script publications from our community for helpful content and original, potentially beneficial tools.

Our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/) establish the core criteria for publishing scripts on TradingView, and our [Vendor Requirements](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000549951-vendor-requirements/) define additional criteria for [vendors](#invite-only). The script moderators curate the [Community scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/) based on these rules and our [House Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/house-rules/). If a publication does not meet these criteria, it becomes *hidden*, and our moderators send the author a message explaining the issues that need correction. The author can then [prepare](#preparing-a-publication) a *new publication* with the necessary corrections if they want to share their script publicly.

We recommend all authors review and understand our rules and verify a script publication's compliance *before* publishing it. Below, we list a few simple tips:

**Publish original content**

Publish a script publicly if you believe it is original and might benefit the community. Avoid rehashing, mimicking, or copying existing scripts or other public domain code. Likewise, avoid publishing scripts that combine available indicators or other code without a clear purpose. In other words, aim to provide a helpful tool for the community based on *your* unique interests and expertise.

**Reuse code responsibly**

Authors can publish scripts that reuse open-source code from other publications. However, they must meet the "Open-source reuse" criteria in our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/), which take precedence over all open-source licenses. These criteria include crediting the original author, making meaningful improvements to the code, and sharing the code [open-source](#open) unless the original author grants *explicit permission* to publish it closed-source.

**Use a clear chart**

A script publication's chart showcases the script's visual outputs to help users understand how it works. This display is not for demonstrating complex charting setups with multiple scripts or drawing tools. If the chart of a published script contains unnecessary scripts or drawings, it will not add clarity for users, and it can potentially mislead them.

Therefore, when publishing a public script, ensure the chart only includes what is *necessary* to demonstrate its outputs and behaviors. See the "Chart" section of our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/) to understand our chart criteria, and [this portion](#chart) of the [Preparing a publication](#preparing-a-publication) section above for detailed recommendations.

**Provide helpful documentation**

Similar to how users rely on our documentation to understand Pine, users rely on the documentation in an author's publications to understand their scripts. When a script publication does not include a helpful description that explains the script's workings and how to use it, users often struggle to understand and use it effectively. Therefore, when sharing a script publicly, include a clear description explaining everything users need to know about it and its use.

See the "Description" and "Language" sections of our [Script Publishing Rules](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000590599-script-publishing-rules/) to understand the criteria for helpful script descriptions. The [Title and description](#title-and-description) section above provides detailed recommendations based on these criteria.

For examples of compliant script descriptions, refer to the publications featured in our [Editors' picks](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/editors-picks/). To see examples of our recommended description format, refer to the publications from the [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/u/TradingView/#published-scripts) and [PineCoders](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/#published-scripts) accounts.

#### Profiling and optimization](#profiling-and-optimization)[Next

#### Limitations](#limitations)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Writing scripts](#style-guide)/Limitations

# [Limitations](https://www.tradingview.com#limitations)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

As is mentioned in our [Welcome](#welcome) page:

*Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we
must impose limits in order to share these resources fairly among our
users. We strive to set as few limits as possible, but will of course
have to implement as many as needed for the platform to run smoothly.
Limitations apply to the amount of data requested from additional
symbols, execution time, memory usage and script size.*

If you develop complex scripts using Pine Script™, sooner or later you
will run into some of the limitations we impose. This section provides
you with an overview of the limitations that you may encounter. There
are currently no means for Pine Script™ programmers to get data on the
resources consumed by their scripts. We hope this will change in the
future.

In the meantime, when you are considering large projects, it is safest
to make a proof of concept in order to assess the probability of your
script running into limitations later in your project.

Below, we describe the limits imposed in the Pine Script™ environment.

## [Time](https://www.tradingview.com#time)

### [Script compilation](https://www.tradingview.com#script-compilation)

Scripts must compile before they are executed on charts. Compilation
occurs when you save a script from the Pine Editor or when you add a
script to the chart. A two-minute limit is imposed on compilation time,
which will depend on the size and complexity of your script, and whether
or not a cached version of a previous compilation is available. When a
compile exceeds the two-minute limit, a warning is issued. Heed that
warning by shortening your script because after three consecutives
warnings a one-hour ban on compilation attempts is enforced. The first
thing to consider when optimizing code is to avoid repetitions by using
functions to encapsulate oft-used segments, and call functions instead
of repeating code.

### [Script execution](https://www.tradingview.com#script-execution)

Once a script is compiled it can be executed. See the
[Events triggering the execution of a script](#events-triggering-the-execution-of-a-script) for a list of the events triggering the execution of a
script. The time allotted for the script to execute on all bars of a
dataset varies with account types. The limit is 20 seconds for basic
accounts, 40 for others.

### [Loop execution](https://www.tradingview.com#loop-execution)

The execution time for any loop on any single bar is limited to 500
milliseconds. The outer loop of embedded loops counts as one loop, so it
will time out first. Keep in mind that even though a loop may execute
under the 500 ms time limit on a given bar, the time it takes to execute
on all the dataset's bars may nonetheless cause your script to exceed
the total execution time limit. For example, the limit on total
execution time will make it impossible for you script to execute a 400
ms loop on each bar of a 20,000-bar dataset because your script would
then need 8000 seconds to execute.

## [Chart visuals](https://www.tradingview.com#chart-visuals)

### [Plot limits](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-limits)

A maximum of 64 plot counts are allowed per script. The functions that
generate plot counts are:

- [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot)
- [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow)
- [plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotbar)
- [plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
- [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar)
- [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape)
- [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition)
- [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor)
- [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill),
  but only if its `color` is of the
  [series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_series)
  form.

The following functions do not generate plot counts:

- [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline)
- [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line%7Bdot%7Dnew)
- [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
- [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dnew)
- [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)

One function call can generate up to seven plot counts, depending on the
function and how it is called. When your script exceeds the maximum of
64 plot counts, the runtime error message will display the plot count
generated by your script. Once you reach that point, you can determine
how many plot counts a function call generates by commenting it out in a
script. As long as your script still throws an error, you will be able
to see how the actual plot count decreases after you have commented out
a line.

The following example shows different function calls and the number of
plot counts each one will generate:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plot count example")

bool isUp = close > open
color isUpColor = isUp ? color.green : color.red
bool isDn = not isUp
color isDnColor = isDn ? color.red : color.green

// Uses one plot count each.
p1 = plot(close, color = color.white)
p2 = plot(open, color = na)

// Uses two plot counts for the `close` and `color` series.
plot(close, color = isUpColor)

// Uses one plot count for the `close` series.
plotarrow(close, colorup = color.green, colordown = color.red)

// Uses two plot counts for the `close` and `colorup` series.
plotarrow(close, colorup = isUpColor)

// Uses three plot counts for the `close`, `colorup`, and the `colordown` series.
plotarrow(close - open, colorup = isUpColor, colordown = isDnColor)

// Uses four plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` series.
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = color.white)

// Uses five plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `color` series.
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor)

// Uses four plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = color.white, wickcolor = color.white, bordercolor = color.purple)

// Uses five plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `color` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor, wickcolor = color.white, bordercolor = color.purple)

// Uses six plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `color`, and `wickcolor` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor, wickcolor = isUpColor , bordercolor = color.purple)

// Uses seven plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `color`, `wickcolor`, and `bordercolor` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor, wickcolor = isUpColor , bordercolor = isUp ? color.lime : color.maroon)

// Uses one plot count for the `close` series.
plotchar(close, color = color.white, text = "|", textcolor = color.white)

// Uses two plot counts for the `close`` and `color` series.
plotchar(close, color = isUpColor, text = "—", textcolor = color.white)

// Uses three plot counts for the `close`, `color`, and `textcolor` series.
plotchar(close, color = isUpColor, text = "O", textcolor = isUp ? color.yellow : color.white)

// Uses one plot count for the `close` series.
plotshape(close, color = color.white, textcolor = color.white)

// Uses two plot counts for the `close` and `color` series.
plotshape(close, color = isUpColor, textcolor = color.white)

// Uses three plot counts for the `close`, `color`, and `textcolor` series.
plotshape(close, color = isUpColor, textcolor = isUp ? color.yellow : color.white)

// Uses one plot count.
alertcondition(close > open, "close > open", "Up bar alert")

// Uses one plot count.
bgcolor(isUp ? color.yellow : color.white)

// Uses one plot count for the `color` series.
fill(p1, p2, color = isUpColor)
```

This example generates a plot count of 56. If we were to add two more
instances of the last call to
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle),
the script would throw an error stating that the script now uses 70 plot
counts, as each additional call to
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotcandle)
generates seven plot counts, and 56 + (7 * 2) is 70.

### [Line, box, polyline, and label limits](https://www.tradingview.com#line-box-polyline-and-label-limits)

Contrary to [plots](#plots), which can
cover the chart's entire dataset, scripts will only show the last 50
[lines](#lines),
[boxes](#boxes),
[polylines](#polylines),
and [labels](#labels) on
the chart by default. One can increase the maximum number for each of
these
[drawing types](#drawing-types) via the `max_lines_count`, `max_boxes_count`,
`max_polylines_count`, and `max_labels_count` parameters of the
script's
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator)
or
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
declaration statement. The maximum number of
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_line),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_box),
and
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
IDs is 500, and the maximum number of
[polyline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_polyline)
IDs is 100.

In this example, we set the maximum number of recent labels shown on the
chart to 100:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Label limits example", max_labels_count = 100, overlay = true)
label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
```

It's important to note when setting any of a drawing object's
properties to
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) that
its ID still exists and thus contributes to a script's drawing totals.
To demonstrate this behavior, the following script draws a "Buy" and
"Sell"
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label)
on each bar, with `x` values determined by the `longCondition` and
`shortCondition` variables.

The "Buy" label's `x` value is
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) when
the bar index is even, and the "Sell" label's `x` value is
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) when
the bar index is odd. Although the `max_labels_count` is 10 in this
example, we can see that the script displays fewer than 10
[labels](#labels) on the
chart since the ones with
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)
values also count toward the total:

![image](images/Limitations-LabelsWithNa-1.BrXz3MoQ_2600rs.png)

```
//@version=6

// Approximate maximum number of label drawings
MAX_LABELS = 10

indicator("labels with na", overlay = false, max_labels_count = MAX_LABELS)

// Add background color for the last MAX_LABELS bars.
bgcolor(bar_index > last_bar_index - MAX_LABELS ? color.new(color.green, 80) : na)

longCondition =  bar_index % 2 != 0
shortCondition = bar_index % 2 == 0

// Add "Buy" and "Sell" labels on each new bar.
label.new(longCondition ? bar_index : na,  0, text = "Buy", color = color.new(color.green, 0), style = label.style_label_up)
label.new(shortCondition ? bar_index : na, 0, text = "Sell", color = color.new(color.red, 0), style = label.style_label_down)

plot(longCondition  ? 1 : 0)
plot(shortCondition ? 1 : 0)
```

To display the desired number of labels, we must eliminate label
drawings we don't want to show rather than setting their properties to
[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na). The
example below uses an
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
structure to conditionally draw the "Buy" and "Sell" labels,
preventing the script from creating new label IDs when it isn't
necessary:

![image](images/Limitations-LabelsWithNa-2.CiofVUZK_2oXzgA.png)

```
//@version=6

// Approximate maximum number of label drawings
MAX_LABELS = 10

indicator("conditional labels", overlay = false, max_labels_count = MAX_LABELS)

// Add background color for the last MAX_LABELS bars.
bgcolor(bar_index > last_bar_index - MAX_LABELS ? color.new(color.green, 80) : na)

longCondition =  bar_index % 2 != 0
shortCondition = bar_index % 2 == 0

// Add a "Buy" label when `longCondition` is true.
if longCondition
    label.new(bar_index,  0, text = "Buy", color = color.new(color.green, 0), style = label.style_label_up)
// Add a "Sell" label when `shortCondition` is true.
if shortCondition
    label.new(bar_index, 0, text = "Sell", color = color.new(color.red, 0), style = label.style_label_down)

plot(longCondition  ? 1 : 0)
plot(shortCondition ? 1 : 0)
```

### [Table limits](https://www.tradingview.com#table-limits)

Scripts can display a maximum of nine
[tables](#tables) on the chart, one
for each of the possible locations:
[position.bottom_center](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dbottom_center),
[position.bottom_left](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dbottom_left),
[position.bottom_right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dbottom_right),
[position.middle_center](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dmiddle_center),
[position.middle_left](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dmiddle_left),
[position.middle_right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dmiddle_right),
[position.top_center](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dtop_center),
[position.top_left](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dtop_left),
and
[position.top_right](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_position%7Bdot%7Dtop_right).
When attempting to place two tables in the same location, only the
newest instance will show on the chart.

## [`request.*()` calls](https://www.tradingview.com#request-calls)

### [Number of calls](https://www.tradingview.com#number-of-calls)

A script can use up to 40 *unique* calls to the functions in the `request.*()` namespace. A subsequent call to the same `request.*()` function with the same arguments is not unique. This limitation applies when using any `request.*()` functions, including:

- [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
- [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
- [request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.currency_rate)
- [request.dividends()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.dividends)
- [request.splits()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.splits)
- [request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings)
- [request.quandl()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.quandl)
- [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial)
- [request.economic()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.economic)
- [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.seed)

When a script executes two or more identical `request.*()` function calls, only the *first* call counts toward this limit. The repeated calls do not count because they *reuse* the data from the first call rather than executing a redundant request. Note that when a script imports [library](#libraries) functions containing `request.*()` calls within their scopes, those calls **do** count toward this limit, even if the script already calls the same `request.*()` function with the same arguments in its main scope.

The script below calls [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) with the same arguments 50 times within a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop. Although the script contains more than 40 `request.*()` calls, it *does not* raise an error because each call is **identical**. In this case, it reuses the data from the first iteration's [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call for the repeated calls on all subsequent iterations:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`request.*()` call limit demo")

//@variable The sum of values requested from all `request.security()` calls.
float reqSum = 0.0

// Call `request.security()` 50 times within a loop. 
// More than 40 `request.*()` calls occur, but each call is identical. Redundant calls do not count toward the limit. 
for i = 1 to 50
    reqSum += request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close)

plot(reqSum)
```

Here, we modified the above script to call [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) with a different `timeframe` argument on each iteration, meaning all 50 calls are now **unique**. This time, the script will reach the `request.*()` call limit while executing the loop and raise a runtime error because it requests a *distinct* dataset on each iteration:

```
//@version=6
indicator("`request.*()` call limit demo")

//@variable The sum of values requested from all `request.security()` calls.
float reqSum = 0.0

// Call `request.security()` 50 times within a loop with different `timeframe` arguments. 
// This loop causes a runtime error when `i == 41` because each iteration executes a unique request.
for i = 1 to 50
    reqSum += request.security(syminfo.tickerid, str.tostring(i), close)

plot(reqSum)
```

Note that:

- These example scripts can call [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) within a loop and allow "series string" `timeframe` arguments because Pine v6 scripts enable dynamic requests by default. See [this section](#dynamic-requests) of the [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page for more information.

### [Intrabars](https://www.tradingview.com#intrabars)

Scripts can retrieve up to the most recent 200,000 *intrabars*
(lower-timeframe bars) via the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) or [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) functions, depending on the user's plan:

- All non-professional plans — Basic, Essential, Plus, and Premium — can request up to 100K bars of data.
- Expert plans have access to 125K bars of data.
- Ultimate plans can request 200K lower timeframe bars.

The `request.*()` functions limit requested data via the `calc_bars_count` parameter. If this parameter is not specified, the default is used, which is 100,000 bars. If the plan permits more, this limit can be increased by passing a greater value.

The number of bars on the chart's timeframe covered by 100,000
intrabars varies with the number of intrabars each chart bar contains.
For example, requesting data from the 1-minute timeframe while running
the script on a 60-minute chart means each chart bar can contain up to
60 intrabars. In this case, the minimum number of chart bars covered by
the intrabar request is 1,666, as 100,000 / 60 = 1,666.67. It's
important to note, however, that a provider may not report data for
*every* minute within an hour. Therefore, such a request may cover more
chart bars, depending on the available data.

### [Tuple element limit](https://www.tradingview.com#tuple-element-limit)

All the `request.*()` function calls in a script taken together cannot
return more than 127 tuple elements. When the combined tuple size of all
`request.*()` calls will exceed 127 elements, one can instead utilize
[user-defined types (UDTs)](#user-defined-types) to request a greater number of values.

The example below outlines this limitation and the way to work around
it. The first
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
call represents using a tuple with 128 elements as the `expression`
argument. Since the number of elements is greater than 127, it would
result in an error.

To avoid the error, we can use those same values as *fields* within an
[object](#objects) of a
[UDT](#user-defined-types)
and pass its ID to the `expression` instead:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Tuple element limit")

s1 = close
s2 = close * 2
...
s128 = close * 128

// Causes an error. 
[v1, v2, v3, ..., v128] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", [s1, s2, s3, ..., s128])

// Works fine:
type myType
    float v1
    float v2
    float v3
    ...
    float v128

myObj = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", myType.new(s1, s2, s3, ..., s128))
```

Note that:

- This example outlines a scenario where the script tries to
  evaluate 128 tuple elements in a single
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  call. The same limitation applies if we were to split the tuple
  request across *multiple* calls. For example, two
  [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security)
  calls that each retrieve a tuple with 64 elements will also
  cause an error.

## [Script size and memory](https://www.tradingview.com#script-size-and-memory)

### [Compiled tokens](https://www.tradingview.com#compiled-tokens)

Before the execution of a script, the compiler translates it into a
tokenized *Intermediate Language* (IL). Using an IL allows Pine Script™
to accommodate larger scripts by applying various memory and performance
optimizations. The compiler determines the size of a script based on the
*number of tokens* in its IL form, **not** the number of characters or
lines in the code viewable in the Pine Editor.

The compiled form of each indicator, strategy, and library script is
limited to 80,000 tokens. When a script imports libraries, the total
number of tokens from all imported libraries cannot exceed 1 million.
There is no way to inspect a script's compiled form, nor its IL token
count. As such, you will only know your script exceeds the size limit
when the compiler reaches it.

In most cases, a script's compiled size will likely not reach the
limit. However, if a compiled script does reach the token limit, the
most effective ways to decrease compiled tokens are to reduce repetitive
code, encapsulate redundant calls within functions, and utilize
[libraries](#libraries) when possible.

It's important to note that the compilation process omits any *unused*
variables, functions, types, etc. from the final IL form, where
"unused" refers to anything that *does not* affect the script's
outputs. This optimization prevents superfluous elements in the code
from contributing to the script's IL token count.

For example, the script below declares a
[user-defined type](#user-defined-types) and a
[user-defined method](#user-defined-methods) and defines a sequence of calls using them:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
plot(close)

type myType
    float field = 10.0

method m(array<myType> a, myType v) =>
    a.push(v)

var arr = array.new<myType>()
arr.push(myType.new(25))
arr.m(myType.new())
```

Despite the inclusion of [array.new<myType>()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.new%3Ctype%3E),
`myType.new()`, and `arr.m()` calls in the script, the only thing
actually **output** by the script is `plot(close)`. The rest of the code
does not affect the output. Therefore, the compiled form of this script
will have the *same* number of tokens as:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
plot(close)
```

### [Variables per scope](https://www.tradingview.com#variables-per-scope)

Scripts can contain up to 1,000 variables in each of its scopes. Pine
scripts always contain one global scope, represented by non-indented
code, and they may contain zero or more local scopes. Local scopes are
sections of indented code representing procedures executed within
[functions](#user-defined-functions) and
[methods](#user-defined-methods), as well as
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if),
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch),
[for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for),
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in),
and
[while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while)
structures, which allow for one or more local blocks. Each local block
counts as one local scope.

The branches of a conditional expression using the
[?:](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%7Bquestion%7D%7Bcolon%7D)
ternary operator do not count as local blocks.

### [Compilation request size](https://www.tradingview.com#compilation-request-size)

The size of the compilation request for a script cannot exceed 5MB. The compilation request is all of the information that is sent to the compiler. This information comprises the script itself and any libraries the script imports.

Unlike the limit for compiled tokens, the request size limit includes unused parts of code. This is because the script is not compiled yet, so any unused code has not yet been optimized out.

To reduce the compilation request size, you can:

- Reduce the size of the script by optimizing the code.
- Reduce the number of script inputs (script inputs are counted separately).
- Remove any imported libraries that are not needed.
- Use smaller libraries. The entire library is sent for compilation, regardless of which functions are called.

### [Collections](https://www.tradingview.com#collections)

Pine Script™ collections ([arrays](#arrays), [matrices](#matrices),
and [maps](#maps)) can have a maximum
of 100,000 elements. Each key-value pair in a map contains two elements,
meaning [maps](#maps) can contain a
maximum of 50,000 key-value pairs.

## [Other limitations](https://www.tradingview.com#other-limitations)

### [Maximum bars back](https://www.tradingview.com#maximum-bars-back)

References to past values using the
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_op_%5B%5D)
history-referencing operator are dependent on the size of the historical
buffer maintained by the Pine Script™ runtime, which is limited to a
maximum of 5000 bars. [This Help Center
page](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000587849)
discusses the historical buffer and how to change its size using either
the `max_bars_back` parameter or the
[max_bars_back()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back)
function.

### [Maximum bars forward](https://www.tradingview.com#maximum-bars-forward)

When positioning drawings using `xloc.bar_index`, it is possible to use
bar index values greater than that of the current bar as *x*
coordinates. A maximum of 500 bars in the future can be referenced.

This example shows how we use the [maxval] parameter in our
[input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dint)
function call to cap the user-defined number of bars forward we draw a
projection line so that it never exceeds the limit:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Max bars forward example", overlay = true)

// This function draws a `line` using bar index x-coordinates.
drawLine(bar1, y1, bar2, y2) =>
    // Only execute this code on the last bar.
    if barstate.islast
        // Create the line only the first time this function is executed on the last bar.
        var line lin = line.new(bar1, y1, bar2, y2, xloc.bar_index)
        // Change the line's properties on all script executions on the last bar.
        line.set_xy1(lin, bar1, y1)
        line.set_xy2(lin, bar2, y2)

// Input determining how many bars forward we draw the `line`.
int forwardBarsInput = input.int(10, "Forward Bars to Display", minval = 1, maxval = 500)

// Calculate the line's left and right points.
int   leftBar  = bar_index[2]
float leftY    = high[2]
int   rightBar = leftBar + forwardBarsInput
float rightY   = leftY + (ta.change(high)[1] * forwardBarsInput)

// This function call is executed on all bars, but it only draws the `line` on the last bar.
drawLine(leftBar, leftY, rightBar, rightY)
```

### [Chart bars](https://www.tradingview.com#chart-bars)

The number of bars appearing on charts is dependent on the amount of
historical data available for the chart's symbol and timeframe, and on
the type of account you hold. When the required historical date is
available, the minimum number of chart bars is:

- 40000 historical bars for the Ultimate plan.
- 25000 historical bars for the Expert plan.
- 20000 historical bars for the Premium plan.
- 10000 historical bars for Essential and Plus plans.
- 5000 historical bars for other plans.

### [Trade orders in backtesting](https://www.tradingview.com#trade-orders-in-backtesting)

A script can place a maximum of 9000 orders when backtesting strategies. Once it reaches that limit, the earlier orders are *trimmed* to store the information of new orders. Programmers can use the [strategy.closedtrades.first_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.closedtrades.first_index) variable to reference the index of the earliest untrimmed trade.

When using Deep Backtesting, the order limit is 1,000,000.

# [FAQ](https://www.tradingview.com#faq)

## [Get real OHLC price on a Heikin Ashi chart](https://www.tradingview.com#get-real-ohlc-price-on-a-heikin-ashi-chart)

Suppose, we have a Heikin Ashi chart (or Renko, Kagi, PriceBreak etc)
and we've added a Pine script on it:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Visible OHLC", overlay=true)
c = close
plot(c)
```

You may see that variable `c` is a Heikin Ashi *close* price which is
not the same as real OHLC price. Because `close` built-in variable is
always a value that corresponds to a visible bar (or candle) on the
chart.

So, how do we get the real OHLC prices in Pine Script™ code, if current
chart type is non-standard? We should use `request.security` function in
combination with `ticker.new` function. Here is an example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Real OHLC", overlay = true)
t = ticker.new(syminfo.prefix, syminfo.ticker)
realC = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close)
plot(realC)
```

In a similar way we may get other OHLC prices: *open*, *high* and *low*.

## [Get non-standard OHLC values on a standard chart](https://www.tradingview.com#get-non-standard-ohlc-values-on-a-standard-chart)

Backtesting on non-standard chart types (e.g. Heikin Ashi or Renko) is
not recommended because the bars on these kinds of charts do not
represent real price movement that you would encounter while trading. If
you want your strategy to enter and exit on real prices but still use
Heikin Ashi-based signals, you can use the same method to get Heikin
Ashi values on a regular candlestick chart:

```
//@version=6
strategy("BarUpDn Strategy", overlay = true, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value = 10)
maxIdLossPcntInput = input.float(1, "Max Intraday Loss(%)")
strategy.risk.max_intraday_loss(maxIdLossPcntInput, strategy.percent_of_equity)
needTrade() => close > open and open > close[1] ? 1 : close < open and open < close[1] ? -1 : 0
trade = request.security(ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid), timeframe.period, needTrade())
if trade == 1
    strategy.entry("BarUp", strategy.long)
if trade == -1
    strategy.entry("BarDn", strategy.short)
```

## [Plot arrows on the chart](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-arrows-on-the-chart)

You may use plotshape with style `shape.arrowup` and `shape.arrowdown`:

```
//@version=6
indicator('Ex 1', overlay = true)
condition = close >= open
plotshape(condition, color = color.lime, style = shape.arrowup, text = "Buy")
plotshape(not condition, color = color.red, style = shape.arrowdown, text = "Sell")
```

![image](images/Buy_sell_chart1.CyNH3Z6U_2g4dui.png)

You may use the `plotchar` function with any unicode character:

```
//@version=6
indicator('buy/sell arrows', overlay = true)
condition = close >= open
plotchar(not condition, char='↓', color = color.lime, text = "Buy")
plotchar(condition, char='↑', location = location.belowbar, color = color.red, text = "Sell")
```

## [Plot a dynamic horizontal line](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-a-dynamic-horizontal-line)

There is the function `hline` in Pine Script™, but it is limited to only
plot a constant value. Here is a simple script with a workaround to plot
a changing hline:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Horizontal line", overlay = true)
plot(close[10], trackprice = true, offset = -9999)
// `trackprice = true` plots horizontal line on close[10]
// `offset = -9999` hides the plot
plot(close, color = #FFFFFFFF)  // forces display
```

## [Plot a vertical line on condition](https://www.tradingview.com#plot-a-vertical-line-on-condition)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Vertical line", overlay = true, scale = scale.none)
// scale.none means do not resize the chart to fit this plot
// if the bar being evaluated is the last baron the chart (the most recent bar), then cond is true
cond = barstate.islast
// when cond is true, plot a histogram with a line with height value of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000.00
// (10 to the power of 20)
// when cond is false, plot no numeric value (nothing is plotted)
// use the style of histogram, a vertical bar
plot(cond ? 10e20 : na, style = plot.style_histogram)
```

## [Access the previous value](https://www.tradingview.com#access-the-previous-value)

```
//@version=6
//...
s = 0.0
s := nz(s[1]) // Accessing previous values
if (condition)
    s := s + 1
```

# [Alerts](https://www.tradingview.com#alerts)

## [How do I make an alert available from my script?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-make-an-alert-available-from-my-script)

In indicator scripts, there are two ways to define triggers for [alerts](#alerts):

- Using the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function
- Using the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function

In strategy scripts, there are also two ways to define alert triggers:

- Using the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function
- Using [order fill events](#order-fill-events)

These methods make alert triggers available but do not *create* alerts directly. Users must create alerts using a script's alert triggers by selecting the appropriate trigger in the "Condition" dropdown of the "Create Alert" dialog box.

Programmers can define multiple alert triggers of one or more types in a script.

## [How are the types of alerts different?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-are-the-types-of-alerts-different)

### [Usability](https://www.tradingview.com#usability)

Any script can include calls to the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) and [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) functions within their code. However, [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) calls have no effect unless the script is an *indicator*. [Libraries](#libraries) can *export* functions containing [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) calls, but they cannot issue alert triggers directly.

[Order fill](#order-fill-events) alert triggers are available only from [strategies](#strategies).

### [Options for creating alerts](https://www.tradingview.com#options-for-creating-alerts)

Each [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) call in an indicator script defines one distinct trigger and one corresponding option in the "Condition" dropdown menu of the "Create Alert" dialog box. If the user wants multiple alerts, they must create each one *separately*.

By contrast, if a script includes one or more [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function calls, only *one* option appears in the "Condition" dropdown menu, titled "Any alert() function call". Selecting this option creates a *single alert* that activates based on the occurrences of *any* executed [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call.

Similarly, for strategy scripts, the "Order fills and and alert() function calls" or "Order fills only" option in the "Condition" dropdown menu creates an alert that fires when *any*[order fill event](#order-fill-events) occurs.

### [How alerts activate](https://www.tradingview.com#how-alerts-activate)

The [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function operates exclusively in an indicator's [global scope](#what-does-scope-mean). Scripts cannot include calls to this function within any *local block*, such as the *indented* code within an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) structure. The function triggers an alert when its specified `condition` is `true`. Users can set the allowed *frequency* of the alert trigger using the "Frequency" field in the "Create Alert" dialog box.

The [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function has no `condition` parameter. Scripts trigger the alerts on any [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call based on each call's `freq` argument. Therefore, programmers typically include such calls within the local scopes of [conditional structures](#conditional-structures) to control when they execute.

Order fill alert triggers are available from [strategies](#strategies)*automatically* without requiring extra code. However, programmers can customize the default alert messages. These alerts fire on [order fill events](#order-fill-events), which occur when the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) fills a strategy's *orders*.

### [Messages](https://www.tradingview.com#messages)

The `message` parameter of the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function populates the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box with a default message, which script users can customize to suit their alert needs. It accepts a "const string" argument, meaning its value cannot change after compilation. However, the argument can include [placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000531021-how-to-use-a-variable-value-in-alert/) to make the message's information *dynamic*.

The `message` parameter of the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function accepts a "series string" argument, allowing programmers to create *dynamic messages* that can include "string" representations of a script's calculated values. Unlike [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition), this function does not populate a "Message" field in the "Create Alert" dialog box, and it does not process placeholders. Programmers can allow users to customize [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) messages by creating [inputs](#inputs) in the script's settings.

Order fill alerts have a default message that describes a strategy's order fill event. This default message contains strategy-specific [placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000531021-how-to-use-a-variable-value-in-alert/), which the alert replaces with current strategy information each time it fires. Programmers can override the default message using the `//@strategy_alert_message`[compiler annotation](#compiler-annotations), which allows text and strategy placeholders, but *not* script variables. Script users can edit the default message from the "Message" field in the "Create Alert" dialog.

The `alert_message` parameter in a strategy's [order placement commands](#order-placement-and-cancellation) allows programmers to define distinct messages for each order fill event. The parameter accepts "series string" values that can change on each event. To use the values from this parameter in a strategy's order fill alerts, include the `{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` placeholder in the `//@strategy_alert_message` annotation, or include it in the "Message" field when creating an alert.

### [Limitations](https://www.tradingview.com#limitations)

The [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function has some limitations:

- Each active alert condition counts toward the total number of alerts the user's [plan](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/) allows.
- Every [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) call contributes to the script's [plot count](#plot-limits).
- Only indicators can issue alert triggers with this function. Other script types do not raise a compilation error when they include calls to this function in their code, but each call has **no effect**.

By contrast, all calls to the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function count as **one** alert, regardless of the number of calls in the code. In addition, [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) calls *do not* contribute to a script's plot count.

Similarly, if a user creates a strategy alert based on [order fill events](#order-fill-events), it counts as **one** alert, even though it can fire multiple times with distinct messages from different order executions.

### [Example `alertcondition()` alert](https://www.tradingview.com#example-alertcondition-alert)

The script below demonstrates a simple [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) call that triggers alerts when the current bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) is above the value from the previous chart bar. It also uses a [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) call to indicate each bar where the `triggerCondition` occurred:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Simple alert demo", overlay = true)
// Create condition to trigger alert.
bool triggerCondition = close > close[1]
// Use `triggerCondition` for the `condition` parameter. 
// Define a title for the alert in the menu and a message to send with the alert. 
alertcondition(condition = triggerCondition, title = "Example `alertcondition` Alert", 
  message = "The example `alertcondition` alert was triggered.")
// Plot a shape when `triggerCondition` is true to visually mark where alerts occur.
plotshape(triggerCondition, "Trigger Condition", shape.xcross, color = color.fuchsia)
```

See [this section](#alertcondition-events) of the [Alerts](#alerts) page to learn more.

### [Example `alert()` alert](https://www.tradingview.com#example-alert-alert)

This example uses the `vstop()` function from our [ta](https://www.tradingview.com/script/BICzyhq0-ta/) library to calculate a volatility stop value and trend information based on the Average True Range ([ATR](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000501823-average-true-range-atr/)). The `stopValue` trails behind the chart's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) to form a trend-following system.

The script triggers an alert with an [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call each time the trend direction changes. The alert's message is a "series string" that shows the trend's new direction and the current stop value. An additional alert occurs whenever the `stopValue` moves in the current trend direction, with a message containing the updated value:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Vstop alert demo", overlay = true)

import TradingView/ta/7 as TVta

// Calculate ATR trailing stop and determine trend direction.
[stopValue, trendUp] = TVta.vStop(close, 20, 2)

// Round the stop value to mintick for accuracy in comparison operators.
float stop = math.round_to_mintick(stopValue)

// Check for trend changes.
bool  trendReversal = trendUp != trendUp[1]
bool  trendToDn     = trendReversal and not trendUp
bool  trendToUp     = trendReversal and     trendUp
// Create color variables for the plot display.
color plotColor     = trendUp ? color.green : color.red
color lineColor     = trendReversal ? color(na) : plotColor

// Plot the stop value on the chart. Plot a circle on trend changes.
plot(stop, "V-Stop", lineColor)
plot(trendReversal ? stop : na, "Trend Change Circle", plotColor, 3, plot.style_circles)

// Convert the stop value to string for use in the alert messages.
string stopStr = str.tostring(stop)

// If the trend changed to up, send a long alert with the initial stop value.
if trendToUp
    alert("Long alert. Stop @ " + stopStr, alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)

// If the trend changed to down, send a short alert with the initial stop value.
if trendToDn
    alert("Short alert. Stop @ " + stopStr, alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)

// If the stop value has progressed, send an alert to update the stop value.
if (trendUp and stop > stop[1] or not trendUp and stop < stop[1]) and not trendReversal
    alert('Update stop to ' + stopStr, alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
```

See [this section](#script-alerts) of the [Alerts](#alerts) page for more information.

### [Example strategy alert](https://www.tradingview.com#example-strategy-alert)

This example strategy places a [market order](#market-orders) with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) and a stop-loss and take-profit (bracket) order with [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) when a 5-bar moving average crosses over a 10-bar moving average. The stop-loss price is 1% below the current [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) and the take-profit price is 2% above the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close). Order fill alerts occur when the broker emulator fills an entry or exit order. Both [order placement commands](#order-placement-and-cancellation) include unique `alert_message` arguments that combine placeholders and "string" representations of the `limit` and `stop` values to output details like the trade action, position size, chart symbol, and order prices:

```
//@version=6

// This annotation auto-populates the alert dialogue with the `alert_message` string.
// @strategy_alert_message {{strategy.order.alert_message}}

strategy("Alert message demo", overlay = true)

// Declare two moving averages to use for the entry condition.
float fastMa = ta.sma(close, 5)
float slowMa = ta.sma(close, 10)
// Declare two persistent variables that will hold our stop-loss and take-profit values.
var float limit = na
var float stop  = na

// If `fastMa` has crossed over `slowMa` and we are not already in a position,
// place an entry and exit order. 
//      • Set the `limit` to 2% above the close and the stop to 1% below.
//      • Use a combination of script variables and placeholders in the alert strings.
//      • The exit alert shows the order direction, position size, ticker, and order price.
//      • The entry alert includes the same values plus the stop and limit price.
if ta.crossover(fastMa, slowMa) and strategy.position_size == 0
    limit := close * 1.02
    stop  := close * 0.99
    string exitString  = "{{strategy.order.action}} {{strategy.position_size}} {{ticker}} @ {{strategy.order.price}}"
    string entryString = exitString + " TP: " + str.tostring(limit, format.mintick) + " SL: " + 
      str.tostring(stop, format.mintick)
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, alert_message = entryString)
    strategy.exit("Exit", "Buy", stop = stop, limit = limit, alert_message = exitString)

// Plot the moving averages, stop, and limit values on the chart.
plot(fastMa, "Fast Moving Average", color.aqua)
plot(slowMa, "Slow Moving Average", color.orange)
plot(strategy.position_size > 0 ? limit : na, "Limit", color.green, style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(strategy.position_size > 0 ? stop  : na, "Stop",  color.red,   style = plot.style_linebr)
```

For more information about order fill events, see [this section](#order-fill-events) of the [Alerts](#alerts) page. To learn more about how strategy scripts work, see the [Strategies](#strategies) page.

## [If I change my script, does my alert change?](https://www.tradingview.com#if-i-change-my-script-does-my-alert-change)

No, not without creating a new alert.

When a user creates an alert using the "Create Alert" dialog box, that action saves a "snapshot" of the script, its inputs, and the current chart's context on TradingView's servers. This snapshot acts as an independent *copy* of the script instance and chart. Therefore, any changes to the script, its inputs, or the user's chart **do not** affect that created alert. To update an alert after making changes, *delete* the existing alert and *create* a new one.

## [Why aren't my alerts working?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-arent-my-alerts-working)

Here are some common reasons why alerts might not work as expected, and how to solve them:

**Make sure the alert is active and has not expired**

Scripts that include alert triggers **do not** directly create alerts. Users must create alerts in the "Create Alert" dialog box, where they specify the "Condition" that triggers the alert and the "Expiration" time. Created alerts do not fire after they expire. See this Help Center article on [Setting up alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000595315-how-to-set-up-alerts/).

**Check the alert logs**

An alert can fire without a notification, depending on the alert's settings. Check the logs in the [alert manager](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000595311-manage-alerts/) to see whether an alert occurred. To set up notifications for an alert, use the options in the "Notifications" tab of the "Create/Edit Alert" dialog box.

**Check for repainting**

If an alert fires at a different time than expected, *repainting* might be the cause. Refer to the [Repainting](#repainting) page for more information.

**Limit the frequency of alerts**

If more than 15 alerts occur within three minutes, the system automatically *halts* further alerts. This [frequency limit](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000690939-alert-was-triggered-too-often-and-stopped/) helps prevent excessive notifications and potential server overload.

**Debug script errors**

If a script instance raises a *runtime error* at some point during its executions, alerts from that instance **cannot** fire because the error stops the script from continuing to execute its code. Some common issues that can halt alerts include:

- Attempting to store more than 100,000 elements within a [collection](#collections)
- Trying to access an item from a collection at an *out-of-bounds* index
- Referencing historical values of a time series outside its allocated [memory buffer](#pine-script-cannot-determine-the-referencing-length-of-a-series-try-using-max_bars_back-in-the-indicator-or-strategy-function)
- Using [loops](#loops) that take longer than 500 ms to complete their iterations

See [this page](#error-messages) for additional details about common error messages and troubleshooting tips.

## [Why is my alert firing at the wrong time?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-is-my-alert-firing-at-the-wrong-time)

Sometimes, alerts may fire when users do not expect according to what their script displays on the chart. [Repainting](#repainting) is the typical cause of such issues.

A chart's realtime and historical bars often rely on *different*[data feeds](#data-feeds). Data providers may retroactively adjust the reported values on realtime bars, which the displayed data reflects *after* users refresh their charts or restart their scripts. Such adjustments can cause discrepancies where a triggered alert's timing may not align with the script's output after reloading it.

Scripts may also behave differently on historical and realtime bars, which can lead to repainting. On historical bars, scripts execute once per bar close, whereas on realtime bars, where alerts fire, scripts execute once for *each new tick* from the data feed. Therefore, if a script behaves differently on those bars, users may see differences between its signals and triggered alerts after reloading the chart.

Below are some common repainting issues that can affect a script's alerts:

**Alerts firing before bar close**

Most scripts have [fluid data values](#fluid-data-values) that update after new ticks during an unconfirmed realtime bar and finalize after the bar closes. Consequently, an alert that fires on an open bar may not reflect the *final state* of the condition after the bar's confirmation. Set the alert's frequency to "Once Per Bar Close" to avoid this issue.

**Using `calc_on_every_tick` in strategies**

When a strategy script includes `calc_on_every_tick = true` in its declaration statement or the user selects the "On every tick" option in the "Recalculate" section of the strategy's [properties](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000628599-strategy-properties/), it recalculates on *every* price update in the realtime data. This behavior can cause strategies to repaint because historical bars do not contain the same information as realtime bars. See [this section](#altering-calculation-behavior) of the [Strategies](#strategies) page to learn more.

**Incorrect usage of `request.security()` calls**

Using [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) calls to fetch data from alternative timeframes can cause discrepancies on historical bars that scripts **cannot** reproduce on realtime bars. Ensure you follow the best practices for *non-repainting* data requests to avoid such discrepancies, especially with higher-timeframe data. See the [Avoiding repainting](#avoiding-repainting) section of the [Other timeframes and data](#other-timeframes-and-data) page and the [Higher-timeframe requests](https://www.tradingview.com/script/W1YpYcOI-Higher-timeframe-requests/) publication from PineCoders for more information.

## [Can I use variable messages with alertcondition()?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-use-variable-messages-with-alertcondition)

The `message` parameter of the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function requires a "const string" argument, which **cannot change** after compilation. However, the "string" can include [placeholders](#placeholders), which an alert substitutes with corresponding dynamic values from a script each time it fires.

The script below demonstrates two [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) calls whose `message` arguments include placeholders for dynamic values. Each time alerts from these triggers occur, the message displays information about the current chart's exchange, symbol, price, and volume:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Placeholder demo", overlay = false)

[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
plot(macdLine,   "MACD",   color.blue)
plot(signalLine, "Signal", color.orange)
plot(histLine,   "Hist.",  color.red, style = plot.style_histogram)

bool crossUp = ta.crossover(macdLine,  signalLine)
bool crossDown = ta.crossunder(macdLine, signalLine)

alertcondition(crossUp, "MACD Cross Up",   "MACD cross up on {{exchange}}:{{ticker}}\nprice = {{close}}\nvolume = {{volume}}")
alertcondition(crossDown, "MACD Cross Down", "MACD cross down on {{exchange}}:{{ticker}}\nprice = {{close}}\nvolume = {{volume}}")
```

## [How can I include values that change in my alerts?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-include-values-that-change-in-my-alerts)

The method for including dynamic values in alert messages varies with the type of alert trigger:

- The [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function accepts a "const string" `message` argument that can contain placeholders for dynamic values. See [Can I use variable messages with `alertcondition()`?](#can-i-use-variable-messages-with-alertcondition) for more information.
- The [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function accepts "series string" `message` arguments, which allows the convenient creation of dynamic messages that use a script's calculated values. See [this section](#example-alert-alert) for an example.
- Order fill alerts can use "series string" values and placeholders. Refer to the example [here](#example-strategy-alert).

## [How can I get custom alerts on many symbols?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-get-custom-alerts-on-many-symbols)

To manage alerts across multiple symbols using a custom script, one option is to set an individual alert on each symbol. There is no automated method to set the same alert across many symbols simultaneously in a single action. It's also important to note that the TradingView [screener](https://www.tradingview.com/screener/) uses built-in filters and does not support custom Pine Script™ code.

Scripts can retrieve data from other *contexts* (symbols, timeframes, and modifiers such as non-standard chart calculations and extended sessions) using the functions in the `request.*()` namespace. With these functions, programmers can design scripts that retrieve data from up to 40 unique contexts. Search for "[screener](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/search/screener/)" in the Community scripts for in-depth examples.

Here is an example incorporating three symbols. The `checkForAlert()` function calls [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) to fetch data from a specified context and evaluate the user-defined `checkForRsiConditions()` function using that data. Then, the function calls [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) using the result to create an alert trigger. The script calls this function three times, creating distinct alert triggers for each specified symbol:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Screener demo", overlay = true)

// Declare inputs for the alert symbols and the timeframe to run the alerts on. The default is the current chart timeframe.
string tfInput      = input.timeframe("", "Timeframe")
string symbol1Input = input.symbol("BINANCE:ETHUSDT", "Symbol 1")
string symbol2Input = input.symbol("BINANCE:BATUSDT", "Symbol 2")
string symbol3Input = input.symbol("BINANCE:SOLUSDT", "Symbol 3")

// @function    Generates alert messages for RSI crossing over or under 50, and crosses of price and the 50 EMA.
// @returns     (string) Formatted alert messages with values for each crossover and crossunder event.
checkForRsiConditions() =>
    float  rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)
    float  ema = ta.ema(close, 50)
    string alertMessage = ""
    if ta.crossover(rsi, 50)
        alertMessage += str.format("RSI ({0}) crossed over 50 for {1} on {2} timeframe.\n", rsi, syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period)
    if ta.crossunder(rsi, 50)
        alertMessage += str.format("RSI ({0}) crossed under 50 for {1} on {2} timeframe.\n", rsi, syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period)
    if ta.crossover(close, ema)
        alertMessage += str.format("Crossover of 50 EMA for {0} on {1} timeframe. Price is {2}", syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period, close)
    if ta.crossunder(close, ema)
        alertMessage += str.format("Crossunder of 50 EMA for {0} on {1} timeframe. Price is {2}", syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period, close)

// @function        Calls the `checkForRsiConditions()` function for the provided symbol and timeframe. 
//                      Triggers an alert if the function returns a message.
// @param symbol    (simple string) The symbol to check.
// @param tf        (simple string) The timeframe to check.
// @param freq      (const string) The frequency of the alert. Optional. Default is `alert.freq_once_per_bar`.
// @returns         (void) The function has no explicit return, but triggers an alert with the message if the
//                          conditions defined within the `checkForRsiConditions()` function are met.
checkForAlert(simple string symbol, simple string tf, const string freq = alert.freq_once_per_bar) =>
    string msg = request.security(symbol, tf, checkForRsiConditions())
    if msg != msg[1] and str.length(msg) > 0
        alert(msg, freq)

// Check for alerts on the input symbols and timeframe.
checkForAlert(symbol1Input, tfInput)
checkForAlert(symbol2Input, tfInput)
checkForAlert(symbol3Input, tfInput)
// Continue with additional symbols up to a maximum of 40...
```

Note that:

- A script can execute up to 40 *unique*`request.*()` calls. A `request.*()` call is not unique if a script already calls the same function with the same arguments. See [this section](#number-of-calls) of the [Limitations](#limitations) page for more information.
- This script uses the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function because [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) is not allowed within *local scopes*.

## [How can I trigger an alert for only the first instance of a condition?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-trigger-an-alert-for-only-the-first-instance-of-a-condition)

Firing an alert only on its first occurrence can help avoid redundant notifications and isolate specific conditions or state changes, which is beneficial in several use cases. For instance, if a user relies on alerts to automate order placement, restricting redundant alerts to their first occurrence can help avoid accidentally placing excessive orders.

For alerts with [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) triggers, setting them to fire once using the "Only Once" option in the "Create Alert" dialog box is not an optimal solution because it requires *manual* reactivation each time an alert occurs. Alerts from the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function do not have an "Only Once" frequency option. The programmer must use conditional logic to ensure the call executes at the appropriate time.

There are two primary ways to code repeating alerts that fire on only the first instance of a condition:

**Using more strict criteria**

Rather than relying on a continuous condition like `close > ma`, which may remain `true` for multiple consecutive bars, try using a more strict condition like [ta.crossover(close, ma)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.crossover). For simple cases, this is the easiest method.

**Using state control**

More complex scenarios may require controlling and tracking *states*, which entails setting flags or specific values to signify certain conditions.

The example script below manages separate bullish and bearish states, and it colors the background to represent each state. When a bullish or bearish state first occurs, an [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call executes and the script plots a triangle on the chart. It also plots smaller triangles to show where other signals occur within a state, which do not trigger additional alerts:

// ![image](images/Alerts-How-can-i-trigger-an-alert-only-once-when-the-condition-is-true-the-first-time-1.D3rDfnca_Z1HVNwq.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Single alert demo", overlay = true)

// ————— Calculations: Determine highest/lowest values over last `lengthInput` bars.
int   lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length")
float highest     = ta.highest(lengthInput)
float lowest      = ta.lowest(lengthInput)
// ————— Trigger conditions: Define bull and bear signals. Bull signal is triggered by a new high, and bear by a new low.
bool bullSignal = high == highest
bool bearSignal = low  == lowest
// ————— State change flags: Set true on state transition bars only.
bool changeToBull = false
bool changeToBear = false
// ————— State tracking: `isBull` is set to true for bull state, false for bear. It's set only at the initial switch to the opposite condition.
// This variable's state is retained from bar to bar because we use the `var` keyword to declare it.
var bool isBull = false
// ————— State transitions: Allow a switch from bull to bear or bear to bull; ignore repeated signals in current state.
// Set the state change flags to true only on the first bar where a new signal appears.
if bullSignal and not isBull
    isBull       := true
    changeToBull := true
else if bearSignal and isBull
    isBull       := false
    changeToBear := true

// Plot highest and lowest values.
plot(highest, "Highest", color.new(color.green, 80), 2)
plot(lowest,  "Lowest",  color.new(color.red,   80), 2)
// Background color: Green for bull, none for bear.
bgcolor(isBull ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na)
// State change markers: Display "ALERT" text on bars where a state change occurs and an alert would trigger.
plotchar(changeToBull, "Change to Bull state", "▲", location.belowbar, color.new(color.lime, 30), size = size.small, text = "BULL\nALERT")
plotchar(changeToBear, "Change to Bear state", "▼", location.abovebar, color.new(color.red,  30), size = size.small, text = "BEAR\nALERT")
// Signal markers: Display for repeated signals within the current state.
// These signals would trigger redundant alerts if not for the state tracking flag preventing them.
plotchar(bullSignal and not changeToBull, "Bull signal", "▲", location.belowbar, color.green,  size = size.tiny)
plotchar(bearSignal and not changeToBear, "Bear signal", "▼", location.abovebar, color.maroon, size = size.tiny)

// Alerts: Trigger on state changes only.
if changeToBull
    alert("Change to bull state")
if changeToBear
    alert("Change to bear state")
```

## [How can I run my alert on a timer or delay?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-run-my-alert-on-a-timer-or-delay)

It is possible to program logic to delay alert triggers so that they occur *after* the initial condition. However, because Pine scripts execute on realtime bars only after new *price updates*, and an alert only fires when a script *executes*, it is difficult to predict the exact time of a delayed alert.

There are no price updates in a closed market, meaning an alert with a delay will not fire until the market opens again. Similarly, thinly traded securities may have very infrequent price updates in unpredictable intervals, which can cause a larger delay than intended.

The Pine script below implements a *time-delayed* alert, which is subject to the limitations above. When the current [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) is higher than a moving average, a delay counter starts. After the delay passes, the alert fires once, and another alert *cannot* fire until the timer resets. Users can specify whether the timer resets on each bar using the script's `resetInput`:

![image](images/Alerts-How-can-i-run-my-alert-on-a-timer-or-delay-1.K7lVQTwy_Z1XdLyV.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Delayed alert demo", overlay = true)

import PineCoders/Time/4 as PCtime

string TIME_TT  = "The delay's duration and units. This specifies the continuous duration for which the condition must be true before triggering the alert."
string RESET_TT = "When checked, the duration will reset every time a new realtime bar begins."

enum TimeUnit
    seconds
    minutes
    hours

int    durationInput = input.int(20,     "Condition must last",     minval  = 1,       inline = "00")
TimeUnit timeUnitInput = input.enum(TimeUnit.seconds, "", inline="00")
bool   resetInput    = input.bool(false, "Reset timing on new bar", tooltip = RESET_TT)
int    maLengthInput = input.int(9,      "MA length")

// Calculate and plot a SMA with `maLengthInput` length.
float ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput), plot(ma, "MA")
// Check whether the close is greater than the SMA.
bool cond = close > ma
// Time the duration for which the condition has been true.
int secSince = PCtime.secondsSince(cond, resetInput and barstate.isnew)
// Check if the duration is greater than the input timer.
bool timeAlert = secSince > (PCtime.timeFrom("bar", durationInput, str.tostring(timeUnitInput)) - time) / 1000
// Format a time string for the timer label.
string alertTime = str.format_time(secSince * 1000, "mm:ss")

// Set the contents for the label depending on the stage of the alert timer.
string alertString = switch
    timeAlert => "Timed Alert Triggered\n\n" + alertTime
    cond      => "Condition Detected...\n\nTimer count\n" + alertTime
    =>           "Waiting for condition..."

// Display alert timer using a label.  Declare a basic label once and update location, color, and text on the last bar for efficiency.
if barstate.islast
    var label condTime = label.new(na, na, yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_label_lower_left, textcolor = chart.fg_color)
    label.set_x(condTime, bar_index)
    label.set_text(condTime, alertString)
    label.set_color(condTime, color.new(timeAlert ? color.green : cond ? color.orange : color.red, 50))

// Create a flag to ensure alert is triggered only once each time the delay timer is exceeded.
varip bool isFirstOccurrence = true
// Fire alert if timer is triggered.
if timeAlert and isFirstOccurrence
    alert(str.format("{0} {1} Delayed Alert Triggered", durationInput, str.tostring(timeUnitInput)), alert.freq_all)

// Toggle the flag to `false` when alert triggers, and reset when the condition clears.
isFirstOccurrence := not timeAlert
```

Note that:

- The `secondsSince()` function from the PineCoders' [time](https://www.tradingview.com/script/tyeeNU9I-Time/) library determines the duration, in seconds, for which a certain condition remains continuously `true`. The duration can be tracked within bars because it uses the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword.
- The timing starts when the condition first becomes `true`. If the condition becomes `false` or an optional resetting condition occurs, the timer restarts. If "Reset timing on new bar" is enabled in the "Settings/Inputs" tab, the function restarts its timing at the start of a new bar.
- A colored label shows what state the script is in:
    1. **Red** - The condition has not occurred yet.
    2. **Orange** - The condition occurred and the delay timer is active.
    3. **Green** - The timer has surpassed the set duration, simulating a delayed alert.

This script relies on variables declared with the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword, which do not revert to their last committed states during realtime bar calculations. See [this section](#varip) of the User Manual to learn more about using this keyword. To learn about how *rollback* works, see the [Execution model](#execution-model) page.

## [How can I create JSON messages in my alerts?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-create-json-messages-in-my-alerts)

Alerts can send messages containing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to [webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/). Pine Script™ does not include any built-in functions to produce JSON, but programmers can create JSON messages in Pine by constructing "string" representations.

When constructing JSON representations, ensure the keys and values intended as strings in the JSON-formatted text use *double quotes*, not single quotes.

The following example shows three ways to construct JSON strings in Pine Script™:

1. **Static JSON Strings**

   Define separate alerts with predefined JSON-formatted strings. This method is the simplest.
2. **Placeholders**

   Use [placeholders](#placeholders) in the alert message, such as `{{close}}` and `{{volume}}`, to add *dynamic* values to the JSON. The alert instance replaces the placeholders with corresponding values when it fires. This method can create richer alerts, especially for [strategies](#strategies), which have [extra placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000481368-strategy-alerts/) for their calculated values. See [this section](#example-strategy-alert) above for an example.
3. **Dynamic strings**

   Use the functions in the `str.*()` namespace and "string" concatenation to create dynamic JSON-formatted text. This method is the most customizable and advanced. Our script below shows a simple, straightforward example of this approach. When using dynamic string formatting to construct JSON strings, ensure the resulting JSON is *valid* for all the combined values.

```
//@version=6
indicator("JSON example", overlay = true)

// Define EMA cross conditions to trigger alerts, and plot the ema on the chart.
float ema = ta.ema(close, 21)
bool crossUp    = ta.crossover(close, ema)
bool crossDown  = ta.crossunder(close, ema)
plot(ta.ema(close, 21))

// ————— Method 1 - Separate alerts with static messages.
string alertMessage1a = '{"method": 1, "action": "buy", "direction": "long", "text": "Price crossed above EMA"}'
string alertMessage1b = '{"method": 1, "action": "sell", "direction": "short", "text": "Price crossed below EMA"}'
alertcondition(crossUp,     "Method 1 - Cross up",   alertMessage1a)
alertcondition(crossDown,   "Method 1 - Cross down", alertMessage1b)

// Rendered alert:
// {
//     "method": 1,
//     "action": "buy",
//     "direction": "long",
//     "text": "Price crossed above EMA"
// }

// ————— Method 2 - Using placeholders for dynamic values.
string alertMessage2 = '{"method": 2, "price": {{close}}, "volume": {{volume}}, "ema": {{plot_0}}}'
alertcondition(crossUp, "Method 2 - Cross Up", alertMessage2)

// Rendered alert:
// {
//     "method": 2,
//     "price": 2066.29,
//     "volume": 100.859,
//     "ema": 2066.286
// }

// ————— Method 3 - String concatenation using dynamic values.
string alertMessage3 =
 '{"method": 3, "price": ' + str.tostring(close) + ', "volume": ' + str.tostring(volume) + ', "ema": ' + str.tostring(ema) + '}'
if crossUp
    alert(alertMessage3, alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)

// Rendered alert:
// {
//     "method": 3,
//     "price": 2052.27,
//     "volume": 107.683,
//     "ema": 2052.168
// }
```

Before using the JSON-formatted string in alerts for real-world applications, such as sending messages to place orders, *test* and *validate* the JSON message to ensure it works as intended:

- Send alerts to an email address to see how the JSON message appears.
- Copy the alert message from the email into an online JSON validation tool.
- Use an API client application to check the server response to the request.

Refer to [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) to learn more about JSON format. To learn more about how alerts send information using webhooks, see the Help Center article on [webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/).

## [How can I send alerts to Discord?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-send-alerts-to-discord)

Sending alerts from a Pine script to a Discord chat room is possible using [webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/).

The message for Discord communication requires [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). The *minimum* requirement for a valid message is `{"content": "Your message here"}`.

The script example below uses [placeholders](#placeholders) to dynamically populate alert messages with script values, including the new high or low price, and the chart's symbol and timeframe:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Discord demo", overlay = true)
// Calculate a Donchian channel using the TV ta library.
import TradingView/ta/7 as TVta
int lengthInput = input.int(10, "Channel length")
[highest, lowest, middle] = TVta.donchian(lengthInput)
// Create conditions checking for a new channel high or low.
bool isNewHi = high > highest[1]
bool isNewLo = low  <  lowest[1]
// Plot the Donchian channel and fill between the midpoint and the upper and lower halves.
hi  = plot(highest, "Channel high", color.new(color.fuchsia, 70))
mid = plot(middle,  "Channel mid.", color.new(color.gray,    70))
lo  = plot(lowest,  "Channel low",  color.new(color.lime,    70))
fill(mid, hi, color.new(color.fuchsia, 95))
fill(mid, lo, color.new(color.lime,    95))
// Plot shapes to mark new highs and lows to visually identify where alert trigger conditions occur.
plotshape(isNewHi, "isNewHi", shape.arrowup,   location.abovebar, color.new(color.lime,    70))
plotshape(isNewLo, "isNewLo", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.new(color.fuchsia, 70))
// Create two alert conditions, one for new highs, and one for new lows.
// Format the message for Discord in the following JSON format: {"content": "Your message here"}
alertcondition(isNewHi, "New High (Discord Alert Demo)", '{"content": "New high ({{high}}) on {{ticker}} on {{interval}} chart!"}')
alertcondition(isNewLo, "New Low  (Discord Alert Demo)", '{"content": "New low ({{low}}) on {{ticker}} on {{interval}} chart!"}')
// The following test alert condition fires immediately. Set this alert frequency to "Only Once".
alertcondition(true, "Test (Discord Alert Demo)", '{"content": "This is a test alert from TradingView to Discord."}')
```

To send these alert messages to Discord, follow these steps:

**1. Create a Discord webhook**

- Create a new webhook in a server using an account with webhook creation and management permissions. Refer to Discord's [Intro to Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) article for instructions.
- Copy the Webhook URL. This URL represents the address where the alert sends a POST request.

**2. Set up an alert on TradingView**

- Add the above "Discord demo" script to a chart and open the "Create Alert" dialog box.
- Choose one of the script's alert conditions as the "Condition" in the dialog. If you select the "New High" or "New Low" alerts, choose the "Once Per Bar Close" option in the "Frequency" field to avoid triggering alerts for new highs or lows on an unconfirmed bar. When using the "Test" alert, choose "Only Once" as the "Frequency" option.
- In the "Notifications" tab of the "Create Alert" dialog, select "Webhook URL" and paste the URL of the Discord webhook.

**3. Test the integration**

- Check that alerts appear in the alert log on TradingView.
- Use the "Test" alert to check whether the webhook works as expected. After the alert fires, check your Discord to see if it received the message.
- If the alert message does not appear in Discord, check whether the pasted webhook URL is correct.
- If the message does not display correctly in Discord, check the JSON format. The minimum required format is `{"content": "Your message here"}`.

Consult Discord's [Webhook Resource](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#webhook-resource) to learn about advanced JSON message configurations.

For more information about dynamic values in alert messages, refer to [How can I include values that change in my alerts?](http://localhost:4321/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-include-values-that-change-in-my-alerts).

To learn about using JSON format in script alerts, see [How can I create JSON messages in my alerts?](http://localhost:4321/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-create-json-messages-in-my-alerts).

## [How can I send alerts to Telegram?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-send-alerts-to-telegram)

Sending TradingView alerts directly to Telegram is challenging due to protocol differences and formatting requirements. One solution is to use an intermediary service, which receives webhook alerts from TradingView, formats them as required by Telegram, and then forwards them to a Telegram bot.

1. Choose a platform like Zapier, Integromat, or Pipedream. Alternatively, programmers can consider developing a custom server script using Node.js or Python.
2. In TradingView, set up alerts to send [webhook requests](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/) to the intermediary service's provided URL.
3. Configure the intermediary service to reformat TradingView's incoming requests for Telegram's API and send the formatted message to a Telegram bot using the `sendMessage` method.

See the Telegram Bot API [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for detailed technical information.

# [Data structures](https://www.tradingview.com#data-structures)

## [What data structures can I use in Pine Script™?](https://www.tradingview.com#what-data-structures-can-i-use-in-pine-script)

Pine data structures resemble those in other programming languages, with some important differences:

- **Tuple**: An arbitrary—and temporary—grouping of values of one or more types.
- **Array**: An ordered sequence of values of a single type.
- **Matrix**: A two-dimensional ordered sequence of values of a single type.
- **Object**: An arbitrary—and persistent—collection of values of one or more types.
- **Map**: An *unordered* sequence of key-value pairs, where the keys are of a single type and the values are of a single type.

The following sections describe each data structure in more detail.

### [Tuples](https://www.tradingview.com#tuples)

A [tuple](#tuples) in Pine Script™ is a list of values that is returned by a [function](#user-defined-functions), [method](#methods), or local block. Unlike in other languages, tuples in Pine serve no other function.
Tuples do not have names and cannot be assigned to variables.
Apart from the fact that the values are requested and returned together, the values have no relation to each other, in contrast to the other data structures described here.

To define a tuple, enclose a comma-separated list of values in square brackets.

Using a tuple to request several values from the same symbol and timeframe using a [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call is more efficient than making several calls. For instance, consider a script that contains separate [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) calls for the
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low), and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) prices:

```
float o = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", open)
float h = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", high)
float l = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", low)
float c = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", close)
```

Using a tuple can consolidate these calls into a single [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function call, reducing performance overhead:

```
[o, h, l, c] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", [open, high, low, close])
```

See the [Tuples](#tuples) section in the User Manual for more information.

### [Arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#arrays)

[Arrays](#arrays) store multiple values of the same [type](#type-system) in a single variable. Each *element* in an array can be efficiently accessed by its *index*—an integer corresponding to its position within the array.

Arrays can contain an arbitrary number of elements. Scripts can loop through arrays, testing each element in turn for certain logical conditions. There are also many built-in functions to perform different operations on arrays. This flexibility makes arrays very versatile data structures.

Arrays can be created with either the [array.new<type>()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.new%3Ctype%3E)
or [array.from()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.from) function. In this simple example, we store the last five closing prices in an array and display it in a table:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Array example")
// Declare an array with 5 `na` values on the first bar.
var array<float> pricesArray = array.new<float>(5)
// On each bar, add a new value to the end of the array and remove the first (oldest) element.
array.push(pricesArray, close)
array.shift(pricesArray)
// Display the array and its contents in a table.
var table displayTable = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1)
if barstate.islast
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 0, str.tostring(pricesArray), text_color = chart.fg_color)
```

See the [Arrays](#arrays) section in the User Manual for more information.

### [Matrices](https://www.tradingview.com#matrices)

A [matrix](#matrices) is a two-dimensional array, made of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet. Matrices, like arrays, store values of the same built-in or user-defined [type](#types).

Matrices have many built-in functions available to organize and manipulate their data. Matrices are useful for modeling complex systems, solving mathematical problems, and improving algorithm performance.

This script demonstrates a simple example of matrix addition. It creates a 3x3 matrix, calculates its [transpose](#transposing), then calculates the
[matrix.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.sum) of the two matrices. This example displays the original matrix, its
[transpose](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.transpose), and the resulting sum matrix in a table on the chart.

var table displayTable = table.new(position.middle_right, 5, 2)

```

See the [Matrices](#matrices) section in the User Manual for more information.

### [Objects](https://www.tradingview.com#objects)

Pine Script™ [objects](#objects) are containers that group together multiple fields into one logical unit.

Objects are *instances* of [user-defined types](#user-defined-types) (UDTs). UDTs are similar to *structs* in traditional programming languages. They define the rules for what an object can contain. Scripts first create a UDT by using the [type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_type) keyword and then create one or more objects of that type by using the UDT's built-in `new()` method.

UDTs are *composite* types; they contain an arbitrary number of fields that can be of any type. A UDT's field type can even be another UDT, which means that objects can contain other objects.

Our example script creates a new `pivot` object each time a new pivot is found, and draws a label using each of the object's fields:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Object example", overlay = true)

// Create the pivot type with 3 fields: the x coordinate, the y coordinate, and a formatted time string.
type pivot
    int x
    float y
    string pivotTime
// Check for new pivots. `ta.pivotHigh` returns the price of the pivot.
float pivFound = ta.pivothigh(10, 10)
// When a pivot is found, create a new pivot object and generate a label using the values from its fields.
if not na(pivFound)
    pivot pivotObject = pivot.new(bar_index - 10, pivFound, str.format_time(time[10], "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"))
    label.new(pivotObject.x, pivotObject.y, pivotObject.pivotTime, textcolor = chart.fg_color)
```

See the User Manual page on [Objects](#objects) to learn more about working with UDTs.

### [Maps](https://www.tradingview.com#maps)

[Maps](#maps) in Pine Script™ are similar to *dictionaries* in other programming languages, such as dictionaries in Python, objects in JavaScript, or HashMaps in Java.
Maps store elements as key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Scripts can access a particular value by looking up its associated key.

Maps are useful when accessing data directly without searching through each element, as you need to do with arrays. For example, maps can be more performant and simpler than arrays for associating specific attributes with symbols, or dates with events.

The following example illustrates the practical application of maps for managing earnings dates and values as key-value pairs, with dates serving as the keys:

![image](images/Data-structures-What-are-the-primary-data-structues-available-in-the-pine-script-2.F207zRIS_Kr85n.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Earnings map", overlay = true)
// Get the earnings value if present. We use `barmerge.gaps_on` to return `na` unless earnings occurred.
float earnings = request.earnings(syminfo.tickerid, earnings.actual, barmerge.gaps_on)
// Declare a map object for storing earnings dates and values.
var map<string, float> earningsMap = map.new<string, float>()
// If `request.security()` returned data, add an entry to the map with the date as the key and earnings as the value.
if not na(earnings)
    map.put(earningsMap, str.format_time(time, "yyyy-MM-dd"), earnings)
// On the last historical bar, loop through the map in the insertion order, writing the key-value pairs to the logs.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    string logText = "\n"
    for [key, value] in earningsMap
        logText += str.format("{0}: {1}\n", key, value)
    log.info(logText)
```

Here, we use [request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.earnings) with the barmerge parameter set to [barmerge.gaps_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.gaps_on) to return the earnings value on bars where earnings data is available, and return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) otherwise.
We add non-na values to the map, associating the dates that earnings occurred with the earnings numbers. Finally, on the last historical bar, the script [loops through the map](#looping-through-a-map), logging each key-value pair to display the map's contents.

To learn more about working with maps, refer to the [Maps](#maps) section in the User Manual.

## [What's the difference between a series and an array?](https://www.tradingview.com#whats-the-difference-between-a-series-and-an-array)

In Pine Script™, ["series"](#series) variables are calculated on each bar. Historical values cannot change. Series values can change during the realtime bar, but when the bar closes, the value for that bar becomes fixed and immutable.
These fixed values are automatically indexed for each bar. Scripts can access values from previous bars by using the [[] history-referencing operator](#--history-referencing-operator)) to go back one or more bars.

Where "series" variables are strictly time-indexed, and the historical values are created automatically, [arrays](#arrays) are created, filled, and manipulated arbitrarily by a script's logic. Programmers can change the size of arrays dynamically by using functions that [insert or remove elements](#inserting-and-removing-array-elements). Any element in an array can also be altered using the [array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set) function.

The concept of [time series](#time-series) is a fundamental aspect of Pine Script™. Its series-based [execution model](#execution-model) processes scripts bar-by-bar. This built-in behavior mimics looping, allowing a series to track values, accumulate totals, or perform calculations across a sequence of data on each bar.

Simple calculations can thus be done efficiently using "series" variables. Using arrays for similar tasks requires manually creating a dataset, managing its size, and using loops to process the array's contents, which can be far less efficient.

Arrays, of course, can do many things that series variables cannot. Scripts can use arrays to store a fixed set of values, store complex data such as User-Defined Types, manipulate objects for visual display, and more.
In general, use arrays to handle data that doesn't fit the time series model, or for complex calculations. Arrays can also mimic series by creating custom datasets, as in the [getSeries](https://www.tradingview.com/script/Bn7QkdZR-getSeries/) library.

## [How do I create and use arrays in Pine Script™?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-create-and-use-arrays-in-pine-script)

Pine Script™ [arrays](#arrays) are one-dimensional collections that can hold multiple values of a single type.

**Declaring arrays**

Declare an array by using one of the following functions:
[array.new<type>()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.new%3Ctype%3E),
[array.from()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dfrom),
or
[array.copy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dcopy).
Arrays can be declared with the [var](#var) keyword to have their values persist from bar to bar, or without it, so that the values initialize again on each bar.
For more on the differences between declaring arrays with or without [var](#var), see [this section](#whats-the-difference-between-an-array-declared-with-or-without-var) of this FAQ.

**Adding and removing elements**

Pine Script™ provides several functions for dynamically adjusting the size and contents of arrays.

**Adding elements**

- [array.unshift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dunshift)
  inserts a new element at the beginning of an array (index 0) and increases the index values of any existing elements by one.
- [array.insert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dinsert)
  inserts a new element at the specified index and increases the index of existing elements at or after the insertion index by one. It accepts both positive and [negative indices](#negative-indexing), which reference an element's position starting from the beginning of the array or from the end, respectively.
- [array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dpush)
  adds a new element at the end of an array.

**Removing elements**

- [array.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dremove)
  removes the element at the specified index and returns that element's value. It accepts both positive and [negative indices](#negative-indexing), which reference an element's position starting from the beginning of the array or from the end, respectively.
- [array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dshift)
  removes the first element from an array and returns its value.
- [array.pop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dpop)
  removes the last element of an array and returns its value.
- [array.clear()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dclear)
  removes all elements from an array. Note that clearing an array won't delete any objects that were referenced by its elements. If you want to delete objects contained by an array, loop through the array and delete the objects first, and then clear the array.

The flexibility afforded by these functions supports various data management strategies, such as
[queues](#using-an-array-as-a-queue) or [stacks](#using-an-array-as-a-stack), which are useful for custom datasets or sliding window calculations.
Read more about implementing a stack or queue in [this FAQ entry](#what-are-queues-and-stacks).

**Calculations on arrays**

Because arrays are not [time series](#time-series) data structures, performing operations across an array's elements requires special functions designed for arrays.
Programmers can write custom functions to perform calculations on arrays. Additionally, built-in functions enable computations like finding the maximum, minimum, or average values within an array.
See the [Calculation on arrays](#calculations-on-arrays) section of the User Manual for more information.

**Script example**

This script example demonstrates a practical application of arrays by tracking the opening prices of the last five sessions. The script declares a float array to hold the prices using the [var](#var) keyword, allowing it to retain its values from bar to bar.

At the start of each session, we update the array by adding the new opening price and removing the oldest one. This process, resembling a [queue](#using-an-array-as-a-queue), keeps the array's size constant while maintaining a moving window of the session opens for the last five days.
Built-in array functions return the highest, lowest, and average opening price over the last five sessions. We plot these values to the chart.

![image](images/Data-structures-How-do-i-create-and-use-arrays-in-pine-script-1.SP394-6D_ZkAgVX.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Array demo", overlay = true)
// Create an input to determine the number of session opens to track, with a default value of 5.
int numOpensInput = input.int(5, "Number of opens to track")
// Create an array to store open prices. Using `var` ensures the array retains its values from bar to bar.
// Initially, the array is filled with placeholder values (`na`), which are later updated with actual open prices.
var array<float> opensArray = array.new<float>(numOpensInput)
// On the first bar of each session, update the array: add the current open price and remove the oldest entry.
if session.isfirstbar_regular
    array.push(opensArray, open)
    array.shift(opensArray)
// Plot the highest, lowest, and average open prices from the tracked sessions
plot(array.max(opensArray), "Highest open in n sessions",       color.lime)
plot(array.min(opensArray), "Lowest open in n sessions",        color.fuchsia)
plot(array.avg(opensArray), "Avg. open of the last n sessions", color.gray)
// Change the background color on the first bar of each session to visually indicate session starts.
bgcolor(session.isfirstbar_regular ? color.new(color.gray, 80) : na)
```

For more information about arrays, see the [Arrays](#arrays) page in the User Manual.

## [What's the difference between an array declared with or without `var`?](https://www.tradingview.com#whats-the-difference-between-an-array-declared-with-or-without-var)

Using the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_var) keyword, a script can declare an [array](#arrays) variable in a script that is initialized only once, during the first iteration on the first chart bar.

**Persistent arrays**

When an array is declared with [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_var), it is initialized only once, at the first execution of the script. This allows the array to retain its contents and potentially grow in size across bars, making it ideal for cumulative data collection or tracking values over time.

**Non-persistent arrays**

Arrays declared without [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_var) are reinitialized on every new bar, effectively resetting their content. This behavior suits scenarios where calculations are specific to the current bar, and historical data retention is unnecessary.

**Example script**

Here, we initialize two arrays. Array `a` is declared without using the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_var) keyword, while array `b`
is declared with [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_var), allowing us to observe and compare their behavior. Throughout the runtime, we incrementally add an element to
each array on each bar. We use a [table](#tables) to present and compare both the sizes of these arrays and the number of chart bars, effectively illustrating the impact of
different declaration methods on array behavior:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Using `var` with arrays")
//@variable An array that initializes on every bar.
a = array.new<float>()
array.push(a, close)
//@variable An array that expands its size by 1 on each bar.
var b = array.new<float>(0)
array.push(b, close)
// Populate a table on the chart's last bar to display the sizes of the arrays and compare it to the number of chart bars.
if barstate.islast
    var table displayTable = table.new(position.middle_right, 2, 3)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 0, "Array A size:",             text_color = chart.fg_color, text_halign = text.align_right)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 0, str.tostring(a.size()),      text_color = chart.fg_color, text_halign = text.align_left)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 1, "Array B size:",             text_color = chart.fg_color, text_halign = text.align_right)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 1, str.tostring(b.size()),      text_color = chart.fg_color, text_halign = text.align_left)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 2, "Number of chart bars:",     text_color = chart.fg_color, text_halign = text.align_right)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 2, str.tostring(bar_index + 1), text_color = chart.fg_color, text_halign = text.align_left)
```

**Results**

- **Array A (Non-Persistent):** This array is reset at the beginning of each new bar. As a result, despite adding elements on each bar, its size remains constant, reflecting only the most recent addition.
- **Array B (Persistent):** This array retains its elements and accumulates new entries across bars, mirroring the growing count of chart bars. This persistent nature of the array shows its ability to track or aggregate data over the script's runtime.

For further details, consult the sections concerning variable
[declaration modes](#declaration-modes) and their use in
[array declarations](#using-var-and-varip-keywords) in the User Manual.

## [What are queues and stacks?](https://www.tradingview.com#what-are-queues-and-stacks)

Scripts can use [arrays](#arrays) to create [queues](#using-an-array-as-a-queue) and [stacks](#using-an-array-as-a-stack).

**Stacks**

A stack uses the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added item is the first to be taken away.
Think of this like a stack of plates, where you can only place a new plate on top or remove the top plate. To use an array as a stack, add elements to the end of the array using [array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push) and remove elements from the end of the array using [array.pop()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.pop).

**Queues**

A queue uses the "first in, first out" (FIFO) principle, where the first item to be added is the first to be removed. This kind of queue in code is like a queue in real life, such as in a coffee shop, where no matter how many people join the end of the queue, the first person still gets served first. To use an array as a queue, add elements to the end of the array using [array.push()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push) and remove them from the beginning using [array.shift()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.shift).

Stacks are particularly useful for accessing the most recent data, such as for tracking price levels. Queues are used for sequential data processing tasks, like event handling. Two example scripts follow, to illustrate these different usages.

**Example: Arrays as stacks**

This script uses arrays as stacks to manage pivot points. It draws [lines](#lines) from the pivot points and extends the lines with each new bar until price intersects them.
When the script detects a pivot point, it adds (pushes) a new line to the stack. With each new bar, the script extends the end point of each line in the stack.
It then checks whether price has intersected the high or low pivot lines at the top of the stack. If so, the script removes (pops) the intersected line from the stack, meaning that it will no longer be extended with new bars.
Note that we do not need to iterate through the arrays to check all the lines, because price is always between only the high and low pivot lines at the end of each array.

![image](images/Data-structures-What-does-queue-stack-mean-1.DR_kqOoE_WYIys.png)

```
//@version=6

// @function                Adds a new horizontal line to an array of lines at a specified pivot level.
// @param id                (array<line>) The array to which to add the new line.
// @param pivot             (float) The price level at which to draw the horizontal line.

//                          if false, remove bearish pivot line above the low price.
// @returns                 (void) The function has no explicit return.
removeLines(array<line> id, bool isBull) =>
    if array.size(id) > 0
        float linePrice = line.get_price(array.last(id), bar_index)
        if isBull ? high > linePrice : low < linePrice
            array.pop(id)
    line(na)

// Find the pivot high and pivot low prices.
float pivotLo = ta.pivotlow(10,  10), float pivotHi = ta.pivothigh(10, 10)

// Initialize two arrays on the first bar to stack our lines in.
var array<line> pivotHiArray = array.new<line>()
var array<line> pivotLoArray = array.new<line>()

// If a pivot occurs, draw a line from the pivot to the current bar and add the line to the stack.
stackLine(pivotHiArray, pivotHi, color.orange)
stackLine(pivotLoArray, pivotLo, color.aqua)

// Extend all lines in each array to the current bar on each bar.
extendLines(pivotHiArray)
extendLines(pivotLoArray)

// Check the final element of each array to see if price exceeded the pivot lines.
// Pop the line off the stack if it was exceeded.
removeLines(pivotHiArray, true)
removeLines(pivotLoArray, false)
```

**Example: Arrays as queues**

This script uses arrays as queues to track pivot points for monitoring recent support and resistance levels. It dynamically updates [lines](#lines) extending from the four most recent pivot highs and lows to the current bar with each new bar. When the script detects a new pivot high or low, it adds a line that represents this pivot to the respective queue.
To maintain the queue's size at a constant four items, the script removes the oldest line in the queue whenever it adds a new line.

## [How can I perform operations on all elements in an array?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-perform-operations-on-all-elements-in-an-array)

In Pine Script™, there are no built-in functions to apply operations across the entire array at once. Instead, scripts need to iterate through the array, performing the operation on each element one at a time.

The easiest way to retrieve each element in an array is by using a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) structure. This type of loop retrieves each element in turn, without the need for specifying the number of iterations.

The simple form of the loop has the format `for element in array`, where `element` is a variable that is assigned the current array element being accessed.

If the script's logic requires the position of the element in the array, use the two-argument form: `for [index, element] in array`. This form returns both the current element and its index in a [tuple](#tuples).

**Example: retrieving array elements**

This first example script uses an array as a [queue](#using-an-array-as-a-queue) to store [lines](#lines) representing the latest four pivot highs and lows. The [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop performs two tasks:

- It adjusts the `x2` endpoint of each line to the current [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).
- It changes the colors of the lines to blue for support or orange for resistance, based on their position relative to the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  price.

Note that neither of these operations requires knowing the index of the array element.

**Example: retrieving array elements and indices**

In our second script, we use the two-argument variant of the [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for...in) loop to access elements and their indices in an array.
This method facilitates operations that depend on element indices, such as managing parallel arrays or incorporating index values into calculations.
The script pairs a boolean array with an array of positive and negative random integers. The boolean array flags whether each corresponding integer in the primary array is positive.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example: `for...in` loop with index")
// Create an array of random integers above and below 0.
var valuesArray = array.from(4, -8, 11, 78, -16, 34, 7, 99, 0, 55)
// Create an array to track the positive state of each integer.
var isPos = array.new_bool(10, false)

// Iterate over the valuesArray using a `for...in` loop and update each corresponding element in the bool array to true
// if the value is above 0, or false if it is below 0.
for [i, eachValue] in valuesArray
    if eachValue > 0
        array.set(isPos, i, true)

// Print both arrays in a label on the last historical bar.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    label.new(bar_index +1, high, str.tostring(valuesArray) + "\n" + str.tostring(isPos), style = label.style_label_left, textcolor = chart.fg_color)
```

## [What's the most efficient way to search an array?](https://www.tradingview.com#whats-the-most-efficient-way-to-search-an-array)

The obvious way to search for an element in an array is to use a [loop](#loops) to check each element in turn.
However, there are more efficient ways to search, which can be useful in different situations.
Some of the following functions return only the index of a value. Programmers can then use [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get) if the script needs the actual value.

### [Checking if a value is present in an array](https://www.tradingview.com#checking-if-a-value-is-present-in-an-array)

If all the script needs to do is to check whether a certain value is present in an array or not, use the [array.includes()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.includes) function.
If the element is found, the function returns [true](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_true); otherwise, it returns [false](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_false).
This method does not return the index of the element.

The following example script checks if the value `3` is present in the `values` array, and displays either "found" or "not found" in a [label](#labels).

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example: Find whether an array element is present")
array<int> values = array.from(1, 3, 5)
int searchValue = input(3, "Value to Search For")
bool valuePresent = array.includes(values, searchValue)
if barstate.islast
    label.new(bar_index, low, valuePresent ? "Search value found" : "Search value not found", textcolor = color.white)
```

### [Finding the position of an element](https://www.tradingview.com#finding-the-position-of-an-element)

If the script requires the *position* of an element, programmers can use the [array.indexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.indexof) function.
This function returns the index of the *first* occurrence of a value within an array. If the value is not found, the function returns `-1`.
This method does not show whether there are multiple occurrences of the search value in the array. Depending on the script logic, this method might not be suitable if the array contains values that are not unique.

The following script searches for the first occurrence of `101.2` in the `prices` array and displays "found" and the value's index in a label, or "not found" otherwise.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example: Find index of array element")
array<float> prices = array.from(100.5, 101.2, 102.8, 100.5)
float searchValue = input(101.2, "Value to Search For")
int indexFound = array.indexof(prices, searchValue)
if barstate.islast
    string lblString = switch
        indexFound < 0 => "Search value: not found"
        =>                "Search value: found\n       Index: " + str.tostring(indexFound)
    label.new(bar_index, high, lblString,
         textcolor        = color.white,
         textalign        = text.align_left,
         text_font_family = font.family_monospace
     )
```

### [Binary search](https://www.tradingview.com#binary-search)

If the script requires the position of the element in a sorted array, the function [array.binary_search()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.binary_search) returns the index of a value more efficiently than [array.indexof()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.indexof). The performance improvement is significant for large arrays. If the value is not found, the function returns `-1`.

This script uses a binary search to find the value `100.5` within an array of prices. The script displays the original array, the sorted array, the target value (100.5), and the result of the search.
If the value is found, it displays "found", along with the index of the value. If the value is not found, it displays "not found".

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example: Binary search in sorted array")
array<float> sortedPrices = array.from(100.5, 102.3, 98.7, 99.2)
string originalArrayString = str.tostring(sortedPrices)
float searchValue = input(100.5)
// Ensure that the array is sorted (order is ascending by default); this step is crucial for binary search.
array.sort(sortedPrices)
string sortedArrayString = str.tostring(sortedPrices)
int searchValueIndex = array.binary_search(sortedPrices, searchValue)
bool valueFound = searchValueIndex >= 0
if barstate.islast
    string lblTxt =
     str.format("Original array: {0}\n  Sorted Array: {1}\n  Search value: {2}\n   Value found: {3}\n      Position: {4}",
         originalArrayString,
         sortedArrayString,
         searchValue,
         valueFound,
         searchValueIndex
     )
    label.new(bar_index, high, lblTxt,
         textcolor        = color.white,
         textalign        = text.align_left,
         text_font_family = font.family_monospace
     )
```

If a script does not need the exact value, the functions [array.binary_search_leftmost()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.binary_search_leftmost) and [array.binary_search_rightmost()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.binary_search_rightmost) provide an effective way to locate the nearest index to a given value in sorted arrays.
These functions return the index of the value, if it is present. If the value is not present, they return the index of the element that is closest to the search value on the left (smaller) or right (larger) side.

## [How can I debug arrays?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-debug-arrays)

To debug arrays, scripts need to display the contents of the array at certain points in the script.
Techniques that can display the contents of arrays include using plots, labels, tables, and Pine Logs.

For information about commonly encountered array-related errors, refer to the array [Error Handling](#error-handling) section in the User Manual.

### [Plotting](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting)

Using the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function to inspect the contents of an array can be helpful because this function can show numerical values on the script's status line, the price
scale, and the Data Window. It is also easy to review historical values.

Limitations of this approach include:

- Arrays must be of type ["float"](#float) or ["int"](#int).
- The number of plots used for debugging counts towards the [plot limit for a script](#plot-count-limit).
- Plot calls must be in the global scope and scripts cannot call them conditionally. Therefore, if the size of the array varies across bars, using this technique can be impractical.

Here we populate an array with the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) (OHLC) prices on each bar. The script retrieves all the elements of the array and plots them on the chart.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plot array elements")
array<float> ohlc = array.from(open, high, low, close)
plot(ohlc.get(0), "Open",  color.red)
plot(ohlc.get(1), "High",  color.yellow)
plot(ohlc.get(2), "Low",   color.blue)
plot(ohlc.get(3), "Close", color.green)
```

### [Using labels](https://www.tradingview.com#using-labels)

Using [labels](#labels) to display array values on certain bars is particularly useful for non-continuous data points or to view all elements of an array simultaneously.
Scripts can create labels within any local scope, including [functions](#user-defined-functions) and [methods](#user-defined-methods). Scripts can also position drawings at any available chart location, irrespective of the current [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).
Unlike plots, labels can display the contents of a variety of array types, including boolean and string arrays.

Limitations of using labels include:

- Pine labels display only in the chart pane.
- Scripts can display only up to a [maximum number of labels](#line-box-polyline-and-label-limits).

In the following example script, we monitor the close price at the last four moving average (MA) crosses in a queued array and use a label to display this array from a local scope whenever a cross occurs:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Array elements in a label", overlay = true)

var array<float> crossPrices = array.new<float>(4)

float fastMa = ta.ema(close, 9)
float slowMa = ta.ema(close, 21)

if ta.cross(fastMa, slowMa)
    crossPrices.push(close)
    crossPrices.shift()
    label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(crossPrices), textcolor = color.white)

plot(fastMa, "Fast MA", color.aqua)
plot(slowMa, "Slow MA", color.orange)
```

For more information, see the [debugging with labels](#using-labels) section in the User Manual.

### [Using label tooltips](https://www.tradingview.com#using-label-tooltips)

If programmers want to be able to inspect the values in an array on every bar, displaying the contents of the array in a label is not convenient, because the labels overlap and become difficult to read.
In this case, displaying the array contents in a label tooltip can be visually clearer. This method has the same advantages and limitations as [using labels](#using-labels) in the section above.

This example script plots a fast and a slow moving average (MA). It maintains one array of the most recent three values of the fast MA, and one array for the slow MA. The script prints empty labels on each bar.
The tooltip shows the values of the MA arrays and whether or not the MAs crossed this bar. The labels are displayed in a semi-transparent color, and the tooltip is visible only when the cursor hovers over the label.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Array elements in a label tooltip", overlay = true)

// Create two arrays to hold the MA values.
var array<float> fastMaValues = array.new<float>(3)
var array<float> slowMaValues = array.new<float>(3)

// Calculate the MAs.
float fastMa = ta.ema(close, 9)
float slowMa = ta.ema(close, 21)

// Load the current MA values into the arrays.
fastMaValues.push(math.round(fastMa,2)), slowMaValues.push(math.round(slowMa,2))
// Remove the first element to keep the arrays at the same size.
fastMaValues.shift(),  slowMaValues.shift()
// Define the string to print in the label tooltip.
string labelString = str.format("Fast MA array: {0}\n  Slow MA array: {1}\n  Crossed this bar? {2}",
  str.tostring(fastMaValues),
  str.tostring(slowMaValues),
  ta.cross(fastMa, slowMa))
//Print the labels.
label.new(bar_index, high, text="", color=color.new(chart.fg_color,90), textcolor = chart.fg_color, tooltip=labelString)

plot(fastMa, "Fast MA", color.aqua)
plot(slowMa, "Slow MA", color.orange)
```

### [Using tables](https://www.tradingview.com#using-tables)

Using [tables](#tables) for debugging offers a more organized and scalable alternative to labels. Tables can display multiple ["series"](#series) strings in a clear format that remains unaffected by the chart's scale or the index of the bars.

Limitations of using tables for debugging include that, unlike labels, the state of a table can only be viewed from the most recent script execution, making it hard to view historical data.
Additionally, tables are computationally more expensive than other debugging methods and can require more code.

In the following example script, we create and display two unrelated arrays, to show how flexible this approach can be. The first array captures the times of the last six bars where a Golden Cross occurred. The second array records the last eight bar indices where the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reached new all-time highs within the chart's history. We use the `whenSince()` function from the PineCoders' [getSeries](https://www.tradingview.com/script/Bn7QkdZR-getSeries/) library to create and update the arrays. This function treats the arrays as [queues](#using-an-array-as-a-queue), and limits their size.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Debugging arrays with tables", overlay = true)

// Import the `getSeries` PineCoders library to build fixed-size arrays populated on specific conditions.
//      https://www.tradingview.com/v/Bn7QkdZR/
import PineCoders/getSeries/1 as PCgs

// Calculate MAs and create cross condition.
float ma50        = ta.sma(close,  50)
float ma200       = ta.sma(close,  200)
bool  goldenCross = ta.cross(ma50, ma200)

// Calculate the RSI and determine if it's hitting a new all-time high.
float myRsi       = ta.rsi(close,  20)
bool newRsiAth    = myRsi == ta.max(myRsi)

// Create two arrays using the imported `whenSince()` function.
array<float> goldenCrossesTimes = PCgs.whenSince(time_close, goldenCross, length = 6)
array<float> barIndicesOfHiRSIs = PCgs.whenSince(bar_index,  newRsiAth,   length = 8)

// Plot the MAs for cross reference.
plot(ma50,  "50 MA",  color.aqua)
plot(ma200, "200 MA", color.orange)

// On the last historical bar, display the date and time of the last crosses.
if barstate.islast
    // Declare our MA table to display the Golden Cross times. 
    var table maTable  = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 8, color.new(color.black, 100), color.gray, 1, color.gray, 1)
    // Create a title cell for the MA table and merge cells to form a banner two cells wide.
    table.cell(maTable , 0, 0, "Golden Cross Times", text_color = color.black, bgcolor = #FFD700)
    table.merge_cells(maTable , 0, 0, 1, 0)
    // Loop the array and write cells to the MA table containing the cross time for each element of the array. Number each element in the left row.
    // Format the UNIX time value to a formatted time string using `str.format_time()`.
    for [i, timeValue] in goldenCrossesTimes
        table.cell(maTable, 0, i + 1, str.tostring(i + 1), text_color = #FFD700)
        table.cell(maTable, 1, i + 1, str.format_time(int(timeValue), "yyyy.MM.dd 'at' HH:mm:ss z"), text_color = chart.fg_color)
    // Create a second table to display the indices of the last eight RSI all-time highs.
    var table rsiTable = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.new(color.black, 100), color.gray, 1, color.gray, 1)
    table.cell(rsiTable, 0, 0, "Bar indices of RSI ATHs\n" + str.tostring(barIndicesOfHiRSIs), text_color = chart.fg_color)
```

### [Using Pine Logs](https://www.tradingview.com#using-pine-logs)

[Pine Logs](#pine-logs) are messages that display in the Pine Logs pane, along with a timestamp when the logging function was called.
Scripts can create log messages at specific points during the execution of a script. Pine Logs can display any script values or variables at any part of your code, including [local scopes](#local-drawings-and-logs), [functions](#debugging-functions), and [loops](#debugging-loops).

By logging messages to the console whenever there is a modification to the array, programmers can track the logical flow of array operations in much more detail than by using other approaches.

The script below updates a previous example script from the section on [queues and stacks](#what-are-queues-and-stacks) to add logging. It uses arrays as [stacks](#using-an-array-as-a-stack) to track lines drawn from pivot points. When a pivot occurs, the script adds a new line to the stack and continues to extend the lines on each bar until an intersection with price occurs. If an intersection is found, the script removes (pops) the intersected line from the stack, meaning it will no longer be extended with new bars.

The [console messages](#creating-logs) are time stamped and offer detailed information about when elements are added to and removed from the arrays, the current size of the arrays, and the specific prices at which elements were added.

## [Can I use matrices or multidimensional arrays in Pine Script™?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-use-matrices-or-multidimensional-arrays-in-pine-script)

Pine Script™ does not directly support multidimensional arrays; however, it provides [matrices](#matrices) and [user-defined types](#user-defined-types) (UDTs).
Programmers can use these data structures to create and manipulate complex datasets.

**Matrices**

Pine Script [matrices](#matrices) are like two-dimensional arrays. They organize data in a rectangular grid, facilitating operations like transformations, linear algebra, and other complex calculations. They are particularly useful for quantitative modeling, such as portfolio optimization, correlation matrix analysis, and more.
Just as in [arrays](#arrays), all elements in a matrix must be of the same [type](#types), which can be a built-in or a [user-defined](#user-defined-types) type. Pine Script™ provides a range of functions for [manipulating](#manipulating-a-matrix) and performing [calculations](#matrix-calculations) on matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.

**Using UDTs for multidimensional structures**

Programmers can achieve similar functionality to multidimensional arrays through defining [user-defined types](#user-defined-types) (UDTs). For example, a script can define a UDT that includes an array as one of its fields. UDTs themselves can be contained in arrays. In this way, scripts can effectively have arrays of arrays.

For more information, see the sections on [Matrices](#matrices), [Maps](#maps), and [Objects](#objects) in the User Manual.

## [How can I debug objects?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-debug-objects)

To debug [objects](#objects), create custom functions that break down an object into its constituent fields and convert these fields into strings.
See the [Debugging](#debugging) section of the User Manual for information about methods to display debug information.
In particular, [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) can display extensive and detailed debug information. See the FAQ section about debugging arrays [using Pine Logs](http://localhost:4321/pine-script-docs/faq/data-structures/#using-pine-logs) for an explanation of using logs for debugging.

In our example script, we create a [user-defined type](#user-defined-types) (UDT) named `openLine`, which includes fields such as `price`, `openTime`, and a line object called `level`.
On the first bar of each session, the script initializes a new `openLine` instance. This object tracks the session's opening price and time, and it draws a line at the open price, extending from the session's start to
its close. An array stores each `openLine` object. A custom function `debugOpenLine()` breaks an `openLine` object into its individual fields, converts the fields to strings, and then logs a message that displays these strings in the console.

## [Can I use a variable length in functions?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-use-a-variable-length-in-functions)

Many [built-in](#built-in-functions) technical analysis (TA) functions have a `length` parameter, such as `ta.sma(source, length)`.
A majority of these functions can process "[series](#series)" lengths, i.e., lengths that can change from bar to bar.
Some functions, however, only accept "[simple](#simple)" integer lengths, which must be known on bar zero and not change during the execution of the script.

Check the Reference Manual entry for a function to see what type of values a function can process.

**Additional resources**

For more advanced versions of functions that support "series" lengths, or for extra technical analysis tools explore the [ta library](https://www.tradingview.com/script/BICzyhq0-ta/) on the TradingView profile.
This library offers a range of extended TA-related capabilities and custom implementations.

**User-defined functions**

For built-in functions that do not accept "series" lengths and for which the functionality is not available in the [ta library](https://www.tradingview.com/script/BICzyhq0-ta/), consider creating a [user-defined function](#user-defined-functions).

## [How can I calculate values depending on variable lengths that reset on a condition?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-calculate-values-depending-on-variable-lengths-that-reset-on-a-condition)

To calculate certain values that are dependent on varying lengths, which also reset under specific conditions, the [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince)
function can be useful.
This function counts the number of bars since the last occurrence of a specified condition, automatically resetting the count each time this condition is met.
There are, however, some considerations to take into account when using this function for this purpose.

Firstly, before the condition is met for the first time in a chart's history, [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na). This value is not usable as a length for functions and can cause errors, especially during execution on a chart's early bars.
For a more robust version, use [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) to replace the [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) return of [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) with zero for early bars.

Secondly, when the condition is met, [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) returns zero for that bar, since zero bars have elapsed since the condition was last true.

Since lengths cannot be zero, it is necessary to add one to a returned value of zero, ensuring that the length is always at least one.

Here's an example of how to use these principles for a practical purpose. The following example script calculates the highest and lowest price points since the start of a new day.
We use [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change) to detect the start of a new day, which is our condition.
The [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) function calculates the number of bars that elapsed since this condition was last met.
The script passes this number, or "lookback", to the [ta.lowest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.lowest) and [ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest)
functions, which determine the highest and lowest points since the start of the new day:

![image](images/Functions-How-can-i-calculate-values-depending-on-variable-lengths-that-reset-on-a-condition-1.BG9cnL10_Z2jJ0Tt.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Highest/lowest since new day", "", true)

// Identify the start of a new day and calculate the number of bars since then.
bool newDay  = timeframe.change("D")
int lookback = nz(ta.barssince(newDay)) + 1

// Calculate the highest and lowest point since the new day began.
float lowestSinceNewDay  = ta.lowest(lookback)
float highestSinceNewDay = ta.highest(lookback)

// Plot the high/low level since the start of a new day.
plot(lowestSinceNewDay, "High today", color.orange)
plot(highestSinceNewDay, "Low today", color.aqua)
// Change the background color to indicate the start of a new day.
bgcolor(newDay ? color.new(color.gray, 80) : na)
// Display the varying lookback period in Data Window.
plot(lookback, "Lookback", display = display.data_window)
```

## [How can I round a number to x increments?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-round-a-number-to-x-increments)

Rounding numbers to specific increments is useful for tasks like calculating levels for grid trading, dealing with fractional shares, or aligning trading parameters to specific pip values.

In this example, the `roundToIncrement()` function accepts a value and an increment as parameters. It divides the value by the increment, rounds the result, then multiplies it by the increment to give the rounded value.
To demonstrate the function, the closing price is rounded to the nearest increment defined in the user menu:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Round to x increment demo", overlay = true)

float incrementInput = input.float(0.75, "Increment", step = 0.25)

// @function                Rounds a value to the nearest multiple of a specified increment.
// @param value             The value to round.
// @param increment         The increment to round the value to.
// @returns                 The rounded value.
roundToIncrement(value, increment) =>
    math.round(value / increment) * increment

plot(series = roundToIncrement(close, incrementInput), color = chart.fg_color)
```

## [How can I control the precision of values my script displays?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-control-the-precision-of-values-my-script-displays)

The `precision` and `format` arguments in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy)
declaration statement control the number of decimals in the values that a script displays.

By default, scripts use the precision of the price scale. To display more decimal places, specify a `precision` argument that exceeds the value of the current price scale.

## [How can I control the precision of values used in my calculations?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-control-the-precision-of-values-used-in-my-calculations)

The `math.round(number, precision)` variation of the [math.round()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.round) function rounds values according to a specified precision.
Alternatively, the [math.round_to_mintick()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.round_to_mintick) function rounds values to the nearest tick precision of the chart's symbol.

## [How can I round to ticks?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-round-to-ticks)

To round values to the tick precision of a chart's symbol, use the function [math.round_to_mintick()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.round_to_mintick).
To convert the resulting number to a string, use `str.tostring(myValue, format.mintick)` to first round the number to tick precision and then return its string representation, where `myValue` is the number to convert into a rounded string.

## [How can I abbreviate large values?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-abbreviate-large-values)

There are different ways to abbreviate large numerical values, such as volume. For instance, the number 1,222,333.0 can be simplified to 1.222M.
Here are some methods to accomplish this:

**Apply a global setting**

Use the argument `format = format.volume` within either the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) statements. Using this setting, displays all values in the script in their abbreviated forms.

**Abbreviate specific values**

To abbreviate only certain values for string display, use the `str.tostring(value, format.volume)` function.

**Use a custom function**

To specify a custom precision or abbreviate values up to trillions, use a custom function. In the following example script, the [user-defined function](#user-defined-functions)`abbreviateValue()` divides the `value` by a power of ten based on its magnitude, and adds an abbreviation letter (K, M, B, or T) to represent the magnitude of the original value.
The function also adds a subtle space between the value and the magnitude letter. The `print()` function displays the value on the chart for visualization.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Value abbreviation example")

// @function            Converts a numeric value into a readable string representation featuring the appropriate order
//                          of magnitude abbreviation (K, M, B, T).
// @param value         (float) The value to format.
// @param precision         (string) The numerical precision of the result. ("" for none, ".00" for two digits, etc.)
// @returns                 (string) The formatted value as a string with the appropriate abbreviation suffix.
abbreviateValue(float value, string precision) =>
    float digitsAmt = math.log10(math.abs(value))
    string formatPrecision = "#" + precision
    string result = switch
        digitsAmt > 12 => str.tostring(value / 1e12, formatPrecision + "  T")
        digitsAmt > 9  => str.tostring(value / 1e9,  formatPrecision + "  B")
        digitsAmt > 6  => str.tostring(value / 1e6,  formatPrecision + "  M")
        digitsAmt > 3  => str.tostring(value / 1e3,  formatPrecision + "  K")
        =>                str.tostring(value, "#" +  formatPrecision)

print(formattedString) =>
    var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, formattedString, bgcolor = color.yellow)

print(abbreviateValue(volume, ".00"))
```

## [How can I calculate using pips?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-calculate-using-pips)

Use the custom function `calcBaseUnit()` in the following example script to return the correct pip value for Forex symbols, or the base unit of change for non-forex symbols:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Pip calculation example")

// @function            Calculates the chart symbol's base unit of change in asset prices.
// @returns             (float) A ticks or pips value of base units of change.
calcBaseUnit() =>
    bool isForexSymbol = syminfo.type         == "forex"
    bool isYenQuote    = syminfo.currency     == "JPY"
    bool isYenBase     = syminfo.basecurrency == "JPY"
    float result = isForexSymbol ? isYenQuote ? 0.01 : isYenBase ? 0.00001 : 0.0001 : syminfo.mintick

// Call the function and plot the result in a label
var label baseUnitLabel = na
if barstate.islast
    baseUnitLabel := label.new(x=bar_index + 1, y=open, text="Base Unit: " + str.tostring(calcBaseUnit(), "#.######"), 
      style=label.style_label_left, color=color.new(color.blue, 0), textcolor=color.white)
    label.delete(baseUnitLabel[1])
```

## [How do I calculate averages?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-calculate-averages)

The method of calculating averages depends on the type of values to average.

**Distinct variables**

To find the average of a small number of discrete variables, use the function [math.avg(number0, number1, …)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.avg).
Simply pass each of the variables as an argument to this function.

**Bar prices**

To find the average price of a single bar, use the built-in variables [hl2](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hl2), [hlc3](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_hlc3), and [ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4).

**Series values**

To compute the average of the last *n* values in a series, use the function [ta.sma(series,n)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma).

**Custom datasets**

To average a custom set of values, organize them into an [array](#arrays) and use [array.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg). For complex datasets, programmers can use the [matrix.avg()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_matrix.avg) function to average the contents of a matrix. For a deeper understanding of averaging custom datasets, refer to  this [conditional averages](https://www.tradingview.com/script/9l0ZpuQU-ConditionalAverages/) publication.

## [How can I calculate an average only when a certain condition is true?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-calculate-an-average-only-when-a-certain-condition-is-true)

The usual methods of calculating averages, which were discussed in the [calculating averages section](#how-do-i-calculate-averages) above, apply across *all* data points in a range.
To calculate averages of only those values that occur under specific conditions, calculate *conditional averages* using custom functions.

The example script below imports a [library](#libraries) called [ConditionalAverages](https://www.tradingview.com/script/9l0ZpuQU-ConditionalAverages/) and uses two of its functions:

- The `avgWhen()` function calculates the average volume of session opening bars across the entire dataset.
- The `avgWhenLast()` function averages the opening volumes for the last five session opening bars.

The condition for these conditional averages is *session opening bars*, which we determine using the [session.isfirstbar_regular](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_session.isfirstbar_regular) variable.

![image](images/Functions-How-can-i-calculate-an-average-only-when-a-certain-condition-is-true-1.zmzMnsL2_2dPpkK.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Average session opening volume")

import PineCoders/ConditionalAverages/1 as PCca

// Color aqua for the session's opening bar, otherwise distinct colors for up/down volume columns.
color volumeColor = switch
    session.isfirstbar_regular => color.aqua
    close > open               => color.new(#D1D4DC, 65)
    =>                            color.new(#787B86, 65)

// Plot the volume columns.
plot(volume, "volume", volumeColor, 4, plot.style_histogram)
// Average volume over *all* session opening bars in the dataset.
plot(PCca.avgWhen(src = volume, cond = session.isfirstbar_regular), "avg. When", #FF00FF)
// Average volume over the last five opening bars.
plot(PCca.avgWhenLast(src = volume, cond = session.isfirstbar_regular, cnt = 5), "avgWhenInLast()", #00FF00)
```

## [How can I generate a random number?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-generate-a-random-number)

Use the [math.random()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.random) function to generate random numbers.
This example script creates a circle plot with random RGB color values and a random y value between 0 and 1:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Random demo", overlay = false)

// Generate a random price value (the default range is 0 to 1).
float y = math.random()
// Generate a color with red, green, and blue values as separate random values between 0 and 255.
color plotColor = color.rgb(math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255))
plot(series = y, title = "Random number", color = plotColor, linewidth = 2, style = plot.style_circles)
```

## [How can I evaluate a filter I am planning to use?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-evaluate-a-filter-i-am-planning-to-use)

To evaluate a filter, insert your filter code into the [Filter Information Box - PineCoders FAQ](https://www.tradingview.com/script/oTEP9DJF-Filter-Information-Box-PineCoders-FAQ/) script.
This script conducts an impulse response analysis and shows the filter's characteristics in a label on the chart.

For further details and a guide on integrating your filter into the code, refer to the publication's description.

## [What does nz() do?](https://www.tradingview.com#what-does-nz-do)

The [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) function replaces any [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values with zero, or with a user-defined value if the `replacement` argument is specified. This function helps to prevent [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values from interfering with calculations.

The following example script shows an exaggerated failure as a result of a single [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value. The `barRangeRaw` variable is [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) only once, on the first bar, because it references a bar that does not exist, using the history-referencing operator. The alternative variable `barRangeWithNz` uses [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) to prevent an [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value from ever occurring.

The `dependentCalculation` variable takes one of these values and uses it to calculate a crude average of the bar range.
If the input to this calculation is ever [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), the series will be [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) forever after that.

Choose between the two values for bar range using the input setting, and the range either displays or not. In the latter case, the Data Window shows that the value of `dependentCalculation` is `ϴ`, meaning [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

```
//@version=6
indicator("`na` values on first bar demo")

bool useNzInput = input.bool(true, "Use `nz` to ensure value is never na")

// This variable is na on the first bar.
float barRangeRaw = close - close[1]
// This variable is never na.
float barRangeWithNz = close - nz(close[1], open)
// Choose the value to use based on the input
float barRange = useNzInput ? barRangeWithNz : barRangeRaw

// Perform a calculation that depends on the barRange
var float dependentCalculation = 0
dependentCalculation := ((dependentCalculation + barRange)/2)
// Plot the results
plot(dependentCalculation, title="Average Bar Range")
```

The [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) function is also useful to protect against any potential divide-by-zero errors. It guarantees a return value even when an equation unintentionally features a zero in the denominator. Consider the following code snippet that intentionally creates a divide-by-zero
scenario by setting the denominator to zero. Without the [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz) function, this expression would return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na),
instead of zero:

```
float dbzTest = nz(close / (close - close))
```

# [Indicators](https://www.tradingview.com#indicators)

## [Can I create an indicator that plots like the built-in Volume or Volume Profile indicators?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-create-an-indicator-that-plots-like-the-built-in-volume-or-volume-profile-indicators)

The [Volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volumestudies/?script_type=indicators&solution=43000591617) and [Visible Range Volume Profile](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volumestudies/?script_type=indicators&solution=43000703076) indicators (along with some other built-in indicators) are written in Java. They display data on the main chart pane in a unique way:

- The bars are anchored to the bottom or right edge of the chart, not to an absolute x or y value.
- The length of the bars is a relative percentage of the available space and is not an absolute price or number of bars.
- The length of the bars adjusts automatically according to the data from the range of bars that are visible on the chart. The lengths of the bars are normalized so as never to appear too small or too large.
- The width of the bars adjusts automatically to fit the visible space.

It is difficult for Pine Script™ indicators to plot values in the same way.

**Limitations of `plot.style_columns`**

[Volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume), or another series, plotted as columns, is anchored to the bottom of the chart, and the width and length of the bars can adjust dynamically. However, the tops of the bars are defined by absolute price values. This means that it is not possible for the series to be plotted on the main chart without distorting the price scale. Also, plots must be defined during processing of the bar they are plotted on, and cannot be plotted retroactively.

**Limitations of drawings**

Drawing objects such as [lines and boxes](#lines-and-boxes) are anchored to an absolute price scale, not to the edge of the chart. Drawing objects do not adjust their length automatically. Lines do not adjust their width automatically. Although boxes can be drawn exactly one bar wide, and so adjust their width automatically, they cannot be drawn so as to fit exactly in one bar; they always draw from the middle of one bar to the middle of another.

The following example script demonstrates some techniques for approximating the way that the built-in [Volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volumestudies/?script_type=indicators&solution=43000591617) indicator displays.

- We use the [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) and [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) built-in variables, through the PineCoders' [VisibleChart library](https://www.tradingview.com/script/j7vCseM2-VisibleChart/), to define the bars that are visible. Then we calculate the highest and lowest price, and the highest [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume), for that period.
- We plot lines retroactively, after the visible window and all related values are known.
- We anchor the lines below the lowest visible price, so that it looks as if they are anchored to the bottom edge of the chart.
- We scale the length of all the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) bars so that the longest bar in the set is approximately 30% of the screen height, similar to the built-in [Volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volumestudies/?script_type=indicators&solution=43000591617) indicator.
- We adjust the width of the lines depending on how many bars are visible.

This script has some other limitations:

- The lines do not begin from the bottom of the chart if other indicators display plots or drawings below that level.
- In common with any script that uses the [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) or [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) built-in variables, the script must refresh each time the chart is moved or a new bar appears.
- There is a maximum [limit](#line-box-polyline-and-label-limits) of 500 lines per script.
- The width of the lines is calculated based on how many bars are visible. However, a Pine script has no way of knowing how much blank space there is to the right of the final bar. If the user scrolls to the right, the lines can appear too wide and overlap each other.

## [Can I use a Pine script with the TradingView screener?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-use-a-pine-script-with-the-tradingview-screener)

The TradingView [screener](https://www.tradingview.com/screener/) uses only its built-in filters, and cannot use a Pine script.
[Search for "screener"](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/search/screener/) in the Community Collection to find scripts that use the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function to screen pre-set lists of symbols.

See also [this FAQ entry](#how-can-i-get-custom-alerts-on-many-symbols) for an example script that generates alerts on multiple
symbols.
Note that using several `request.security()` calls can cause scripts to compile and run more slowly than expected.

## [How can I use the output from one script as input to another?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-use-the-output-from-one-script-as-input-to-another)

Scripts with an input of type [input.source()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input.source) can take a plot from another script (up to a maximum of ten) as an input.
Select the script and plot to take as input in the script's "Settings" tab. If the user removes the script from the chart and adds it again, they must select the correct inputs again.

The sources used as external inputs must originate from indicators; they cannot originate from strategies. However, plots originating from indicators *can* be used in strategies.

For further information, refer to [this blog post](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/more-external-inputs-for-scripts-38014/) and the [Source input section](#source-input) in the User Manual.

## [Can my script draw on the main chart when it's running in a separate pane?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-my-script-draw-on-the-main-chart-when-its-running-in-a-separate-pane)

Scripts that have the `overlay` parameter in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) functions set to `false` appear in a separate pane to the main chart.
Such scripts can affect the display of the main chart in only two ways:

- Changing bar colors, using the [barcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_barcolor) function.
- Forcing plots to overlay, using `force_overlay = true` in the plotting function. The `force_overlay` parameter is available in most functions that draw on the chart.

## [Is it possible to export indicator data to a file?](https://www.tradingview.com#is-it-possible-to-export-indicator-data-to-a-file)

The option "Export chart data…" in the dropdown menu at the top right corner of the chart exports a comma-separated values (CSV) file that includes time, OHLC data, and any plots generated by your script. This option can also export strategy data.

To include specific information in the CSV file, ensure that it is plotted by the script.
If this extra information is far from the symbol's price and the existing indicator plots, and plotting it on the chart could distort the scale of the script, or if you prefer not to display
certain plots, consider using the `display` parameter in the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function.

Here is an example plot that displays the close only in the Data Window. The plot title "No chart display" becomes the column header for this value in the CSV file.

```
plot(close * 0.5, "No chart display", display = display.data_window)
```

Alternatively, the "Scale price chart only" in the chart settings maintains the script's scale. To access these settings, right-click on the chart's price scale.

To determine if a condition is true or false, use the [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) function, which records a 1 (for true) or 0 (for false) in the CSV file.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[FAQ](#faq)/Other data and timeframes

# [Other data and timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#other-data-and-timeframes)

## [What kinds of data can I get from a higher timeframe?](https://www.tradingview.com#what-kinds-of-data-can-i-get-from-a-higher-timeframe)

Generally speaking, the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function can get the same kinds of data from another timeframe that is available on the chart timeframe. Scripts can retrieve built-in variables like [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low), [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close), [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume), and [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).

The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function can also evaluate built-in or user-defined functions in the requested *context* (timeframe and symbol). For example, the following example script retrieves the [Average True Range](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000501823-average-true-range-atr/) (ATR) value from the daily (`1D`) timeframe by passing the [ta.atr()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.atr) function as the `expression` argument.

```
//@version=5
indicator("HTF ATR")
float higherTfAtr = request.security(symbol = syminfo.tickerid, timeframe = "1D", expression = ta.atr(14))
plot(higherTfAtr)
```

## [Which `security.*` function should I use for lower timeframes?](https://www.tradingview.com#which-security-function-should-i-use-for-lower-timeframes)

The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function is intended for accessing data at timeframes that are equal to or higher than the chart's current timeframe.
It is *possible* to retrieve data from lower timeframes (LTF) using this function. However, the function returns the value from only *one* LTF bar within the chart's current bar (the last bar, by default).

If the script supplies the `expression` as a variable or simple calculation, directly or within a function, the data that [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) returns from a lower timeframe is generally of limited use (see the first script in [this section](#how-can-i-plot-a-moving-average-only-when-the-charts-timeframe-is-1d-or-higher) for an example). It is possible, however, to construct a function that performs meaningful calculations on the LTF bars and then returns the result on the last bar. The following example script counts the number of LTF bars in a chart bar and returns this value on the last LTF bar. For simplicity, the timeframes are hardcoded to `"1D"` and `"1W"` and the script should therefore be run from a chart on the weekly timeframe.

```
//@version=5
indicator("Counting intrabars using `request.security()`")

// @function    Calculates the quantity of 1D bars in a week of trading.
// @returns     (int) The number of intrabars within the current weekly bar up to the current moment.
qtyIntrabars() =>
    var int count = 0
    count := timeframe.change("W") ? 1 : count + 1

int qtyIntrabars = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", qtyIntrabars())

plot(qtyIntrabars, "qtyIntrabars", style=plot.style_histogram)
```

When using the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function on a lower timeframe, all calculations that reference individual LTF bars must be done *within the requested context*, and only the *result* of the calculation is returned.
Using the [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) function for intrabar analysis is usually easier and more powerful, because it returns an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of data from *all* available intrabars within a chart bar. Returning the data for each bar allows scripts to perform calculations on specific bars or all bars in the main script context.

In the following version of our example script, we use [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) to perform the same calculations. With this approach, we do not need to explicitly define the current chart's timeframe, nor do we need a custom function.

```
//@version=5
indicator("Counting intrabars using `request.security_lower_tf()`")

// Count the number of elements in the array of close prices for each LTF bar in the current chart's bar.
int qtyIntrabars = array.size(request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close))

plot(qtyIntrabars, "qtyIntrabars", style=plot.style_histogram)
```

See the sections in the User Manual page "Other timeframes and Data" about
[`request.security_lower_tf()`](#lower-timeframes) and
using [`request.security()` on lower timeframes](#requestsecurity_lower_tf)
to learn more about the differences between running these functions on a lower timeframe.

## [How to avoid repainting when using the `request.security()` function?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-to-avoid-repainting-when-using-the-requestsecurity-function)

[Repainting](#repainting) can be a problem when retrieving data from higher or lower timeframes using [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security).

Retrieving data from a different symbol on the chart's timeframe does not risk repainting. Requesting data from the chart's own symbol and timeframe does not result in repainting either, but it is usually unnecessary to use [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) rather than simply referencing the chart's own values (except when modifying the chart's ticker using `ticker.*()` functions). When using the chart's timeframe, there is no need to offset the data, change the default `lookahead` value, or use [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_on) in order to avoid repainting.

### [Higher timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#higher-timeframes)

Values from a *higher timeframe* (HTF) often repaint because a [historical bar](#calculation-based-on-historical-bars) on the chart might include data from a [realtime bar](#calculation-based-on-realtime-bars) on the HTF. Realtime values can change throughout the bar; for example, the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) price reflects the *latest* price update in a realtime bar. When the HTF bar closes and its values become fixed, the relevant historical chart bars *change* to adjust to the fixed HTF values. This behavior is described in the [Historical and realtime behavior](#historical-and-realtime-behavior) section of the User Manual. Users expect historical bars not to change, which is one reason why repainting is such a concern.

To prevent repainting, use confirmed values that remain consistent across all bars. The most robust method is to offset all expressions by 1. For example, instead of `close`, which is equivalent to `close[0]`, use `close[1]`. The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call must also use [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_on).
This method returns data that is up to one HTF bar "late", and is thus not subject to change.

The following example script demonstrates the use of a single bar offset to the `expression` argument and [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_on) in [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) to ensure that the data behaves the same on historical and realtime bars.
The script triggers a [runtime error](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_runtime.error) if the chart's timeframe exceeds or matches the daily timeframe, to prevent the return of inaccurate values.

```
//@version=5
indicator("HTF close" , overlay = true)
float dailyClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
plot(dailyClose)
if timeframe.in_seconds() >= timeframe.in_seconds("1D")
    runtime.error("Chart timeframe must be less than 1D.")
```

See the [Avoiding repainting](#avoiding-repainting) section of the User Manual for more information.

### [Lower timeframes](https://www.tradingview.com#lower-timeframes)

Although the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function is intended to operate on timeframes greater than or equal to the chart timeframe, it *can* request data from a [lower timeframe](#lower-timeframes) (LTF), with limitations. When accessing data from a LTF, the function evaluates the given expression in the LTF context and returns the result from a *single* LTF bar per chart bar. The specific LTF bar returned depends on the [lookahead](#lookahead) parameter:

- [barmerge.lookahead_on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_on) returns the *first* intrabar of the period historically, but the *last* intrabar in realtime.
- [barmerge.lookahead_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_off) always returns the last intrabar for both historical and realtime data.
  To prevent [repainting](#repainting) (in this case, inconsistent results between realtime and historical data) use [barmerge.lookahead_off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_barmerge.lookahead_off) for lower timeframe data requests.

In most cases, using the [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) function is more suitable for lower timeframes, as it returns an
[array](#arrays) containing data from *all* available intrabars within a chart bar. See the section on [`request.security_lower_tf()`](#requestsecurity_lower_tf) to learn more.

## [How can I convert the chart's timeframe into a numeric format?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-convert-the-charts-timeframe-into-a-numeric-format)

The [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds) function converts a timeframe specified in [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) format into an equivalent number of seconds. Having the timeframe in a numeric format means that scripts can calculate the number of time units within a specific timeframe, or perform operations that adjust the timeframe used in HTF calls in relation to the chart's timeframe, as described in [this FAQ entry](#how-do-i-define-a-higher-timeframe-that-is-a-multiple-of-the-chart-timeframe).

In this script example, we use the [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds) function to determine the chart's timeframe, measured in seconds. Since no specific
`timeframe` argument is specified, the function defaults to using `timeframe.period`, which returns the chart's current timeframe. The script then converts the timeframe in seconds into various other units of time, including minutes, hours, and days, and displays the original string and converted numeric values in a [table](#tables):

```
//@version=5
indicator("Timeframe to value")

tfInSec  = timeframe.in_seconds()
tfInMin  = tfInSec / 60
tfInHrs  = tfInMin / 60
tfInDays = tfInHrs / 24

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var table displayTable = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 5, na, color.gray, 1, color.gray, 1)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 0, "Original TF string",   text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 0, "\"" + timeframe.period + "\"", text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 1, "Timeframe in seconds", text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 1, str.tostring(tfInSec),  text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 2, "Timeframe in minutes", text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 2, str.tostring(tfInMin),  text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 3, "Timeframe in hours",   text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 3, str.tostring(tfInHrs),  text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 4, "Timeframe in days",    text_color = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(displayTable, 1, 4, str.tostring(tfInDays), text_color = chart.fg_color)
```

## [How can I convert a timeframe in "float" minutes into a string usable with `request.security()`?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-convert-a-timeframe-in-float-minutes-into-a-string-usable-with-requestsecurity)

The built-in function [timeframe.from_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.from_seconds) function converts a number of seconds into a timeframe string that is compatible with [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security).

The example script below converts a user-defined number of minutes into a timeframe string using the [timeframe.from_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.from_seconds) function.
The script then requests the close price from that timeframe using [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) and plots it.
Additionally, we display the resulting timeframe string in a [table](#tables) on the chart's top right corner:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Target TF in string from float minutes", "", true)
float tfInMinInput = input.float(1440, "Minutes in target timeframe (<= 0.0167 [1 sec.])", minval = 0.0167)
// Convert target TF in minutes from input into string.
string targetTfString = timeframe.from_seconds(int(tfInMinInput * 60))
// Fetch target timeframe's close.
float targetTfClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, targetTfString, close)
// Plot target timeframe close.
plot(targetTfClose, "Target TF close")
// Display the target timeframe string in a table cell at the chart's top right.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var table displayTable = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1, color.new(color.yellow, 70), color.gray, 1, color.gray, 1)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 0, str.format("Target TF (string): {0}", targetTfString), text_color = chart.fg_color)
```

## [How do I define a higher timeframe that is a multiple of the chart timeframe?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-define-a-higher-timeframe-that-is-a-multiple-of-the-chart-timeframe)

This example script uses the [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds) and [timeframe.from_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.from_seconds) functions to calculate a higher timeframe that is a fixed multiple of the chart's current timeframe. Using the input for the multiplier, the user can define the ratio between the chart's
timeframe and the higher timeframe. The script then calculates the [Relative Strength Index](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502338-relative-strength-index-rsi/) (RSI) for both the chart's timeframe and the  higher timeframe, plotting both in a separate pane for comparison. We display the calculated higher timeframe string in a [table](#tables) on the main chart pane by using `force_overlay`:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Multiple of current TF", overlay = false)

// Provide an input to specify the multiple to apply to the chart's timeframe.
float tfMult = input.float(4, minval = 1)

// Get multiple of current timeframe.
string targetTfString = timeframe.from_seconds(int(timeframe.in_seconds() * tfMult))
// Create RSI from the current timeframe.
float myRsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)
plot(myRsi, "Current TF RSI", color = color.silver)
// Non-repainting HTF RSI.
float myRsiHtf = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, targetTfString, myRsi[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
plot(myRsiHtf, "Non-repainting HTF RSI", color = color.green)

// Display the calculated timeframe at the top right of the main chart pane. 
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var table displayTable = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1, color.new(color.yellow, 70), color.gray, 1, color.gray, 1, force_overlay = true)
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 0, str.format("Target TF (string): {0}", targetTfString), text_color = chart.fg_color)
```

## [How can I plot a moving average only when the chart's timeframe is 1D or higher?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-plot-a-moving-average-only-when-the-charts-timeframe-is-1d-or-higher)

To plot a moving average on a chart only if it has a timeframe of daily ("1D") or higher, scripts can use the [timeframe.in_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.in_seconds) function to convert the chart's current timeframe into seconds. Since a day consists of 86400 seconds, any timeframe equal to or exceeding this value corresponds to a daily or longer duration.

The example script below calculates and plots a [Simple Moving Average](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000696841-simple-moving-average/) (SMA) of the closing prices over the last 200 bars.
The script uses a [ternary operator](#-ternary-operator) to return the moving average on timeframes of 1D or greater, or [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) if the timeframe is shorter than one day. Because [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) calls cannot be in a local scope, scripts cannot conditionally call this function. Passing an [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value as the `series` argument is an effective way to not plot anything. Note that plotting an [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value *does* count towards the script's [plot limit](#plot-limits).

```
//@version=5
indicator("Timeframe-dependent MA", overlay = true)
bool tfIsDailyOrGreater = timeframe.in_seconds() >= 86400
float ma = ta.sma(close, 200)
plot(tfIsDailyOrGreater ? ma : na, "MA", color.aqua)
```

## [What happens if I plot a moving average from the 1H timeframe on a different timeframe?](https://www.tradingview.com#what-happens-if-i-plot-a-moving-average-from-the-1h-timeframe-on-a-different-timeframe)

The [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function can access data from a different *context*, such as a different symbol or timeframe. There are different considerations when accessing data from a timeframe *higher* or *lower* than the chart timeframe.

First, let's consider an example of plotting data from a *lower* timeframe. The following script plots a 21-period [Exponential Moving Average](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000592270-exponential-moving-average/) (EMA) derived from the 1-hour (1H) timeframe on any chart, irrespective of the timeframe of that chart:

```
//@version=5
indicator("1hr EMA", overlay = true)
plot(request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "60", ta.ema(close, 21)), color = color.orange)
```

Assuming that we run this script on a chart with a daily timeframe, we encounter the following problems:

- For each daily bar, the chart can plot only 1 of the 24 MA values theoretically available. The plot misses out the intraday fluctuations and trends that a 1H moving average (MA) is typically used to identify.
- The script above displays only the EMA value calculated for the *final* 1-hour bar of each day. In realtime, the plot displays the most recently known value.

Unlike [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security), the [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf) function is intended for use on lower timeframes. It returns an [array](#arrays) containing data from all available intrabars within a chart bar. See [this section](#requestsecurity_lower_tf) of the User Manual to learn more.

We could rewrite the script to use [request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf), but plotting a moving average from a lower timeframe is still not very practical.

A more logical approach is to plot MAs from a *higher* timeframe. This strategy shows broader market trends within the context of shorter-term price movements. For example, plotting a daily MA on a 1H chart provides insights into how intraday prices are trending relative to the longer-term daily average.

In the following example script, we plot the 21 EMA calculated at the 1H timeframe, but only when the chart's timeframe is *equal to or lower than* 1H. We call the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function [in the recommended way](#higher-timeframes) to avoid repainting.

```
//@version=5
indicator("HTF EMA", overlay = true)

// Input to specify the timeframe for `request.security() call.
string tfinput      = input.timeframe("60", "Timeframe for MA")

// @function            A wrapper for the `request.security()` function for non-repainting calls to HTFs.
// @param timeframe     Timeframe of the requested data. 
//                      To use the chart's timeframe, use an empty string or the `timeframe.period` variable.
// @param expression    An expression to calculate and returne from the request.security() call's context.
// @returns             The result of the calculated expression.
htfSecurity(string timeframe, expression) =>
    result = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, expression[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

// Calculate the moving average in the chart context.
float ma = ta.ema(close, 21)
// Calculate the moving average in the specified `tfInput` timeframe.
float htfMA = htfSecurity(tfinput, ma)

// Check whether the requested timeframe is greater or less than the chart's timeframe.
bool tfIsGreater = timeframe.in_seconds() < timeframe.in_seconds(tfinput)
bool tfIsLess    = timeframe.in_seconds() > timeframe.in_seconds(tfinput)

// Plot the HTF MA, the chart MA, or nothing, depending on the timeframe.
float maPlot = tfIsGreater ? htfMA : tfIsLess ? na : ma
plot(maPlot, "Requested MA", color.orange)

// Display a message in a table indicating that the requested timeframe is lower than the chart's timeframe, if applicable.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory and tfIsLess
    var table displayTable = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.new(color.yellow, 70))
    table.cell(displayTable, 0, 0, "Requested TF is lower than chart's TF\nNo MA displayed", text_color = color.red)
```

## [Why do intraday price and volume values differ from values retrieved with `request.security()` at daily timeframes and higher?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-do-intraday-price-and-volume-values-differ-from-values-retrieved-with-requestsecurity-at-daily-timeframes-and-higher)

Intraday [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low), [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close), and [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) (OHLCV) values can be different from those from [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) at daily timeframes and higher for a number of reasons, including the following:

- **Different data feeds:** Certain trades (like block trades and OTC trades, especially in stocks) are recorded only at the end of the trading day, so their volume affects the End-of-Day (EOD) feed but not the intraday feed.
- **Price discrepancies:** There can be slight differences in prices between EOD and intraday data. For example, an EOD high might not match any intraday highs due to variations in data feeds.
- **Extended hours data:** EOD data feeds do not include information from trading outside regular hours, unlike some intraday feeds. For instance, the bars of an hourly chart might straddle the open of a session, mixing data from pre-market and regular trading.

For an extended list of factors with detailed explanations, refer to the [Data feeds](#data-feeds) section in the User Manual.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[FAQ](#faq)/Programming

# [Programming](https://www.tradingview.com#programming)

## [What does "scope" mean?](https://www.tradingview.com#what-does-scope-mean)

The *scope* of a variable is the part of a script that defines the variable and in which it can be referenced. There are two main types of scope: *global* and *local*.

**Global Scope:** The global scope is all of the script that is not inside a [function](#user-defined-functions), [if statement](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if), or other [conditional structure](#conditional-structures). Code from anywhere in the script can access global variables. There is only one global scope.

**Local Scope:** Code that is inside a function or in any local block (one that is inset by four spaces) defines a local scope. Only code that is in the same local scope can access a local variable. There can be many local scopes.

The following example script gives an "Undeclared identifier" error when we try to access a local variable from the global scope.

```
//@version=5
indicator("Scope demo")

// Global scope
int globalValue = close > open ? 1 : -1

if barstate.isconfirmed
    // Local scope
    int localValue = close > open ? 1 : -1

plot(localValue, "Local variable", chart.fg_color, 2)
```

To fix this error, we can declare the variable in the global scope, thus making it accessible from any scope in the script, and then conditionally modify it within a local block:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Scope demo")

// Global scope
int globalValue = close > open ? 1 : -1
int localValue  = na

if barstate.isconfirmed
    // Local scope
    localValue := close > open ? 1 : -1

plot(localValue, "Local variable", chart.fg_color, 2)
```

Similarly, the following script gives an "Undeclared identifier" error when we try to access a variable defined in one local scope from another local scope. In this case, local scope 1 *contains* local scope 2, but the same problem would be present if they were on the same level. When a scope contains another one, the inner scope can access variables declared in the outer one, but not vice versa.

```
//@version=5
indicator("Scope demo")

bool isUpCandleWithLargerUpWick = false

if barstate.isconfirmed
    // Local scope 1
    bool upWickIsLarger = (high - math.max(open, close)) > (math.min(open,close) - low)
    if close > open
        // Local scope 2
        bool isUpCandle = true
    isUpCandleWithLargerUpWick := upWickIsLarger and isUpCandle ? true : false

plot(isUpCandleWithLargerUpWick, "Global variable depending on two local variables", chart.fg_color, 2)
```

For more information about scopes, see the [Code](#code) section of the User Manual.

## [How can I convert a script to a newer version of Pine Script™?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-convert-a-script-to-a-newer-version-of-pine-script)

See the [Migration Guides](#overview) section of the User Manual for instructions about upgrading the version of Pine that a script uses.

## [Can I access the source code of "Invite-Only" or "closed-source" scripts?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-access-the-source-code-of-invite-only-or-closed-source-scripts)

No; only *open* scripts have their source code visible. The source code of *protected* and *Invite-Only* scripts is hidden and can only be seen by the script author.

For a definition of the *access types* of published scripts: open, protected, and Invite-Only, see [this article](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000482573-what-are-the-different-types-of-published-scripts/) in the Help Center.

For an explanation on the *visibility* (public/private) that a script can have, see the [Visibility](#visibility) section of the Publishing scripts page in the User Manual.

## [Is Pine Script™ an object-oriented language?](https://www.tradingview.com#is-pine-script-an-object-oriented-language)

Although Pine Script™ is not strictly an object-oriented programming language, it incorporates some object-oriented features, notably [user-defined types](#user-defined-types) (UDTs).
Scripts can create [objects](#objects) as instances of a UDT. These objects have one or more fields, which can store values of various data types.

Here is a simple example of how to use the [type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_type) keyword to create an object:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Object demo")

// Define a new type named `pivot`.
type pivot
    int   x
    float y
    bool  isHigh

// Create a new `pivot` with specific values.
pivot newPivot = pivot.new(bar_index, close, true)

// Plot the `y` component of `newPivot`.
plot(newPivot.y)
```

In this example, we create an object `newPivot`, which is an instance of the user-defined type `pivot`. The script then plots the `y` field of `newPivot`.

## [How can I access the source code of built-in indicators?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-access-the-source-code-of-built-in-indicators)

There are two ways to access the source code of built-in indicators that are written in Pine:

**Create a new indicator**

In the Pine Script™ Editor, click the dropdown menu (the arrow in the upper-left corner of the editor pane) and choose the "*Create new*" > "*Built in…*" option. Select the built-in indicator that you want to work with.

**Edit the code**

With the indicator displayed on the chart, click on the curly braces `{}` next to the indicator name to open it in the Pine Editor.
To edit the code, click the option to create a working copy.

Some built-in indicators, such as the Volume Profile or chart pattern indicators, are not written in Pine and so the code for these indicators is not accessible.
These indicators are not included in the "*Built-in script*" menu, and curly braces are not displayed next to their names on the chart.

## [How can I examine the value of a string in my script?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-examine-the-value-of-a-string-in-my-script)

Scripts can print strings to Pine Logs on any or every bar, along with messages about the logic of the script at that point.
See the [Pine Logs](#pine-logs) section of the User Manual for information about logging.

Scripts can also display string in labels or label tooltips. The following example scripts displays a string in a label on the last bar of the chart using a custom function.

```
//@version=5
indicator("print()", "", true)

print(string txt) =>
    // Create a persistent label
    var label myLabel = label.new(bar_index, na, txt, xloc.bar_index, yloc.price, color(na), label.style_label_left, chart.fg_color, size.large, text.align_left)
    // Update the label's x and y position, and the text it displays.
    label.set_xy(myLabel, bar_index, open)
    label.set_text(myLabel, txt)

if barstate.islast
    print("Timeframe = " + timeframe.period)
```

For more techniques, see the [debugging strings](#strings) section of the User Manual.

## [How can I visualize my script's conditions?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-visualize-my-scripts-conditions)

If a script contains complex logical conditions, it can be difficult to debug the output. Visualizing each condition separately can help to debug any problems.
See the [Compound and nested conditions](#compound-and-nested-conditions) section of the User Manual for an example.

## [How can I make the console appear in the editor?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-make-the-console-appear-in-the-editor)

To display the console in the editor, either press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + ` (grave accent), or right-click within the editor and choose the "Toggle Console" option.

## [How can I plot numeric values so that they don't affect the indicator's scale?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-plot-numeric-values-so-that-they-dont-affect-the-indicators-scale)

Plotting numerical values on the main chart pane can distort the price scale if the values differ too much from the price.

One way around this is not to plot the values on the chart, but use the Data Window to inspect them. Add `display = display.data_window` to the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) call, and the values are visible in the Data Window for any single historical or realtime bar that the cursor hovers over.

Another option is to set the script to display in a separate pane by using `overlay = false` in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration. The user needs to delete and re-add the script to the chart if this parameter is changed. Plot the numeric values to track in the separate pane, and draw the rest of the script visuals on the main chart pane by using the `force_overlay` parameter.

Additionally, right-clicking on the scale on the chart brings out the dropdown menu. The "Scale Price Chart Only" option there makes it so the Auto mode of the chart scale only takes the chart itself into account, without adjusting for plots or other graphics of all indicators that overlay that chart.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[FAQ](#faq)/Strategies

# [Strategies](https://www.tradingview.com#strategies)

Using Pine Script™ strategy scripts, users can test *simulated* trades on historical and realtime data, to backtest and forward test trading systems. Strategies are similar to indicators, but with added capabilities such as placing, modifying, and canceling simulated orders and analyzing their results. Scripts that use the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function as their [declaration statement](#declaration-statement) gain access to the `strategy.*` namespace, which contains functions and variables for simulating orders and retrieving strategy information.

When a user applies a strategy that uses [order placement commands](#order-placement-and-cancellation) to the chart, the strategy uses the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) to calculate simulated trades, and displays the results in the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) tab.

Strategies support [various types of orders](#order-types) including market, limit, stop, and stop-limit orders, allowing programmers to simulate different trading scenarios. Strategy order commands can send alerts when [order fill events](#order-fill-events) occur. An *order fill event* is triggered by the broker emulator when it executes a simulated order in realtime.

For a thorough exploration of strategy features, capabilities, and usage, refer to the [Strategies](#strategies) section in the User Manual.

## [Strategy basics](https://www.tradingview.com#strategy-basics)

### [How can I turn my indicator into a strategy?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-turn-my-indicator-into-a-strategy)

To convert an indicator to a strategy, begin by replacing the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration with the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration. This designates the script as a strategy.

Add strategy [order functions](#order-placement-and-cancellation) for executing orders. Use logical conditions from the indicator to call the strategy order functions.

The following example includes two scripts: an initial indicator script and a strategy script converted from the indicator. We use a simple RSI oscillator as a momentum indicator to gauge the direction of a market's momentum, with values above 50 indicating an upward (bullish) trend and values below 50 signaling a downward (bearish) trend:

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-basics-How-can-i-turn-my-indicator-into-a-strategy-1.gVd2FK1g_2s7IB7.png)

The initial indicator colors the plot line and the bars on the chart in a lime color when the RSI is greater than 50 and fuchsia when less than 50. We use [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) to plot triangles at the top and bottom of the oscillator on bars where the RSI crosses over or under the 50 level.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Example RSI indicator")
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)
plot(rsi, "RSI", rsi >= 50 ? color.lime : color.fuchsia)
hline(50, "Middle line", linestyle = hline.style_solid)
plotshape(ta.crossover(rsi,  50), "Cross up",   shape.arrowup,   location.bottom, color.lime)
plotshape(ta.crossunder(rsi, 50), "Cross Down", shape.arrowdown, location.top,    color.fuchsia)
barcolor(rsi >= 50 ? color.lime : color.fuchsia)
```

In the converted strategy version, we maintain the same RSI crossover and crossunder conditions used in the indicator script. These conditions, which previously only drew the [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) triangles, now also trigger entry orders for long and short positions using the [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) function. A long entry is called when the RSI crosses over 50, and a short entry is initiated when it crosses under 50. A long entry cancels a short trade, and vice-versa.

```
//@version=6
strategy("Example RSI strategy")
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)
plot(rsi, "RSI", rsi >= 50 ? color.lime : color.fuchsia)
hline(50, "Middle line", linestyle = hline.style_solid)
plotshape(ta.crossover(rsi,  50), "Cross up",   shape.triangleup,   location.bottom, color.lime)
plotshape(ta.crossunder(rsi, 50), "Cross Down", shape.triangledown, location.top,    color.fuchsia)
barcolor(rsi >= 50 ? color.lime : color.fuchsia)

if ta.crossover(rsi,  50)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, comment = "Long")

if ta.crossunder(rsi,  50)
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short, comment = "Short")
```

### [How do I set a basic stop-loss order?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-set-a-basic-stop-loss-order)

Stop losses are a risk management method that traders use to limit potential losses. The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function sets an order to exit a trade once it hits a specified price, thus preventing the loss from exceeding a predetermined amount.

To implement a basic stop loss in Pine Script, use the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function with either the `stop` or the `loss` parameter. The `stop` parameter specifies the *price* for the stop loss order, while the `loss` parameter sets the stop loss a certain number of *ticks* away from the entry order's price. Similarly, to set a take-profit level, use either the `limit` parameter, specifying the exact price for taking profit, or the `profit` parameter, defining the profit
size in ticks from the entry price.

If a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call includes both the `stop`*and*`loss` parameters, or both the `limit`*and*`profit` parameters, the function uses the price level that is expected to trigger an exit first.

The following example script uses the tick-based `loss` parameter for long positions and the price-based `stop` parameter for short positions, and plots these stop levels on the chart.
The script enters positions on the crossover or crossunder of two simple moving averages.

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-basics-How-do-i-set-a-stop-loss-1.BKHhl7z6_A7KbA.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Stop using `loss` and `stop`", overlay = true)

int lossTicksInput = input.int(60, "Stop loss in ticks (for longs)")
float atrMultInput = input.float(1.0, "ATR multiplier (for shorts)", minval = 0)

// Calculate the ATR value, adjusted by the multiplier, for setting dynamic stop loss levels on short positions.
float atr = ta.atr(14) * atrMultInput

// A persistent short stop loss level, updated based on short entry signals.
var float shortStopLevel = na

// Define conditions for entering long and short positions based on the crossover and crossunder of two SMAs.
float ma1 = ta.sma(close,  14)
float ma2 = ta.sma(close,  28)
bool longCondition  = ta.crossover(ma1,  ma2)
bool shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ma1, ma2)

// On detecting a long condition, place a long entry.
if longCondition
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
// For a short condition, place a short entry and set the stop loss level by adding the ATR value to the closing price.
if shortCondition
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)
    shortStopLevel := close + atr

// Apply a fixed-size stop loss for long positions using the specified input tick size in the `loss` parameter.
strategy.exit(id = "Long Exit",  from_entry = "Long",  loss = lossTicksInput)
// For short positions, set the stop loss at the calculated price level using the `stop` parameter.
strategy.exit(id = "Short Exit", from_entry = "Short", stop = shortStopLevel)

// Calculate the long stop loss price by subtracting the loss size from the average entry price.
// Set the price to `na` if the strategy is not in a long position.
float longStopPlot  = strategy.position_size > 0 ? strategy.position_avg_price - lossTicksInput * syminfo.mintick : na
// The short stop price is already calculated. Set to `na` if the strategy is not in a short position.
float shortStopPlot = strategy.position_size < 0 ? shortStopLevel : na
// Plot the moving averages and stop loss levels.
plot(ma1, "MA 1", color.new(color.lime,    50))
plot(ma2, "MA 2", color.new(color.fuchsia, 50))
plot(longStopPlot,  "Long Stop",  color.red, style = plot.style_steplinebr)
plot(shortStopPlot, "Short Stop", color.red, style = plot.style_steplinebr)
// Color the background when long or short conditions are met.
bgcolor(longCondition ? color.new(color.aqua, 80) : shortCondition ? color.new(color.orange, 90) : na)
```

For more information, see the entry in the User Manual on [strategy.exit()](#strategyexit).

### [How do I set an advanced stop-loss order?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-set-an-advanced-stop-loss-order)

Scripts can use different types of exits that are more advanced than simply closing the position at a predetermined level.

**Bracket orders**

A bracket order is a pair of orders that close the position if price moves far enough in either direction. Scripts can combine a stop-loss and take-profit order within a single [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function call. See the FAQ entry about [bracket orders](#how-can-i-configure-a-bracket-order-with-a-specific-risk-to-reward-rr-ratio) for more details.

**Trailing stop losses**

A trailing stop loss is a stop loss that moves with price, but in the profitable direction only. To create a trailing stop, either adjust the stop price with each new bar, or use the built-in trailing stop parameters in the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function. Refer to the FAQ on implementing a
[trailing stop loss](#how-do-i-place-a-trailing-stop-loss) for information and examples.

**Scaled exits**

Scaled exits use multiple exit orders at varied price levels. When using tiered exit strategies, which progressively scale out of a position, ensure that the total quantity of all exit orders does not surpass the size of the initial entry position. Consult the FAQ on [multiple exits](#how-can-i-use-multiple-take-profit-levels-to-close-a-position) for more information.

**Moving a stop loss to breakeven**

Adjusting a stop loss to the breakeven point once a specific condition is met can help in risk management. Details can be found in the FAQ on [moving stop losses to breakeven](#how-do-i-move-my-stop-loss-order-to-breakeven).

**Adjusting position size based on stop loss**

Modify the position size relative to the stop loss to maintain a constant risk percentage of total equity. For more insights, see the FAQ on [position sizing](#how-can-i-risk-a-fixed-percentage-of-my-equity-per-trade).

### [How can I save the entry price in a strategy?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-save-the-entry-price-in-a-strategy)

Scripts can access the entry price for a *specific trade*, or the average entry price for a *position*.

**Average entry price**

The [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price) variable automatically updates to the average entry price of the current position. If the position consist of only one trade, the average price of the position is equal to the entry price of that single trade.
If a strategy closes a market position that consists of multiple trades, trades are closed in the order they were opened, by default. Since the average price of the open position changes according to which positions are still open, be aware of the order in which trades are closed, and if necessary, configure it using the `close_entries_rule` parameter of the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration function.

**Specific entry price**

The [strategy.opentrades.entry_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.opentrades.entry_price) function returns the entry price for a given trade ID. To find the entry price for the most recent open trade, and remembering that the trade indexes start at zero, use `float entryPrice = strategy.opentrades.entry_price(strategy.opentrades - 1)`.

### [How do I filter trades by a date or time range?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-filter-trades-by-a-date-or-time-range)

Using a date and time range filter in a strategy allows trades to be simulated only during a certain time period. Such filters can be useful to backtest specific historical periods, or to focus on particular times of the trading day.

Additionally, if the strategy sends signals for live trading, consider excluding all trades earlier than the trading start date and time, to ensure that the broker emulator starts in a neutral state.

The following example script restricts trading if a bar falls within a defined `startTime` and `endTime`, or outside of an optional intraday session window. The script colors the background red for bars that fall outside the time windows. On the screenshot, we've limited the trading range from June 1st 2024 to June 10th 2024, and additionally forbidden trading from 0000-0300 UTC:

![image](images/Strategies-Strategy-basics-How-do-i-implement-date-time-range-filtering-in-strategies-1.D00x6Oy9_Z1drnkX.png)

bool   useTimeFilterInput = input.bool(false, "Restrict trades during the following times (" + TZ + ")") 
string sessionStringInput = input.session("0000-0300", "")          

// @function                Determines whether the current bar falls within a specified date and time range.
// @param startTime         (int) A timestamp marking the start of the time window.
// @param endTime           (int) A timestamp marking the end of the time window.
// @param useDateFilter     (bool) Whether to filter between `startTime` and `endTime`. Optional.
// @param useTimeFilter     (bool) Whether to restrict trades in the time session. Optional.

// @returns                 (bool) `true` if the current bar is within the specified date and time range.
timeWithinAllowedRange(
     int    startTime, int endTime,
     bool   useDateFilter = true,
     bool   useTimeFilter = false,
     string timeSession   = "0000-0000",

**Note that:**

- We use the [time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) function to calculate whether bars are outside the user-defined session times. For additional details on integrating session data in Pine Script™, refer to the [Sessions](#sessions) section in the User Manual.
- We set the `confirm` argument to `true` for the inputs that define the time range. When the script is first added to the chart, it prompts the user to confirm the values by clicking on the chart.

## [Order execution and management](https://www.tradingview.com#order-execution-and-management)

### [Why are my orders executed on the bar following my triggers?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-are-my-orders-executed-on-the-bar-following-my-triggers)

Each historical bar in a chart is composed of a single set of [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) (OHLC) data. Pine scripts execute on this data once per historical bar, at the **close** of the bar.

So that results are consistent between historical and realtime bars, strategies also execute at the close of realtime bars. The next possible moment for an order to be filled is the beginning of the next bar.

Users can [alter a strategy's calculation behavior](#altering-calculation-behavior) by configuring strategies to process orders at the close of the signal bar instead, by selecting the "Fill orders/On bar close" setting in the "Settings/Properties" tab. Programmers can do the same by setting the [process_orders_on_close](#process_orders_on_close) parameter to `true` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement:

```
//@version=6
strategy("My Strategy", process_orders_on_close = true, ...)
```

An alternative method is to specify the `immediately` parameter as `true` in a [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) or [strategy.close_all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all) function call. This setting causes the broker emulator to close a position on the same tick that the strategy creates the close order — meaning, when bar closes instead of the beginning of the next one. The [process_orders_on_close](#process_orders_on_close) parameter affects all closing orders in the strategy, whereas the `immediately` parameter affects only the close order in which it is used.

However, processing orders on close might not give accurate results. For instance, if an alert occurs at the close of the session's last bar, the actual order can be executed only on the next trading day, since the bar is already closed. In contrast, the emulator would simulate the order being filled at the previous day's close. This discrepancy can lead to repainting, where the behavior of the strategy's simulation on historical bars differs from that seen in live trading.

### [How can I use multiple take-profit levels to close a position?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-use-multiple-take-profit-levels-to-close-a-position)

Setting up a strategy with multiple take profit levels enables traders to scale out of trades in segments to secure profits incrementally.

There are two main methods for scaling out at varying levels:

- Multiple [strategy.exit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) calls. This method is most suitable when each take-profit level has a corresponding stop loss.
- An [OCA reduce group](#strategyocareduce). This method is ideal for a different number of take-profit levels and stop losses.

#### [Multiple `strategy.exit()` functions](https://www.tradingview.com#multiple-strategyexit-functions)

Each [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call can set a bracket order for a specific take-profit and stop-loss level.
However, if a strategy uses multiple [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) functions with the **same** stop level, each function call triggers a *separate* order (and therefore multiple order alerts). If order alerts are configured to trigger real trades, ensure that the trade system handles multiple alerts at the same stop level appropriately.

The following example script uses two separate [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) functions, each with its own stop-loss and take-profit levels. The quantity for the first bracket order is set to 50% of the total position size. This combination of orders creates a scaled exit with distinct stop levels.

![image](images/Strategies-Order-execution-and-management-How-can-i-set-up-multiple-take-profit-levels-to-gradually-close-out-a-position-1.B0Hj7Z0J_Z25ph33.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Multiple exit demo", overlay = true)

int exitPercentInput = input.int(1, "Exit %", minval = 1, maxval = 99)
float exitPercent = exitPercentInput / 100

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0

var float stopLoss1 = na, var float takeProfit1 = na  // Exit levels for `Exit1`
var float stopLoss2 = na, var float takeProfit2 = na  // Exit levels for `Exit2`

// Place orders when `buyCondition` is true and we are not in a position.
if buyCondition and strategy.position_size == 0.0
    stopLoss1 := close * (1 - exitPercent), takeProfit1 := close * (1 + exitPercent)  // Update the levels based on the current price
    stopLoss2 := close * (1 - (2 * exitPercent)), takeProfit2 := close * (1 + (2 * exitPercent))
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, qty = 2)
    strategy.exit("Exit1", "Buy", stop = stopLoss1, limit = takeProfit1, qty_percent = 50)
    strategy.exit("Exit2", "Buy", stop = stopLoss2, limit = takeProfit2)

// Set `stopLoss1` and `takeProfit1` to `na` when price touches either.
if low <= stopLoss1 or high >= takeProfit1
    stopLoss1   := na
    takeProfit1 := na
// Set `stopLoss2` and `takeProfit2` to `na` when price touches either.
if low <= stopLoss2 or high >= takeProfit2
    stopLoss2   := na
    takeProfit2 := na

plot(stopLoss1,   "SL1", color.red,   style = plot.style_circles)
plot(stopLoss2,   "SL2", color.red,   style = plot.style_circles)
plot(takeProfit1, "TP1", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(takeProfit2, "TP2", color.green, style = plot.style_circles)
```

**Note that:**

- We use persistent global variables for the take-profit and stop-loss levels so that we can plot them. Otherwise, declaring the variables in the first [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) block would be simpler.

#### [Using `strategy.oca.reduce`](https://www.tradingview.com#using-strategyocareduce)

Creating exit orders as a group, using the [strategy.oca.reduce](#strategyocareduce) type, ensures that when one exit order from the group is filled, the quantity of the remaining orders is reduced accordingly. This method is ideal in scripts that have an unequal number of take-profit levels to stops.

The following example script uses two take-profit levels but only one stop level. All three sell orders have the same `oca_name`, which means they form a group. They have `oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce` set, so that filling one of the limit orders reduces the quantity of the remaining orders. The total quantity of the exit orders matches the entry order quantity, preventing the strategy from trading an excessive number of units and causing a reversal.

bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0  // Is `true` on every 100th bar.

// Place orders when `buyCondition` is true and we are not in a position.
if buyCondition and strategy.position_size == 0
    stop   := close * (1 - exitPercent)
    limit1 := close * (1 + exitPercent)
    limit2 := close * (1 + (2 * exitPercent))
    strategy.entry("Long",    strategy.long, 6)
    // All three sell orders use the "Bracket" OCA group; filling one order reduces the quantity of the remaining orders.
    strategy.order("Stop",    strategy.short, stop  = stop,   qty = 6, oca_name = "Bracket", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce)
    strategy.order("Limit 1", strategy.short, limit = limit1, qty = 3, oca_name = "Bracket", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce)
    strategy.order("Limit 2", strategy.short, limit = limit2, qty = 6, oca_name = "Bracket", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce)

// Set `limit1` to `na` when price exceeds it.
if high >= limit1
    limit1 := na
// Set `stop`, `limit11`, and `limit2` to `na` when price surpasses either the last take-profit, or the stop.
if low <= stop or high >= limit2
    stop := na, limit1 := na, limit2 := na

### [How can I execute a trade partway through a bar?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-execute-a-trade-partway-through-a-bar)

On [historical bars](#calculation-based-on-historical-bars), Pine scripts can access only a single set of [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) (OHLC) data per bar.
Consequently, strategies are calculated once, at the close of each bar. This limitation means it's not possible to evaluate logical conditions that occur mid-bar, such as a price cross, on historical data.

#### [Using `calc_on_every_tick`](https://www.tradingview.com#using-calc_on_every_tick)

Strategies running on [realtime bars](#calculation-based-on-realtime-bars) can execute orders partway through a bar by enabling the [calc_on_every_tick](#calc_on_every_tick) parameter. This setting allows the strategy to process each tick (incoming price update) and execute trades on the tick after a logical condition occurs.

#### [Using predefined prices](https://www.tradingview.com#using-predefined-prices)

Stop or limit orders at predefined prices *can* execute orders partway through a bar, even when the strategy does not enable the `calc_on_every_tick` parameter. This method is effective on both realtime *and* historical data. Even though orders are processed on the close of historical bars, the broker emulator simulates an order fill at the predefined price level, if the broker determines that price has hit that level during the bar.
For information about the assumptions that the broker emulator makes about price movements, see the [Broker emulator](#broker-emulator) section of the User Manual.

The following example script uses stop and limit orders to exit a trade partway through a bar. The script calls the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function with the `stop` and `limit` parameters, determining the specific price levels at which the trade will exit.

![image](images/Strategies-Order-execution-and-management-How-can-i-execute-a-trade-midway-through-a-bar-before-it-fully-closes-1.D1Kusv4G_7Dxa1.png)

//@version=6
strategy("Predefined price exit demo", overlay = true)

int exitPercentInput = input.int(1, "Exit %", minval = 1, maxval = 99)
float exitPercent = exitPercentInput / 100

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0

var float stopLoss   = na
var float takeProfit = na

// Place orders when `buyCondition` is true and we are not in a position.

    stopLoss   := close * (1 - exitPercent)
    takeProfit := close * (1 + exitPercent)
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
    strategy.exit("exit", "buy", stop = stopLoss, limit = takeProfit)

// Set `stopLoss` and `takeProfit` to `na` when price touches either, i.e., when the strategy simulates an exit.
if low <= stopLoss or high >= takeProfit
    stopLoss   := na

### [How can I exit a trade in the same bar as it opens?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-exit-a-trade-in-the-same-bar-as-it-opens)

Sometimes, strategy testers want to be able to exit a trade in the same bar as the entry. By default, if an exit condition occurs during the same bar that a trade is opened, the broker emulator closes the trade at the open of the *next* bar. To learn why this happens, refer to [this FAQ entry](#why-are-my-orders-executed-on-the-bar-following-my-triggers).

To override this default behavior, either specify exit prices, or exit with a market order at the bar close.

#### [Specifying exit prices](https://www.tradingview.com#specifying-exit-prices)

If the entry command also sets stop-loss or take-profit orders to trigger an exit when certain price levels are reached, then the trade can exit during the same bar that it opens.

In the following example script, the trade exits within the same bar *if* the price hits either of the defined profit or loss levels. Setting small profit and loss values increases the likelihood of triggering an exit within the entry bar, although the trade could hit those levels for the first time in a subsequent bar instead.

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exit on entry bar with specific price", overlay = true)

int exitTickSizeInput = input.int(10, "Exit if price moves this many ticks", minval = 1)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 10 == 0

// Place orders when `buyCondition` is true and we are not in a position.
if buyCondition and strategy.position_size == 0.0
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
    strategy.exit("exit", "buy", profit = exitTickSizeInput, loss = exitTickSizeInput)
```

#### [Using a market order at bar close](https://www.tradingview.com#using-a-market-order-at-bar-close)

Another method to exit a trade in the same bar that it opens is to use a market order at the bar's close, by setting the `immediately` argument to `true` in the [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) function.

In the following example script, if the buy order is opened, the strategy closes the position at the end of the entry bar. Scripts can call the [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) function conditionally within a local block if necessary. For simplicity, in this example we apply the command to every entry.

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exit on entry bar with market order", overlay = true)

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 10 == 0

// Place orders when `buyCondition` is true and we are not in a position.
if buyCondition and strategy.position_size == 0.0
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)

strategy.close("buy", immediately = true)
```

## [Advanced order types and conditions](https://www.tradingview.com#advanced-order-types-and-conditions)

### [How can I set stop-loss and take-profit levels as a percentage from my entry point?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-set-stop-loss-and-take-profit-levels-as-a-percentage-from-my-entry-point)

To set exit orders as a percentage from the entry price, the script needs the average entry price calculated by the broker emulator (which is affected by conditions including multiple entries and slippage). However, the built-in variable [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price) returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) until the close of the entry bar. This means that take-profit and stop-loss orders based on the entry price can only be placed during the *next* bar.

If programmers want strategies to be able to close trades on the same bar that they are opened, there are two workarounds, each of which have their own benefits and limitations: altering the emulator behavior and using a different, fixed value.

#### [Using `calc_on_order_fills`](https://www.tradingview.com#using-calc_on_order_fills)

Setting the [calc_on_order_fills](#calc_on_order_fills) argument of the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration function to `true` recalculates the strategy immediately after simulating an order fill. This setting provides access to data such as the current average price of a position on an unconfirmed bar.

The following example script sets take-profit and stop-loss orders during the entry bar, based on the entry price [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price). The script uses the `calc_on_order_fills` setting to enable this behavior.

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exit demo using `calc_on_order_fills`", overlay = true, calc_on_order_fills = true)

float stopSizeInput   = input.float(1.0, "SL %", minval = 0.0) / 100.0
float profitSizeInput = input.float(1.0, "TP %", minval = 0.0) / 100.0

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0

//@variable Stop-loss price for exit commands.
var float stopLoss   = na
//@variable Take-profit price for exit commands.
var float takeProfit = na

// Place orders when `buyCondition` is true and we are not in a position.
if buyCondition and strategy.position_size == 0.0
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)

// If we are in a position, set the exit orders.
if strategy.position_size != 0.0
    stopLoss   := strategy.position_avg_price * (1.0 - stopSizeInput)
    takeProfit := strategy.position_avg_price * (1.0 + profitSizeInput)
    strategy.exit("exit", "buy", stop = stopLoss, limit = takeProfit)

// Set `stopLoss` and `takeProfit` to `na` when price touches either, i.e., when the strategy simulates an exit.
if low <= stopLoss or high >= takeProfit
    stopLoss   := na
    takeProfit := na

plot(stopLoss,   "SL", color.red,   style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(takeProfit, "TP", color.green, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

**Note that:**

- If we change `calc_on_order_fills` to `false` in this script, the exit orders are placed on the bar *after* the entry bar, and can fill at very different levels depending on the movement of price.

#### [Using predefined prices](https://www.tradingview.com#using-predefined-prices-1)

The following example script calculates the stop and limit orders based on the *closing price* of the signal bar. The disadvantage of this approach is that the close price might not match the average opening price exactly. The advantage is that this method doesn't introduce potential *lookahead bias* like using `calc_on_order_fills`.

```
//@version=6
strategy("Exit demo using predefined prices", overlay = true)

float stopSizeInput   = input.float(1.0, "SL %", minval = 0.0) / 100.0
float profitSizeInput = input.float(1.0, "TP %", minval = 0.0) / 100.0

//@variable Is `true` on every 100th bar.
bool buyCondition = bar_index % 100 == 0

//@variable Stop-loss price for exit commands.
var float stopLoss   = na
//@variable Take-profit price for exit commands.
var float takeProfit = na

// Place orders when `buyCondition` is true and we are not in a position.
if buyCondition and strategy.position_size == 0.0
    stopLoss   := close * (1.0 - stopSizeInput)
    takeProfit := close * (1.0 + profitSizeInput)
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long)
    strategy.exit("exit", "buy", stop = stopLoss, limit = takeProfit)

// Set `stopLoss` and `takeProfit` to `na` when price touches either, i.e., when the strategy simulates an exit.
if low <= stopLoss or high >= takeProfit
    stopLoss   := na
    takeProfit := na

plot(stopLoss,   "SL", color.red,   style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(takeProfit, "TP", color.green, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

### [How do I move my stop-loss order to breakeven?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-move-my-stop-loss-order-to-breakeven)

Moving a stop-loss order to breakeven can be a useful technique to manage risk.

The following example script sets a persistent `stopLoss` variable when the strategy enters a position. The script then updates the stop price to the entry price when the market price gets halfway to the take-profit level. The script calls the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function on every bar to ensure that the broker emulator receives any updates made to the `stopLoss` value. Lastly, it plots the average price according to the [strategy.position_avg_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.position_avg_price) variable for reference.

### [How do I place a trailing stop loss?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-place-a-trailing-stop-loss)

A trailing stop loss limits a trader's losses while allowing a position to remain open as long as the price moves favorably.

Strategies can create trailing stops either by using the built-in functionality of the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function or by creating custom trailing stop-loss logic.

Trailing stops set in the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) use live price updates in realtime but [assumed price movements](#broker-emulator) for historical bars. These assumptions can cause [repainting](#repainting). This type of trailing stop is therefore potentially more responsive but less accurate.

Custom trailing stop values are typically updated at the close of each bar, and so do not capture realtime intrabar price movements with the same responsiveness. This delay helps to avoid repainting strategy results.

#### [Using built-in trailing stop functionality](https://www.tradingview.com#using-built-in-trailing-stop-functionality)

To set a trailing stop in the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function, specify both *when* the trail should activate and *how far* behind price it should trail.

**Activation level**

When price crosses this level, the trailing stop activates. The activation level can be set as a number of ticks past the entry price via the `trail_points` parameter, or as a price value via the `trail_price` parameter.

**Trail offset**

After it activates, the stop loss trails behind the bar's [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) or [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) price by this distance, defined in ticks using the `trail_offset` parameter.

In the following long-only example script, the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function uses the `trail_points` and `trail_offset` parameters to set a trailing stop. The
stop-loss trails the [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), minus the offset points, after it activates. The script creates and plots a separate `trailingStop` variable to visualize the trailing stop price that the function calculates internally, although this is not necessary for the trailing stop to function. We also set a separate stop-loss order to close trades that go too low before they trigger the trailing stop.

#### [Coding a custom trailing stop](https://www.tradingview.com#coding-a-custom-trailing-stop)

A custom trailing stop can use different activation conditions, and can trail in a different way, to the trailing stop built into the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function. To work correctly, a custom trailing stop must calculate the stop price on each bar that the stop is active, and call the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function on each bar to set the `stop` price.

The following example script triggers long and short trades based on crosses of two moving averages. A custom function calculates the trailing stop using the highest or lowest price from the last five bars, adjusted by an [Average True Range (ATR)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000501823-average-true-range-atr/) buffer. This method of distancing the stop by a measure of average price movement attempts to reduce premature stop triggers in volatile conditions.

//                          of bars using the ATR, for a stop distance proportional to average bar size.
// @param calcStop          (series bool) A condition that activates the trailing stop, e.g., being in a trade.
// @param length            (simple int) The number of bars to look back to determine the highest or lowest point for

// @param isLong            (simple bool) Indicator of the trailing stop's orientation: true for long trades

```

**Note that:**

- Because strategies run once per bar, the trailing stop price in this example script updates at the close of each bar. During realtime bars the *previous* bar's stop value is used. This approach, while slightly delayed compared to using the built-in trailing stop described in the FAQ entry about how to place a trailing stop loss [using built-in trailing stop functionality](#using-built-in-trailing-stop-functionality), ensures that the
  trailing stop price is not subject to assumptions about intrabar price movements, and thus avoids repainting.

### [How can I set a time-based condition to close out a position?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-set-a-time-based-condition-to-close-out-a-position)

To close positions after a certain amount of time has passed, track the entry time for each trade and close the position using [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) after the timeout.

Because strategies calculate at the close of each bar on historical data, time-based conditions can only be evaluated at the close, so **trade times are assessed in multiples of the chart bar's duration**. Further, if the timeout value is not divisible by the duration of a chart bar, each trade will last at least one additional chart bar. For instance, setting a timeout of 100 seconds on a 1-minute chart effectively means a minimum of two bars before a position can be closed.

In realtime, the same logic applies unless the strategy uses the [calc_on_every_tick](#calc_on_every_tick) parameter, in which case the trade closes as soon as the first tick exceeds the timeout value. Remember that [altering emulator behavior](#altering-calculation-behavior) typically introduces [repainting](#repainting).

The following example script calculates the duration of each open trade by comparing the current time against the trade entry time. If a trade's duration exceeds the specified timeout, the script closes the trade and marks the event with a comment on the chart including the trade's duration in seconds.

closePositionsAfter(int timeoutInSeconds) =>
    if strategy.opentrades > 0
        for i = 0 to strategy.opentrades - 1
            int timeNow = barstate.isrealtime ? timenow : time_close
            int tradeDurationInSeconds = (timeNow - strategy.opentrades.entry_time(i)) / 1000
            if tradeDurationInSeconds >= timeoutInSeconds
                string entryName    = strategy.opentrades.entry_id(i)
                string tradeComment = str.format("Close \"{0}\" by timeout {1}s", entryName, tradeDurationInSeconds)
                strategy.close(entryName, comment = tradeComment, immediately = true)

// Create long and short conditions based on the crossover/under of 2 moving averages.
bool longCondition  = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close,  14), ta.sma(close, 28))
bool shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))

// Place long entry order upon `longCondition`.
if longCondition
    strategy.entry("long", strategy.long)
// Place short entry order upon `shortCondition`.
if shortCondition
    strategy.entry("short", strategy.short)

// Close positions after a configurable number of seconds.               
closePositionsAfter(input(1200, "Timeout (seconds)"))
```

**Note that:**

- The script uses either the time of the bar's close using the [time_close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time_close) variable, or the current time from the [timenow](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timenow) variable (if the strategy uses the [calc_on_every_tick](#calc_on_every_tick) parameter).
- The script uses the [built-in](#built-ins) functions [strategy.opentrades.entry_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.opentrades.entry_time) and [strategy.opentrades.entry_id()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.opentrades.entry_id) to measure trade duration and identify individual trades.
- The [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) function uses the `immediately` argument to simulate trades at the end of the bar that exceeds the timer, rather than waiting for the opening of the next bar. Consequently, when a 120-second timeout is applied and the script runs on a 1-minute chart, it gives the appearance that trades last exactly two bars.

### [How can I configure a bracket order with a specific risk-to-reward (R:R
) ratio?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-configure-a-bracket-order-with-a-specific-risk-to-reward-rr-ratio)

To create a bracket order, define a stop-loss and a take-profit order using a single [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call.
To apply a specific risk-to-reward ratio, calculate the distance between the entry point and the stop-loss level. This stop distance represents the "risk". Then place the take-profit order a certain multiple of the stop distance away. The distance to the take-profit order represents the "reward", and the ratio between them is the risk:reward
 (R:R
) ratio.

The following example script simulates long and short trades using inputs to define the stop distance in ticks and the R:R
 ratio. The `loss` parameter of the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function is simply the stop distance. The `profit` parameter is the stop distance multiplied by the R:R
 ratio. The script fills the areas between the entry and stop-loss points, and between the entry and take-profit points, to illustrate the risk and reward.

### [How can I risk a fixed percentage of my equity per trade?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-risk-a-fixed-percentage-of-my-equity-per-trade)

Adjusting the position size to risk a fixed percentage of equity normalizes risk exposure, regardless of equity fluctuations, and helps avoid disproportionate risks across a strategy's trading history.

Calculate the position size so that as the stop distance increases, the position size decreases, and vice-versa, to maintain a constant risk percentage:

1. Calculate monetary *risk per contract* by multiplying the stop distance in ticks by the monetary value of each tick ([syminfo.mintick](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.mintick)) and by the number of units each contract represents ([syminfo.pointvalue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.pointvalue)).
2. Determine *risk amount* by multiplying the current equity ([strategy.equity](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.equity)) by the percentage of equity that you want to risk.
3. Calculate position size by dividing the *risk amount* by the *risk per contract*.

The following example script uses moving average crosses to generate long and short orders. The stop distance, risk:reward
 ratio, and percentage of equity to risk are all configurable via inputs.
The script plots the current equity, the current value of a new position, and the percentage change in equity to the Data Window. Note that the actual exposure level can be less than intended if the available capital does not divide neatly by the unit value, particularly with small equity amounts, high unit prices, or assets such as stocks where trading partial shares is not possible.

Additionally, we display lines on the chart for the current total equity (in green) and the value of a position needed for the specified risk exposure at the current price (in blue). If the position value exceeds the total equity, the strategy requires leverage to achieve the required exposure, and the script colors the background red and displays the minimum leverage ratio needed in the data window.

**Note that:**

- The stop distance in our example script is set to a constant value for demonstration purposes. In practice, the stop distance normally varies for each trade.

## [Strategy optimization and testing](https://www.tradingview.com#strategy-optimization-and-testing)

### [Why did my trade results change dramatically overnight?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-did-my-trade-results-change-dramatically-overnight)

Strategy results can vary over time depending on where the historical data starts. The starting point of the data set aligns with the start of the nearest day, week, month or year, depending on the chart timeframe. Additionally, different TradingView plans provide access to varying amounts of historical bars. Refer to the User Manual entry on [starting points](#starting-points) for a discussion of these factors.

For strategies, this means the historical results seen today might change as the dataset's starting point moves. This can lead to a natural [repainting](#repainting) of strategy results over time. To reduce the effect of these changes on backtesting, follow these tips:

**Export strategy results**

Regularly [exporting strategy results](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000613680-how-can-i-export-strategy-data/) to file maintains a record of performance over time despite changes in historical data. Use the "Export Data" option in the top of the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) to export data.

**Use Deep Backtesting**

Users with [Premium and higher plans](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/) have access to the [Deep Backtesting](https://www.tradingview.com/support/folders/43000584695/) feature, which provides results from the entire available dataset of a symbol. Deep Backtesting results are displayed in the Strategy Tester but are not visible on the chart.

**Use Bar Replay**

Use the Bar Replay feature on the first chart bar to extend the dataset backward, allowing a strategy to run on an additional full dataset prior to the current range. This process can be repeated a few times to analyze multiple datasets.

### [Why is backtesting on Heikin Ashi and other non-standard charts not recommended?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-is-backtesting-on-heikin-ashi-and-other-non-standard-charts-not-recommended)

[Range Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000474007-what-s-range-interval-and-how-do-i-select-it/)
offer unique perspectives on price action. However, these chart types are not suited for [strategy backtesting](#notes-on-testing-strategies) or automated trading systems execution, because the prices and time intervals do not match market prices and times.

[Range Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000474007-what-s-range-interval-and-how-do-i-select-it/)
simplify price action, losing some price detail. [Heikin Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000619436-heikin-ashi/) charts calculate synthetic prices for each bar's
[open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
[high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
[low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low),
and [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
(OHLC) values based on averages.

Further, all non-standard chart types with the exception of [Heikin Ashi](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000619436-heikin-ashi/) charts form new price units based on price movement only and omit the element of time.

Both the distortion of price data and the omission of time in non-standard charts lead to unrealistic and potentially misleading backtesting results.

Programmers can specify the `fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc` parameter of the [strategy](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration, which causes the strategy to calculate on standard chart data even if the current view is of Heikin Ashi candles. The user can do the same thing by by enabling the "Fill orders on standard OHLC" option in the strategy's [properties](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000628599). This option has no effect on other non-standard chart types, because they use non-standard time as well as price.

For a more detailed analysis of how non-standard chart types affect strategy results, refer to [this script](https://www.tradingview.com/script/q9laJNG9-Backtesting-on-Non-Standard-Charts-Caution-PineCoders-FAQ/) from the [PineCoders](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/) account.

### [How can I backtest deeper into history?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-backtest-deeper-into-history)

Different TradingView [plans](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/) give access to different amounts of historical information. To conduct more comprehensive backtesting in Pine Script, exploring further into an asset's historical data, use Bar Replay or Deep Backtesting.

**Bar Replay**

Starting the [Bar Replay](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000712747-what-is-bar-replay/) from the first chart bar in history effectively rolls back the dataset to an earlier point in time. Each iteration of the bar replay extends the dataset further back, offering analysis of multiple historical datasets. However, there is a limit to the number of times this process can be repeated. This method has the added benefit of visualizing the strategy's performance directly on the chart, which can be insightful for understanding trade entries, exits, and behavior during specific historical market conditions.

**Deep Backtesting**

For TradingView users with [Premium and higher plans](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/), the [Deep Backtesting](https://www.tradingview.com/support/folders/43000584695/) feature calculates the strategy on *all* historical data available for the selected symbol. The results are displayed in the Strategy Tester but are not visible on the chart. The results from Deep Backtesting might be different from results from the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) in regular mode, as explained in [this Help Center article](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000666266/).

### [How can I backtest multiple symbols?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-backtest-multiple-symbols)

Each Pine Script™ strategy runs on one symbol at a time. To evaluate a strategy across various markets or instruments:

- Apply the strategy to the chart and then switch the chart to the desired symbol.
- Use TradingView's watchlist feature to organize and quickly access different symbols.
- Export the results from the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) and use external tools such as spreadsheet software to compare the performance of a strategy on different symbols.

### [What does Bar Magnifier do?](https://www.tradingview.com#what-does-bar-magnifier-do)

The [Bar Magnifier](#bar-magnifier) feature, available for TradingView [Premium](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/) account holders, significantly enhances the accuracy of order fills in strategy backtests. This tool uses data from lower timeframes to obtain more detailed price movement within a bar, which can result in more precise
order fills. When selected, Bar Magnifier mode replaces the assumptions that the [broker emulator](#broker-emulator) must make about price movement using only a single set of OHLC values for each historical bar.

The Bar Magnifier chooses the lower timeframe based on the chart timeframe:

### [Can my strategy script place orders with TradingView brokers?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-my-strategy-script-place-orders-with-tradingview-brokers)

Pine Script™ strategies and indicators cannot directly place orders on exchanges.
Traders can use external tools or platforms that can interpret alert signals from Pine scripts using [webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/) and execute trades accordingly.

### [How can I add a time delay between orders?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-add-a-time-delay-between-orders)

Adding a time delay between orders can help to prevent too many trades in a short time. Strategies can also prevent trading for a time after a series of losses. Here's how to set up a time delay between orders:

- Define the delay duration, whether in time units (minutes, hours, days) or a number of bars. For time-based delays, convert the chosen time unit into milliseconds, because Pine [time variables](#time-variables) use milliseconds.
- Check the [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_time) or [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) of the last trade using [strategy.closedtrades.exit_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_time) or [strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index).
- If the difference between the current bar `time` or `bar_index` and that of the last trade's exit exceeds the delay duration, set a boolean flag to allow new orders. Make sure to include the flag in the strategy entry conditions.

The following example script provides two methods for delaying orders: a time-based delay or a specified number of bars. The strategy creates a long entry order when either the `time` of a bar or its `bar_index` exceeds the set delay from the last active trade bar. No other conditions are used for entry in this demonstration, but users can add their own logic to these conditions.

To keep the chart clean, the script calls the [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) function to close active trades after they have been open for 10 bars. The script uses background shading, labels and arrows to illustrate the trade entries and exits.

    strategy.close("Long")
bgcolor(entryCondition ? color.new(color.lime, 85) : tradeExited ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 85) : na)
```

Consider the following limitations when adding time-based delays.

**Historical bars**

Strategies [calculate at the close](#calculation-based-on-historical-bars) of each bar, so they can only evaluate time-based conditions at that moment. This constraint entails that on historical bars, **delay times are assessed in increments equal to the chart bar's duration**.

**Session times**

Strategies cannot evaluate delays when the market is closed, because there are no price updates to trigger script execution. This means that if a delay extends beyond the end of a trading session, the delay condition cannot be identified until the script runs again on the next session, resulting in a longer-than-anticipated time between orders.

**Delay duration on different timeframes**

If the delay value is not divisible by the duration of a chart bar, each delay lasts at least one additional chart bar. For instance, setting a delay of 100 seconds on a 1-minute chart effectively means a minimum of two bars before the delay is exceeded.

### [How can I calculate custom statistics in a strategy?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-calculate-custom-statistics-in-a-strategy)

To track metrics other than the default metrics that the Strategy Tester tracks, strategies can calculate custom statistics. These calculations might need to detect order executions, track closed trades, monitor entries into trades, and assess whether a trade is active. Changes in [built-in](#built-in-variables) variables such as [strategy.opentrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.opentrades) and [strategy.closedtrades](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.closedtrades) can track the execution of orders.

The following example script uses a moving average crossover strategy to generate orders. It calculates custom metrics, including the price risk at entry, average position size, and the average percentage of bars involved in trades across the dataset, and plots the custom metrics and some built-in variables to the Data Window. Users can view the history of values plotted in the Data Window by moving the cursor over any bar. In contrast, the Strategy Tester summarizes data over the entire testing period.

**Note that:**

- The strategy incorporates [trading costs](#simulating-trading-costs). Failing to account for these costs can lead to an unrealistic perception of strategy performance and diminish the credibility of test results.
- We round the
  [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open),
  [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high),
  [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) and
  [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close)
  (OHLC) built-in variables to the symbol's precision. This rounding ensures that any statistics the script calculates align within the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester) and with strategy order-related built-in variables.
- The script creates global variables for the changes in built-in variables for open and closed trades so that the [ta.change](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.change) function is called on every bar for consistency.

### [How do I incorporate leverage into my strategy?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-incorporate-leverage-into-my-strategy)

Trading with *leverage* means borrowing capital from a broker to control larger position sizes than the amount of capital risked. This amplifies both potential profits and losses, making it a powerful but risky tool. The amount of the trader's capital that they risk is called the *margin*.

For example, setting a 20% margin ratio means that the trader's balance funds only 20% of the position's value, allowing positions up to five times the account balance. A margin ratio of 20% is therefore the same as 5:1 leverage. With an available balance of $10,000 and a 20% margin setting, a strategy can open positions up to $50,000 in value.

Pine Script™ strategies can simulate trading with leverage by specifying margin requirements for long and short positions. Users can adjust the "Margin for long positions" and Margin for short positions" in the strategy's "Properties" tab. Programmers can set the default margin in the script using the `margin_long` and `margin_short` parameters in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration function.

For more information on using leverage in strategies, see the Help Center article [How do I simulate trading with leverage?](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000717375-how-do-i-simulate-trading-with-leverage/)

### [Can you hedge in a Pine Script strategy?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-you-hedge-in-a-pine-script-strategy)

When traders offset the risk of one position by opening another position at the same time, this is called *hedging*.

The main ways to hedge an open position are:

- By opening a second position in a related asset that is expected to move in the opposite direction to the first asset.
- By opening a short position to offset a long position or vice-versa.
- By using derivatives such as options.

Strategies cannot use these methods, because Pine strategies can only have positions open in one direction at a time, either long or short. Pine strategies run on only the chart asset and cannot open positions in different assets.

### [Can I connect my strategies to my paper trading account?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-connect-my-strategies-to-my-paper-trading-account)

Pine Script™ does not support placing orders using the brokers integrated via the Trading Panel, or using TradingView's built-in [paper trading account](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000516466-paper-trading-main-functionality/). The Strategy Tester closely mimics a paper trading account by simulating orders and tracking theoretical positions and capital in a risk-free environment.

Strategies can customize [order fill alerts](#strategy-alerts) to include detailed results and performance metrics in the alert strings, providing a record of the strategy's theoretical fills and overall performance in realtime.

## [Troubleshooting and specific issues](https://www.tradingview.com#troubleshooting-and-specific-issues)

### [Why are no trades executed after I add the strategy to the chart?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-are-no-trades-executed-after-i-add-the-strategy-to-the-chart)

If a strategy that is running on the chart does not place any orders, the Strategy Tester's "Overview" tab displays the message, "This strategy did not generate any orders throughout the testing range."
By contrast, while no strategy is loaded and visible on the chart, the Strategy Tester displays a different message: "To test a strategy, apply it to the chart."

If a valid script that uses the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement is running but is not placing any orders, consider the following potential problems and their solutions:

**Lack of order placement commands**

The strategy must use either the [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order) or [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) order [placement commands](#order-placement-and-cancellation) to place orders. Add [log.info](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_log.info) messages and review the Pine Logs to check whether the conditions to run the commands are met.

**Insufficient capital**

Verify that the strategy has enough initial capital to cover the position sizes it attempts to open. Remember, the cost of entering a futures contract position is the chart price multiplied by the [syminfo.pointvalue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.pointvalue), which can be significantly greater than the chart price. For a quick fix, increase the initial capital to a very high value in the *Properties* tab.

**Runtime errors**

Check for runtime errors indicated by a red exclamation mark on the chart pane next to the script's title. Resolve any issues by correcting the script as necessary.

For more detailed guidance and troubleshooting tips, refer to the dedicated article on this topic in the [Help Center](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000478450-i-ve-successfully-added-a-strategy-to-my-chart-but-it-doesn-t-generate-orders/).

### [Why does my strategy not place any orders on recent bars?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-does-my-strategy-not-place-any-orders-on-recent-bars)

If a strategy places one or more orders early in the testing range but then stops placing orders, check the following issues.

**Total account loss**

Check whether the simulated account balance experienced a total loss of equity earlier in the available history. As a result, the account might lack sufficient capital to continue trading the symbol and fail to show trades only in the chart's recent history.

**No exit condition**

Some programmers define entry conditions that rely on having no positions currently open. Make sure to explicitly close trades by specifying corresponding exit conditions for all trades. Without explicit instructions to close an open position using [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close) or [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) commands, the strategy might display only a single entry order early in the chart's history and in the *List of Trades* tab. If trades are not closed, they do not generate results in the *Overview*.

### [Why is my strategy repainting?](https://www.tradingview.com#why-is-my-strategy-repainting)

Pine scripts *repaint* if they behave differently on historical and realtime bars. If strategies repaint, their backtesting results are not reliable because they do not accurately represent the strategy's behavior in realtime.

Some strategy properties cause repainting:

- The [calc_on_every_tick](#calc_on_every_tick) setting causes a strategy to recalculate with every price update, which may cause orders and alerts to trigger during the formation of a bar in realtime. By contrast, on historical bars, calculations are performed at the close of the bar.
- The [calc_on_order_fills](#calc_on_order_fills) setting causes a strategy to recalculate immediately after simulating an order fill. For example, this feature is particularly useful for strategies that rely on entry prices to set exit prices on the entry bar, rather than waiting for the bar to close, such as the first example script in the FAQ entry [How can I set stop-loss and take-profit levels as a percentage from my entry point using `calc_on_order_fills`?](#using-calc_on_order_fills) However, using this setting can introduce *lookahead bias* into the strategy, leading to potentially unrealistic outcomes. For instance, if a strategy's entry conditions are met within a bar that also triggers an exit, the strategy would execute an entry order within the same bar on the next tick. On historical bars, such entries could occur at any of the bar's [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low), or [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) (OHLC) prices, resulting in entry prices that are unrealistically favorable.
- Since strategies and their alerts execute at the close of a historical bar, the next possible moment for an entry order to be filled is the beginning of the next bar. However, the [process_orders_on_close](#process_orders_on_close) setting causes the strategy to use the close price of the bar where the condition is met for its order prices instead. See the FAQ entry [Why are my orders executed on the bar following my triggers?](#why-are-my-orders-executed-on-the-bar-following-my-triggers) for more information.

To avoid repainting, set the [calc_on_every_tick](#calc_on_every_tick), [calc_on_order_fills](#calc_on_order_fills), and [process_orders_on_close](#process_orders_on_close) parameters to `false` in the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) declaration statement.

Additionally, using unfixed data from a higher timeframe can cause repainting. If the data from the higher timeframe changes during the higher timeframe bar, this can change the script's oputput for historical bars.
Ensure that strategies use only fixed values from a higher timeframe, as described in [Avoiding repainting](#avoiding-repainting).

Although these are the most common causes of repainting in strategies, they are not the only causes. For additional information, refer to the section on [repainting](#repainting) in the User Manual.

### [How do I turn off alerts for stop loss and take profit orders?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-turn-off-alerts-for-stop-loss-and-take-profit-orders)

In automated trading strategies, it is common practice to set stop-loss and take-profit orders at the same time as an entry order, using the alert from the entry order as a trigger. In this case, sending alerts for the stop-loss and take-profit order fills can be unnecessary or even problematic. To disable alerts for a specific order placement command, set the `disable_alert` parameter to `true`. The broker emulator still simulates the fills for these orders, but sends no alerts for them.

Here is an example of an order fill command with this parameter set:

```
strategy.exit("Exit", stop = stopLevel, limit = limitLevel, disable_alert = true)
```

## [How can I place text on the chart?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-place-text-on-the-chart)

Scripts can display text using the following methods:

- The [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar) or [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) functions for static text, which doesn't change.

- [Tables](#tables) for more complex text (static or dynamic) that stays in the same region of the chart.

### [Plotting text](https://www.tradingview.com#plotting-text)

The [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar) and [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) functions can display fixed text on bars:

- A single [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar) function call can print a string using the `text` parameter, but only one character using the `char` parameter. To plot only the text and not the character, set `char` to `""`.
- A [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) function call can print a string using the `text` parameter. To plot only the text and not the shape, set the `color` (for the shape) to [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) and the `textcolor` to something visible.

Plots appears on the bar where the script calls the function, by default, but scripts can offset a plot by a dynamic number of bars to the left or right. On the Y axis, the plots appear above/below the bar, at the top/bottom of the chart, or at an arbitrary price level. Scripts can call a [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar) or [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) function on any number of bars and it counts as a single plot towards the [plot limit](#plot-limits).

When using these functions, the text cannot change during the execution of the script. The `text` parameter accepts an argument of type "const string", which means it cannot cannot change from bar to bar and cannot be supplied by an input.

This script, for example, does not compile, because the argument to the `text` parameter is a "series string":

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting text demo: incorrect", overlay = true)
float rsi   = ta.rsi(close, 14)
bool  rsiUp = ta.crossover( rsi, 50)
bool  rsiDn = ta.crossunder(rsi, 50)
string txt = rsiUp ? "RSI\nUp" : rsiDn ? "RSI\nDown" : ""
plotchar(series = rsiUp or rsiDn, title = "Up/Down", char = "R", text = txt, location = location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

To print different text depending on a logical condition, use two function calls and control them using the `series` parameter. Note that even if the `series` for one or both of the function calls is never true during a script's execution, and so no shape, character or text is ever plotted, *both* functions still count towards the [plot limit](#plot-limits).

The following script corrects the earlier example, and shows the use of both [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar) and [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) to display text:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Plotting text demo", overlay = true)
float rsi   = ta.rsi(close, 14)
bool  rsiUp = ta.crossover( rsi, 50)
bool  rsiDn = ta.crossunder(rsi, 50)
plotchar( series = rsiUp, title = "Up", char = "▲", location = location.belowbar, 
  color = color.lime, text = "RSI\nUp", size = size.tiny)
plotshape(series = rsiDn, title = "Down", style = shape.triangledown, location = location.abovebar, 
  color = color.fuchsia, text = "RSI\nDown", size = size.tiny, textcolor = color.fuchsia)
```

### [Labels](https://www.tradingview.com#labels)

[Labels](#labels) are particularly useful for displaying text that can change from one bar to another. The `text` parameter of the [label.new](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) function takes a "series string", so it can change whenever necessary.

Labels do not count towards the [plot limit](#plot-limits), but there is a separate limit of how many labels can display on the chart. By default, up to approximately 50 of the *most recent* labels appear on the chart. Programmers can adjust this limit up to 500 by setting the `max_labels_count` parameter in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) functions.

The parameters to the [label.new](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) function for text, color, etc., take "series" arguments. This makes labels much more flexible than plots.

The following example script displays the same information as the previous script, but using labels. The background to the labels is transparent (set to [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na)) in this example, to more closely match the style of the previous scripts.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Drawing labels demo", "", true)
float rsi   = ta.rsi(close, 14)
bool  rsiUp = ta.crossover( rsi, 50)
bool  rsiDn = ta.crossunder(rsi, 50)
if rsiUp or rsiDn
    string labelText = rsiUp ? "▲\nRSI Up"   : "RSI Down\n▼"
    color  textColor = rsiUp ? color.lime    : color.fuchsia
    string labelPos  = rsiUp ? yloc.belowbar : yloc.abovebar
    label.new(bar_index, na, labelText, yloc = labelPos, color = color(na), textcolor = textColor)
```

As well as showing historical information, labels can also be used to show only the latest information on the current bar. The following example script displays the value of RSI in a different color depending on whether it is above or below 50, for the most recent bar only. This is not possible using [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar) or [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape), because the text is fixed, and too many plots would be required to plot every value separately.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Single label demo", "", true)
float rsi        = ta.rsi(close, 14)
bool  rsiAbove50 = rsi >= 50
bool  rsiBelow50 = rsi < 50

var label rsiLabel = label.new(na, na, style = label.style_label_left, yloc = yloc.price,
  color = color.new(color.gray,70))

if barstate.islast
    color  textColor = rsiAbove50 ? color.lime : rsiBelow50 ? color.fuchsia : color(na)
    rsiLabel.set_x(bar_index + 1)
    rsiLabel.set_y(open)
    rsiLabel.set_text(str.format("RSI: {0, number, #.##}", rsi))
    rsiLabel.set_textcolor(textColor)
```

Note that:

- We create the label once, on the first bar, with all its unchanging properties such as style and background color already set.
- We do nothing with the label for all historical bars.
- We update the changing properties of the label such as text and position on the most recent bar and on every realtime bar. This method is more performant than updating the label on all bars or creating and deleting it each bar.

### [Boxes](https://www.tradingview.com#boxes)

[Boxes](#boxes) can also display text on the chart, by providing the text to the `text` parameter of the [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new) function. Boxes work with text in a similar way to labels, but with some additional features.

Labels exist specifically to display text — and so the label adjusts to the size of the text. Labels always resize so that all of the text is visible inside of the label.

The main use of boxes is to display the drawing itself. A box attaches to specific points on the chart, and its text might or might not fit into it. To ensure that the text displays in the best possible way, boxes provide some additional features that can not be used in labels: text wrapping and text alignment.

Text contained in the box can automatically wrap if it reaches the border of the box, if the `text_wrap` parameter is set to `text.wrap_auto`. Additionally, scripts can align the text inside the box along the vertical and horizontal axes. Using the `text_halign` and `text_valign` parameters of `box.new()`, text can display at one of the nine possible positions inside of the box.

In the example below, we draw a box that spans the last 50 historical bars on the chart, and a label. We add long text to both. With `text_wrap = text.wrap_auto`, the text inside the box automatically wraps to fit the box itself, while the text inside of the label stays unchanged:

![image](images/Strings-and-formatting-Boxes.DGNthdsU_Aug9o.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Box and label text", overlay = true)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    bt = "This long text is inside of a box, which means it is automatically wrapped and scaled to be visible in the constraints of the box."
    lt = "This long text is inside of a label, which means that it is displayed as is, and the label is simply drawn around it. It doesn't change when the chart is scaled."
    box.new(bar_index[50], close * 1.1, bar_index, close, text = bt, text_wrap = text.wrap_auto, text_size = 36)
    label.new(bar_index[25], close * 1.1, lt, size = 36)
```

### [Tables](https://www.tradingview.com#tables)

[Tables](#tables) are useful to display information in a fixed position on the chart. Whereas plots and labels can easily show historical information because they are, or can be, linked to specific bars, table contents do not change as users move the cursor over past chart bars. This makes tables best suited for showing *current* information.

The following example script displays the value of RSI in a different color depending on whether it is above or below 50, for the most recent bar only.

```
//@version=6
indicator("RSI table", "", true)

var table rsiDisplay = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1, bgcolor = color.gray, frame_width = 2, frame_color = color.black)
float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14)

bool  rsiAbove50 = rsi >= 50
bool  rsiBelow50 = rsi < 50

color textColor = rsiAbove50 ? color.lime : rsiBelow50 ? color.fuchsia : color(na)

if barstate.isfirst
    table.cell(rsiDisplay, 0, 0, "")
else if barstate.islast
    table.cell_set_text(rsiDisplay, 0, 0, str.format("RSI: {0, number, #.##}", rsi))
    table.cell_set_text_color(rsiDisplay, 0, 0, textColor)
```

Note that:

- We create the table and its single cell only once, and update the text and color on the most recent bar and on every realtime bar, for performance.
- This script displays the same information as the preceding example did using a label.
- Although this is a simple example, for more complex information, tables are easier to organise and read than labels.

## [How can I position text on either side of a single bar?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-position-text-on-either-side-of-a-single-bar)

Scripts can position a label to the *right* of a bar by using `style = label.style_label_left`. This style *points* the label to the **right** and *places* it to the **left**. Likewise, a label with `style = label.style_label_right` displays to the right of the bar, pointing left.

To manage the alignment of the text within the label, use the `textalign` parameter.

The following example script draws three labels on the chart's last bar, with different `style` and `textalign` values. User inputs control whether individual labels appear, and the central label is off by default for readability. If the input to hide the background is enabled, the color is set to [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) so that it does not appear. Note that the proper way to do this is to cast it to a color by using `color(na)`.

![image](images/Strings-and-formatting-How-can-i-position-text-on-either-side-of-a-single-bar-1.DUFIx4_a_Z2b7mR6.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Text position demo", "", true)

hideBackgroundInput = input.bool(false, "Hide Background")
color backgroundColor = hideBackgroundInput ? color(na) : color.new(color.gray,70)
// @function            Prints a label with the specified text at a specific position and alignment.
// @param txt           (string) The text to be displayed in the label.
// @param pos           (string) The label style.
// @param align         (string) The horizontal alignment of text within the label.
// @returns             (void) Function has no explicit return.
print(string txt, string pos, string align) =>
    var label lbl = label.new(na, na, na, xloc.bar_index, yloc.price, backgroundColor, pos, chart.fg_color,
      size.huge, align, text_font_family = font.family_monospace)
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(lbl, txt)

if input.bool(true, "Show Left Label")
    print("label_left\ntext.align_left", label.style_label_left,   text.align_left)
if input.bool(true, "Show Right Label")
    print("label_right\ntext.align_right", label.style_label_right,  text.align_right)
if input.bool(false, "Show Center Label")
    print("label_center\nalign_center",  label.style_label_center, text.align_center)
```

## [How can I stack plotshape() text?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-stack-plotshape-text)

To make multiple text plots visible on the same bar, the text on one plot must be raised or lowered so that it does not overlap with another plot.

To add a blank line in a [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar) or [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) call, add the newline character `\n` and the non-printable special character U+200E. This Unicode character, also known as the "Left-to-Right Mark", is a "Zero Width Space" used to control the directionality of text display, without adding any actual
space or visible content. The Pine Editor represents this character as [U+200E] highlighted in red. Typing `[U+200E]` does not render the special character; it needs to be copied from a Unicode generator, from the script below, or from here: `‎`

The following example script shows how to insert a blank line over or under other text:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Stack text demo", "", true)

plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowup,   location.abovebar, color.green,  textcolor = color.green,  text = "A")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowup,   location.abovebar, color.lime,   textcolor = color.lime,   text = "B\n‎")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.red,    textcolor = color.red,    text = "C")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.maroon, textcolor = color.maroon, text = "‎\nD")
```

## [How can I print a value at the top right of the chart?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-print-a-value-at-the-top-right-of-the-chart)

To print a value at the top right of the chart, refer to [this](#placing-a-single-value-in-a-fixed-position) example in the User Manual, which uses a [table](#tables) for this purpose.

## [How can I split a string into characters?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-split-a-string-into-characters)

The [str.split()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_str.split) function splits a string into parts and stores the parts in an array.
To split a string into individual characters, use an empty string `""` as the `separator` argument. Here is a code example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Split a string into characters")

string sourceStringInput = input.string("123456789", "String to Split")
var array<string> charactersArray = str.split(sourceStringInput, "")

if barstate.islast
    string txt = sourceStringInput + "\n" + str.tostring(charactersArray)
    var label = label.new(na, na, txt, xloc.bar_index, yloc.price, color(na), label.style_label_left, chart.fg_color, size.large, text.align_left)
    label.set_xy(label, bar_index, open)
```

# [Techniques](https://www.tradingview.com#techniques)

## [How can I prevent the "Bar index value of the `x` argument is too far from the current bar index. Try using `time` instead" and "Objects positioned using xloc.bar_index cannot be drawn further than X bars into the future" errors?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-prevent-the-bar-index-value-of-the-x-argument-is-too-far-from-the-current-bar-index-try-using-time-instead-and-objects-positioned-using-xlocbar_index-cannot-be-drawn-further-than-x-bars-into-the-future-errors)

Both these errors occur when creating objects too distant from the current bar. An x point on a [line](#lines), [label](#labels), or [box](#boxes) can not be more than 9999 bars in the past or more than 500 bars in the future relative to the bar on which the script draws it.

Scripts *can* draw objects beyond these limits, however, using [xloc.bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time) instead of the `xloc` parameter, and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) as an alternative to [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) for the `x` arguments.

Note that, by default, all drawings use `xloc.bar_index`, which means that the values passed to their `x`-coordinates are treated as if they are bar indices. If drawings use a `time`-based value without specifying `xloc = xloc.bar_time`, the timestamp — which is usually an `int` value of trillions of milliseconds — is treated as an index of a bar in the future, and inevitably exceeds the 500 future bars limit. To use `time`-based values for drawings, always specify `xloc.bar_time`.

## [How can I update the right side of all lines or boxes?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-update-the-right-side-of-all-lines-or-boxes)

Scripts can update the `x2` value of all lines or boxes by storing them in an array and using a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_for...in) loop to iterate over each object. Update the `x2` value using the [line.set_x2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_x2) or [box.set_right()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_right)
functions.

In the example below, we create a custom array and go over it to extend lines with each new bar:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Update x2 demo", "", true)

int activeLevelsInput = input.int(10, "Number of levels")
int pivotLegsInput    = input.int(5,  "Pivot length")

// Save pivot prices.
float pHi = ta.pivothigh(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput)
// Initialize an array for lines on the first bar, sized to match the number of levels to track.
var array<line> pivotLines = array.new<line>(activeLevelsInput)

// Check for a pivot. Add a new line to the array. Remove and delete the oldest line.
if not na(pHi)
    line newPivotLine = line.new(bar_index[pivotLegsInput], pHi, bar_index, pHi)
    pivotLines.push(newPivotLine)
    pivotLines.shift().delete()

// Update all line x2 values.
if barstate.islast
    for eachLine in pivotLines
        eachLine.set_x2(bar_index)
```

As an alternative to adding new drawings to a custom array, scripts can use the appropriate built-in variable that collects all instances of a drawing type. These arrays use the `<drawingNamespace>.all` naming scheme: for example, scritps can access all drawn labels by referring to [label.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_label.all), all polylines with [polyline.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_polyline.all), etc. Scripts can iterate over these arrays in the same way as with custom arrays.

This example implements gets the same result using the [line.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_line.all) built-in array instead:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Update x2 demo", "", true)

int activeLevelsInput = input.int(10, "Number of levels")
int pivotLegsInput    = input.int(5,  "Pivot length")

// Save pivot prices.
float pHi = ta.pivothigh(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput)

// Check for a pivot. Delete the oldest line if the array is over the "Number of levels" limit.
if not na(pHi)
    line newPivotLine = line.new(bar_index[pivotLegsInput], pHi, bar_index, pHi)
    if line.all.size() > activeLevelsInput
        line.all.first().delete()

// Update all line x2 values.
if barstate.islast
    for eachLine in line.all
        eachLine.set_x2(bar_index)
```

## [How to avoid repainting when *not* using the `request.security()` function?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-to-avoid-repainting-when-not-using-the-requestsecurity-function)

Scripts can give deceptive output if they [repaint](#repainting) by behaving differently on historical and elapsed realtime bars. This type of repainting is most commonly caused by requesting data from another context using the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function.

Scripts can also change their output during a realtime bar, as the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume), [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) values change. This form of repainting is not normally deceptive or detrimental.

To avoid this kind of repainting and ensure that outputs do not change during a bar, consider the following options:

- Use confirmed values, or the values from the previous bar.
- Set alerts to fire on bar close. Read more about repainting alerts in the FAQ entry [Why is my alert firing at the wrong time?](#why-is-my-alert-firing-at-the-wrong-time)
- Use the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) in calculations instead of the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close).

For further exploration of these methods, see the PineCoders publication ["How to avoid repainting when NOT using security()"](https://www.tradingview.com/script/s8kWs84i-How-to-avoid-repainting-when-NOT-using-security/).

## [How can I trigger a condition n bars after it last occurred?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-trigger-a-condition-n-bars-after-it-last-occurred)

Using the [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) function, scripts can implement a condition when a certain number of bars have elapsed since the last occurrence of that condition.

The following example script uses the `cond` condition to plot a blue star when the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) value is greater than the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) value for two consecutive bars. Then, the `trigger` variable is true only if the `cond` condition is already true *and* the number of bars elapsed since `cond` was last true is greater than `lengthInput`. The script plots a red "O" on the chart, overlaying the blue star, each time these conditions are met. The Data Window displays the count since `cond` was last true.

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-i-trigger-a-condition-only-when-a-number-of-bars-have-elapsed-since-the-last-condition-occured-1.Dt02f4F1_Zi4RzG.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`barssince` demo", overlay = true)
int  lengthInput = input.int(3, "Length")
bool cond = close > open and close[1] > open[1]
int  count = ta.barssince(cond[1]) + 1
bool trigger = cond and count > lengthInput
plot(cond ? 0 : count, "Count", display = display.data_window)
plotchar(cond)
plotchar(trigger, "", "O", color = color.red)
```

## [How can my script identify what chart type is active?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-my-script-identify-what-chart-type-is-active)

Various boolean [built-in](#built-ins) variables within the `chart.*` namespace enable a script to detect the type of chart it is running on.

The following example script defines a function, `chartTypeToString()`, which uses the `chart.*` built-ins to identify the chart type and convert this information into
a string. It then displays the detected chart type in a table on the chart.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Chart type", "", true)

chartTypeToString() =>
    string result = switch
        chart.is_standard   => "Standard"
        chart.is_heikinashi => "Heikin-Ashi"
        chart.is_kagi       => "Kagi"
        chart.is_linebreak  => "Line Break"
        chart.is_pnf        => "Point and Figure"
        chart.is_range      => "Range"
        chart.is_renko      => "Renko"

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var table display = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, bgcolor = chart.fg_color)
    table.cell(display, 0, 0, str.format("Chart type: {0}", chartTypeToString()), text_color = chart.bg_color)
```

## [How can I plot the highest and lowest visible candle values?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-plot-the-highest-and-lowest-visible-candle-values)

To plot the highest [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) and lowest [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) within the range of visible bars, a script can use the [chart.left_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right_visible_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) built-ins. These variables allow the script to identify the times of the earliest and latest visible bars on the chart and calculate the maximum or minimum values within that range.

The [VisibleChart](https://www.tradingview.com/script/j7vCseM2-VisibleChart/) library by [PineCoders](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/) offers such functionality with its `high()` and `low()` functions, which dynamically calculate the highest and lowest values of the currently visible bars.

The following example script uses functions from this library to create two horizontal [lines](#lines) on the chart, signifying the highest and lowest price points within the range of visible bars. The script draws [labels](#labels) for these lines, displaying both the price and the corresponding timestamp for each high and low point. As the chart is manipulated through scrolling or zooming, these lines and labels dynamically update to reflect the highest and lowest values of the newly visible bars:

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-i-plot-the-charts-visible-high-and-low-1.C8tRKhQr_Z2todXY.png)

```

**Note that:**

- Values derived from visible chart variables can change throughout the script's runtime. To accurately reflect the entire visible range, the script defers drawing the lines until the last bar (using [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast)).
- Because the visible chart values are defined in the [global scope](#what-does-scope-mean), *outside* the local block defined by [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast), the functions process the entire dataset before determining the final high and low values.

For more information, refer to the [VisibleChart](https://www.tradingview.com/script/j7vCseM2-VisibleChart/) library's documentation.

## [How to remember the last time a condition occurred?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-to-remember-the-last-time-a-condition-occurred)

Scripts can store the number of bars between the current bar and a bar on which a condition occurred in various ways:

- Using [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince). This built-in function is the simplest way to track the distance from the condition.
- Manually replicating the functionality of [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) by initializing the distance to zero when the condition occurs, then incrementing it by one on each bar, resetting it if the condition occurs again.
- Saving the [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) when the condition occurs, and calculating the difference from the current [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).

Programmers can then use the number of bars with the [history-referencing operator []](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D) to retrieve the value of a variable, such as the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close), on that bar.

Alternatively, if the script needs *only* the value itself and not the number of bars, simply save the value each time the condition occurs. This method is more efficient because it avoids referencing the series multiple times throughout its history. This method also reduces the risk of runtime errors in scripts if the size of the historical reference is [too large](#pine-script-cannot-determine-the-referencing-length-of-a-series-try-using-max_bars_back-in-the-indicator-or-strategy-function).

Here's a script that demonstrates these methods:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Track distance from condition", "", true)
// Plot the high/low from the bar where a condition occurred the last time.

// Conditions
bool upBar = close > open
bool dnBar = close < open
bool up3Bars = dnBar and upBar[1] and upBar[2] and upBar[3]
bool dn3Bars = upBar and dnBar[1] and dnBar[2] and dnBar[3]
display = display.data_window

// Method 1: Using "ta.barssince()".
plot(high[ta.barssince(up3Bars)], color = color.new(color.blue, 80), linewidth = 16)
plot(low[ta.barssince(dn3Bars)],  color = color.new(color.red,  80), linewidth = 16)
plot(ta.barssince(up3Bars), "1. ta.barssince(up3Bars)", display = display)
plot(ta.barssince(dn3Bars), "1. ta.barssince(dn3Bars)", display = display)

// Method 2: Manually replicating the functionality of the "ta.barssince()" function.
var int barsFromUp = na
var int barsFromDn = na
barsFromUp := up3Bars ? 0 : barsFromUp + 1
barsFromDn := dn3Bars ? 0 : barsFromDn + 1
plot(high[barsFromUp], color = color.blue, linewidth = 3)
plot(low[barsFromDn],  color = color.red,  linewidth = 3)
plot(barsFromUp, "3. barsFromUp", display = display)
plot(barsFromDn, "3. barsFromDn", display = display)

// Method 3: Storing the `bar_index` value when a condition is met.
var int barWhenUp = na
var int barWhenDn = na
if up3Bars
    barWhenUp := bar_index
if dn3Bars
    barWhenDn := bar_index
plot(high[bar_index - barWhenUp], color = color.new(color.blue, 70), linewidth = 8)
plot(low[bar_index  - barWhenDn], color = color.new(color.red,  70), linewidth = 8)
plot(bar_index - barWhenUp, "2. bar_index - barWhenUp", display = display)
plot(bar_index - barWhenDn, "2. bar_index - barWhenDn", display = display)

// Method 4: Storing the value when a condition is met.
var float highWhenUp = na
var float lowWhenDn  = na
if up3Bars
    highWhenUp := high
if dn3Bars
    lowWhenDn  := low

plot(highWhenUp, color = color.new(color.white, 70), linewidth = 1)
plot(lowWhenDn,  color = color.new(color.white, 70), linewidth = 1)
```

## [How can I plot the previous and current day's open?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-plot-the-previous-and-current-days-open)

There are several methods for plotting prices from a higher timeframe (we assume that these scripts are to be run on intraday timeframes).

### [Using `timeframe.change()`](https://www.tradingview.com#using-timeframechange)

The [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change) function identifies when a bar in a specified timeframe opens. When a new daily bar opens, the following example script first copies the existing daily opening value to the variable for the previous day, and then updates the opening price for the current day.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Previous and current day open using `timeframe.change()`", "", true)

bool newDay = timeframe.change("1D")
var float yesterdayOpen = na
var float todayOpen     = na

if newDay
    yesterdayOpen := todayOpen  // We reassign this value first
    todayOpen     := open  // and then store today's open

plot(yesterdayOpen, "Yesterday's Open", newDay ? na : color.red, 2, plot.style_line)
plot(todayOpen, "Today's Open", newDay ? na : color.green, 2, plot.style_line)
bgcolor(newDay ? color.new(color.gray, 80) : na)
```

**Note that:**

- This method uses the chart's timeframe transitions to establish open prices and does not make adjustments for session times.
- For some markets and instrument types, the intraday data and the daily data is expected to differ. For example, the US exchanges like NASDAQ and NYSE include more trades in daily bars than in intraday ones, which results in different OHLC values between intraday and daily data, and in daily volume being far greater than intraday one. As a result, the first [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) of a trading session on an intraday chart can differ from the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) of its respective 1D candle.

### [Using `request.security()`](https://www.tradingview.com#using-requestsecurity)

To match the values on the chart with the values on higher timeframe charts, it's necessary to access the higher timeframe data feeds. Scripts can achieve this by using the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function.

The following example script requests two data feeds from a higher timeframe. To reduce the risk of [repainting](#repainting), we use only confirmed values for historical bars. The script plots confirmed values retroactively on each preceding day when a new day begins. For the real-time bar of the higher timeframe, which represents the current day, we draw a separate set of lines. The realtime lines can change during the day. While this type of repainting is not apparent here when using the opening price, which does not change after the bar opens, it is more obvious for scripts that use the closing price, which takes the current price until the bar closes.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Previous and current day open using `request.security()`", "", true, max_lines_count = 500)

string periodInput = input.timeframe("1D", "Higher timeframe")

[htfOpen1, htfOpen2, htfTime, htfTimeClose] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, periodInput, [open[1], open[2], time[1], time_close[1]], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
[htfRtOpen, htfRtOpen1] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, periodInput, [open, open[1]])

var line rtOpen  = line.new(na, na, na, na, xloc.bar_time, color = color.lime)
var line rtOpen1 = line.new(na, na, na, na, xloc.bar_time, color = color.gray)
var int rtStart  = time
var int rtEnd    = time_close(periodInput)

if ta.change(htfTime)
    line.new(htfTime, htfOpen1, htfTimeClose, htfOpen1, xloc.bar_time, color = color.lime)
    line.new(htfTime, htfOpen2, htfTimeClose, htfOpen2, xloc.bar_time, color = color.gray)
    rtStart := time
    rtEnd   := time_close(periodInput)

line.set_xy1(rtOpen1, rtStart, htfRtOpen1), line.set_xy2(rtOpen1, rtEnd, htfRtOpen1)
line.set_xy1(rtOpen,  rtStart, htfRtOpen),  line.set_xy2(rtOpen,  rtEnd, htfRtOpen)

bgcolor(timeframe.change(periodInput) ? color.new(color.gray, 80) : na)
```

### [Using `timeframe`](https://www.tradingview.com#using-timeframe)

Instead of writing custom logic to retrieve or calculate prices for a particular timeframe, programmers can run the entire script in that timeframe.

If scripts include the `timeframe` parameter in the [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration, the user can choose the timeframe in which the script runs. The script can set a default timeframe.

By default, the following script plots the current and previous day's opening prices, similar to the previous examples. It is much simpler, but behaves quite differently. For historical bars, the script returns values when the day closes, effectively one day "late". For realtime and elapsed realtime bars, the script returns live values, if the option "Wait for timeframe closes" is not selected in the script settings.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Previous and current day open using `timeframe`", "", true, timeframe = "1D", timeframe_gaps = true)

plot(open[1], "Yesterday's Open", color.red,   2, plot.style_line)
plot(open,    "Today's Open",     color.green, 2, plot.style_line)
```

**Note that:**

- Only simple scripts that do not use drawings can use the `timeframe` parameter.
- Scripts that use the `timeframe` parameter can plot values quite differently depending on which settings are chosen. For an explanation, see [this Help Center article](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000591555/).

## [How can I count the occurrences of a condition in the last x bars?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-count-the-occurrences-of-a-condition-in-the-last-x-bars)

One obvious method is to use a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to retrospectively review each of the last x bars and check for the condition.
However, this method is inefficient, because it examines all bars in range *again* on every bar, even though it already examined all but the last bar.

In general, using unnecessary, large, or nested [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops can result in slower processing and longer chart loading times.

The simplest and most efficient method is to use the built-in [math.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sum) function, and pass it a conditional series to count. This function maintains a running total of the count as each bar is processed, and can take a [simple](#simple) or [series](#series) length.

The following example script uses both of these calculation methods. It also uses a series length that adjusts for the first part of the chart, where the number of bars available is less than the length. This way, the functions do not return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) values.

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-i-count-the-occurences-of-a-condition-in-the-last-x-bars-1.DjfPEBjE_Z2kXwuv.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Number of occurrences demo", overlay = false)

int lengthInput = input.int(100, "Length", minval = 1)

// Condition to count.
bool isUpBar = close > open

// Count using a loop (inefficient).
countWithLoop(bool condition, int length) =>
    int count = 0
    for i = 0 to length - 1
        if condition[i]
            count += 1
    count

// Count using Pine's built-in function. Can be "simple" or "series" length.
countWithSum(bool condition, int length) =>
    float result = math.sum(condition ? 1 : 0, length)

float v1 = countWithSum(isUpBar,  math.min(lengthInput, bar_index + 1))
int   v2 = countWithLoop(isUpBar, math.min(lengthInput, bar_index + 1))
plot(v1, "Efficient count",       color.red,   4)
plot(v2, "Inefficient count",     color.black, 1)
```

## [How can I implement an on/off switch?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-implement-an-onoff-switch)

An on/off switch is a persistent state that can be turned on once, and persists across bars until it is turned off. Scripts can use the [var](#var) keyword to initialize a variable only once, and maintain its most recent value across subsequent bars unless it is reassigned. Such persistent states can be boolean values, or integers, or any other type.

The following example script show how to implement this. Each instance of the on and off triggers displays with an arrow and the word "On" or "Off". A green background highlights the bars where the switch is in the "On" state.

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-i-implement-an-on-off-switch-1.B-YIPmBl_2lBAJC.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("On/Off condition example", overlay = true)

bool upBar = close > open

// On/off conditions.
bool triggerOn  = upBar and upBar[1] and upBar[2]
bool triggerOff = not upBar and not upBar[1]

// Switch state is saved across bars.
var bool onOffSwitch = false

// Turn the switch on or off, otherwise persist its state.
onOffSwitch := triggerOn ? true : triggerOff ? false : onOffSwitch

bgcolor(onOffSwitch ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na)
plotchar(triggerOn,  "triggerOn",  "▲", location.belowbar, color.lime, size = size.tiny, text = "On")
plotchar(triggerOff, "triggerOff", "▼", location.abovebar, color.red,  size = size.tiny, text = "Off")
```

## [How can I alternate conditions?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-alternate-conditions)

Scripts can alternate from one state to another strictly, even when the triggers to change state do not occur in strict order. This can be useful to mark only the first trigger and not any subsequent triggers, or to prevent multiple alerts.

The following example script plots all pivots, defined by Williams fractals. These pivots can occur in any order. The script stores the type of the most recent pivot, and confirms the next pivot *only* if it is of the opposite type, such that confirmed pivots appear strictly high-low-high or low-high-low, etc. Confirmed pivots are plotted in a larger size and different color. The chart background color is colored according to the type of the most recent confirmed pivot.

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-i-allow-transitions-from-condition-ab-or-ba-but-not-aa-nor-bb-1.9yOp6mtx_CkEYI.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Alternating states", "", true)

lookback = input.int(2, title="Lookback & Lookahead")

// Define an enum of allowed pivot types.
enum PivotType
    high
    low
    undefined

const color red80 = color.new(color.red, 80)
const color green80 = color.new(color.green, 80)
const color yellow80 = color.new(color.yellow, 80)

// Define a variable of type PivotType to track the pivot direction.
var PivotType lastPivot = PivotType.undefined

// Define pivots.
float pivotLowPrice = ta.pivotlow(lookback, lookback)
float pivotHighPrice = ta.pivothigh(lookback, lookback)
bool isPivotLow = not na(pivotLowPrice)
bool isPivotHigh = not na(pivotHighPrice)

// Plot triangles for pivot points.
plotshape(isPivotLow ? pivotLowPrice : na, "Low", shape.triangleup, location.belowbar, color.yellow, 
  offset = -lookback, size = size.tiny)
plotshape(isPivotHigh ? pivotHighPrice : na, "High", shape.triangledown, location.abovebar, color.yellow,
  offset = -lookback, size = size.tiny)

// Confirm highs and lows strictly in order. `PivotType.undefined` handles the case where no pivot has yet occurrred.
bool confirmedLow = isPivotLow and (lastPivot == PivotType.high or lastPivot == PivotType.undefined)
bool confirmedHigh = isPivotHigh and (lastPivot == PivotType.low or lastPivot == PivotType.undefined)

// Plot larger triangles for confirmed pivots.
plotshape(confirmedLow ? pivotLowPrice : na, "Low Confirmed", shape.triangleup, location.belowbar, color.green,
  offset = -lookback, size = size.normal)
plotshape(confirmedHigh ? pivotHighPrice : na, "High Confirmed", shape.triangledown, location.abovebar, color.red,
  offset = -lookback, size = size.normal)

// Update last pivot direction.
lastPivot := confirmedLow ? PivotType.low : confirmedHigh ? PivotType.high : lastPivot

// Color the background of the chart based on the direction of the most recent confirmed pivot.
bgcolor(lastPivot == PivotType.low ? green80 : lastPivot == PivotType.high ? red80 : 
  lastPivot == PivotType.undefined ? yellow80 : na)
```

**Note that:**

- The script uses an [enum](#enums) variable with three possible values to store the type of the last pivot and to decide whether to confirm subsequent pivots.
- A single boolean value cannot reliably do this, because boolean values [can only be `true` or `false` and not `na`](#boolean-values-cannot-be-na). Using a boolean value can cause unexpected behavior, for example, at the beginning of the chart history where no trigger condition has occurred.
- A pair of boolean variables can replicate this behavior, with careful handling. See the FAQ entry ["How can I accumulate a value for two exclusive states?"](#how-can-i-accumulate-a-value-for-two-exclusive-states) for an example of using two boolean values in this way.
- A string variable can also do the same thing. The advantage of an [enum](#enums) over a string is that all possible allowed values are known, thus avoiding the case where a condition tests for a value that is misspelled, outdated or otherwise not relevant. Such a test silently fails in every possible case, and the corresponding logic never runs. Such tests can therefore cause bugs that are difficult to find.

## [Can I merge two or more indicators into one?](https://www.tradingview.com#can-i-merge-two-or-more-indicators-into-one)

It is possible to combine indicators, paying attention to the following points:

- Ensure that the scales that the indicators use are compatible, or re-scale them to be compatible. For example, combining a moving average indicator, designed to overlay the bar chart, with a volume bar indicator that's meant for a separate indicator pane is unlikely to display as expected.
- Check that variable names do not overlap.
- Convert each script to the most recent version of Pine Script™, or at least the same version, before combining them.
- Ensure that there is only one version declaration and script declaration in the resulting script.

## [How can I rescale an indicator from one scale to another?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-rescale-an-indicator-from-one-scale-to-another)

Rescaling an indicator from one scale to another means trying to ensure that the values display within a similar range to other values, from the same indicator or from the chart.

For example, consider a script that displays volume typically measuring in the millions of units, and also RSI, which ranges from zero to one hundred. If the script displays these values in the same pane, the volume is visible but the RSI will be so small as to be unreadable.

Where values are dissimilar like this, they must be *rescaled* or *normalized*:

- If the minimum and maximum possible values are known, or *bounded*, the values can be *rescaled*, that is, adjusted to a new range bounded by different maximum and minimum values. Each value differs in absolute terms, but retains the same *relative* proportion to other rescaled values.
- If the values are *unbounded*, meaning that either the maximum or minimum values, or both, are not known, they must instead be *normalized*. Normalizing means scaling the values relative to historical maximum and minimum values. Because the maximum and minimum historical values can change over time as the script runs on more historical and realtime bars, the new scale is *dynamic* and therefore the new values are *not* exactly proportional to each other.

The example script below uses a `rescale()` function to rescale RSI values, and a `normalize()` function to normalize [Commodity Channel Index (CCI)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.cci) and [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) values. Although normalizing is an imperfect solution, it is more complete than using [ta.lowest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.lowest) and [ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest), because it uses the minimum and maximum values for the complete set of elapsed bars instead of a subset of fixed length.

## [How can I calculate my script's run time?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-calculate-my-scripts-run-time)

Programmers can measure the time that a script takes to run and see detailed information about which parts of the code take longest in the Pine Profiler. See the section of the User Manual on [Profiling and optimization](#profiling-and-optimization) for more information.

## [How can I save a value when an event occurs?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-save-a-value-when-an-event-occurs)

To save a value when an event occurs, use a *persistent variable*. Scripts declare persistent variables by using the [var](#var) keyword. Such variables are initialized only once, at [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) zero, instead of on each bar, and maintain the same value after that unless changed.

In the following example script, the [var](#var) keyword allows the `priceAtCross` variable to maintain its value between bars until a crossover event occurs, when the script updates the variable with the current close price. The [:=](#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator ensures that the global variable `priceAtCross` is modified. Using the [=](#-assignment-operator) assignment operator instead would create a new local variable that is inaccessible outside the [if](#if-structure) block. The new local variable would have the same name as the global variable, which is called *shadowing*. The compiler warns about shadow variables.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Save a value when an event occurs", "", true)
float hiHi = ta.highest(high, 5)[1]
var float priceAtCross = na
if ta.crossover(close, hiHi)  // When a crossover occurs, assign the current close price to `priceAtCross`.

## [How can I count touches of a specific level?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-count-touches-of-a-specific-level)

The most efficient way to count touches of a specific level is by tracking the series on each bar. A robust approach requires maintaining separate tallies for up and down bar touches and taking into account any gaps across the level. Using loops instead would be inefficient and impractical in this case.

The following example script records a value of 1 in a series whenever a touch occurs, and uses the [math.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sum) function to count these instances within the last `touchesLengthInput` bars. This script displays the median and touches on the chart using the `force_overlay` parameter of the `plot*()` functions, and displays the count in a separate pane.

## [How can I know if something is happening for the first time since the beginning of the day?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-know-if-something-is-happening-for-the-first-time-since-the-beginning-of-the-day)

One way is to use the [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) function to check if the number of bars since the last occurrence of a condition, plus one, is greater than the number of bars since the beginning of the new day.

Another method is to use a *persistent state* to decide whether an *event* can happen. When the timeframe changes to a new day, the state is reset to allow the event. If the condition occurs while the state allows it, an event triggers. When the event triggers, the state is set so so as not to allow the event.

The following example script shows both methods.

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-know-if-something-is-happening-for-the-first-time-since-the-beginning-of-the-day-1.CvNLhI4e_Z3pwv0.png)

bool previousUpCandleWasNotToday = barsSincePreviousUpCandle > barsSinceStartOfDay
bool isFirstToday1 = isUpCandle and previousUpCandleWasNotToday
plotchar(isFirstToday1, "isFirstToday1", "•", location.top, color = color.silver, size = size.normal)

plot(barsSinceStartOfDay, "barsSinceStartOfDay", display=display.data_window)

// ————— Method 2.
var bool hadUpCandleToday = false  // This is a persistent state.
bool     isFirstToday2    = false  // This is a one-off event.
if timeframe.change("1D")  // When the day begins..
    hadUpCandleToday := false  // we have not yet had an up candle today, so reset the state.
if isUpCandle and not hadUpCandleToday  // If this is the first up candle today..
    hadUpCandleToday := true  // set the persistent state
    isFirstToday2    := true  // and update the event.

## [How can I optimize Pine Script™ code?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-optimize-pine-script-code)

Optimizing Pine Script™ code can make scripts run faster and use less memory. For large or complex scripts, optimization can avoid scripts reaching the [computational limits](#limitations).

The [Pine Profiler](#profiling-and-optimization) analyzes all significant code in a script and displays how long each line or block takes to run. Before optimizing code, run the Pine Profiler to identify which parts of the code to optimize first. The Pine Profiler section of the User Guide contains an extensive discussion of [how to optimize code](#optimization). In addition, consider the following tips:

- Use strategy scripts only to model trades. Otherwise, use indicator scripts, which are faster.
- Become familiar with the Pine [execution model](#execution-model) and [time series](#time-series) to structure code effectively.
- Declare variables with the [var](#var) keyword when initialization involves time-consuming operations like complex functions, arrays, objects, or string manipulations.
- Keep operations on strings to a necessary minimum, because they can be more resource-intensive than operations on other types.
- Using built-in functions is usually faster than writing custom functions that do the same thing. Sometimes, alternative logic can be more efficient than using standard functions. For example, use a persistent variable when an event occurs, to avoid using [ta.valuewhen()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.valuewhen), as described in the FAQ entry [How can I save a value when an event occurs?](#how-can-i-save-a-value-when-an-event-occurs). Or save the [bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) when a condition occurs to avoid using [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince), as described in the FAQ entry [How to remember the last time a condition occurred?](#how-to-remember-the-last-time-a-condition-occurred).

## [How can I access a stock's financial information?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-access-a-stocks-financial-information)

In Pine, the [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial) function can directly request financial data.

On the chart, users can open financial indicators in the "Financials" section of the "Indicators, Metrics & Strategies" window.

## [How can I find the maximum value in a set of events?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-find-the-maximum-value-in-a-set-of-events)

Finding the maximum value of a variable that has a meaningful value *on every bar*, such as the [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) or [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) in price, is simple, using the [ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest) function.

However, if the values do not occur on every bar, we must instead store each value when it occurs and then find the maximum. The most flexible way to do this is by using an [array](#arrays).

The following example script stores pivot highs in a fixed-length array. The array is managed as a [queue](#using-an-array-as-a-queue): the script adds new pivots to the end, and removes the oldest element from the array. To identify the highest value among the stored pivots, we use the [array.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.max) function and plot this maximum value on the chart. Additionally, we place markers on the chart to indicate when the pivots are detected, and the bars where the pivots occurred. By definition, these points are not the same, because a pivot is only confirmed after a certain number of bars have elapsed.

```
//@version=6
indicator("Max pivot demo", "", true)
// Create inputs to specify the pivot legs and the number of last pivots to keep to compare.
int pivotLengthInput = input.int(5, "Pivot length", minval = 1)
int numPivotsInput   = input.int(3, "Number of pivots to check")
// Initialize an array with a size based on the number of recent pivots to evaluate.
var array<float> pivotsArray = array.new<float>(numPivotsInput)
// Find the pivot value and set up a condition to verify if a value has been found.
float ph = ta.pivothigh(pivotLengthInput, pivotLengthInput)
bool newPH = not na(ph)
// When a new pivot is found, add it to the array and discard the oldest value.
if newPH
    pivotsArray.push(ph)
    pivotsArray.shift()
// Display the max value from the array on the chart, along with markers indicating the positions and detection times of the pivot highs.
plot(pivotsArray.max())
plotchar(newPH, "newPH", "•", location.abovebar, offset = - pivotLengthInput)
plotchar(newPH, "newPH", "▲", location.top)
```

## [How can I display plot values in the chart's scale?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-display-plot-values-in-the-charts-scale)

To display the names and values of plots from an indicator in the chart's scale, right-click on the chart to open the chart "Settings" menu. In the "Scales and lines" tab, select "Name" and "Value" from the "Indicators and financials" drop-down menu.

## [How can I reset a sum on a condition?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-reset-a-sum-on-a-condition)

To sum a series of values, initialize a persistent variable by using the [var](#var) keyword to the track the sum. Then use a logical test to reset the values when a condition occurs.

In the following example script, we initialize a persistent variable called `cumulativeVolume`  to track the sum of the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume). Then we reset it to zero on a Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) cross up or down.

We plot the cumulative [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) on the chart, as well as arrows to show the MACD crosses.

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-i-reset-a-sum-on-a-condition-1.-sS8zw0l_miQ2Y.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Reset sum on condition example", overlay = false)
const color TEAL = color.new(color.teal, 50)
const color RED  = color.new(color.red,  50)
[macdLine, signalLine, _] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
bool crossUp = ta.crossover(macdLine,  signalLine)
bool crossDn = ta.crossunder(macdLine, signalLine)
bool doReset = crossUp or crossDn
var float cumulativeVolume = na
cumulativeVolume += volume  // On every bar, we sum the volume.
cumulativeVolume := doReset ? 0. : cumulativeVolume  // But when we get a cross, we reset it to zero.
plot(cumulativeVolume, "Cumulative volume", close >= open ? TEAL : RED, 1, plot.style_columns)
plotshape(crossUp, "crossDn", shape.arrowup,   location.top, color.lime)
plotshape(crossDn, "crossUp", shape.arrowdown, location.top, color.fuchsia)
```

Note that:

- In the [ta.macd()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.macd) function call, we only require two of the three values returned in the [tuple](#tuples). To avoid unnecessary variable declarations, we assign the third tuple value to an underscore. Here, [the underscore acts like a dummy variable](#using-an-underscore-_-as-an-identifier).

## [How can I accumulate a value for two exclusive states?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-accumulate-a-value-for-two-exclusive-states)

Consider a simple indicator defined by two exclusive states: *buy* and *sell*. The indicator cannot be in both *buy* and *sell* states simultaneously. In the *buy* state, the script accumulates the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) of shares being traded. In the *sell* state, the accumulation of volume begins again from zero.

There are different ways to code this kind of logic. See the FAQ entry ["How can I alternate conditions"](#how-can-i-alternate-conditions) for an example of using an [enum](#enums) to manage two exclusive states. The following example script uses two boolean variables to do the same thing.

Additionally, this script demonstrates the concept of *events* and *states*. An event is a condition that occurs on one or more arbitrary bars. A state is a condition that persists over time. Typically, programmers use events to turn states on and off. In turn, states can allow or prevent other processing.

The script plots arrows for events, which are based on rising or falling values of the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) price. These events determine which of the two exclusive states is active; the script colors the background according to the current state. The script accumulates bullish and bearish volume only in the corresponding bullish or bearish state, displaying it in a Weis Wave fashion.

![image](images/Techniques-How-can-i-accumulate-a-value-for-two-exclusive-states-1.6ND5oJEJ_Z1ataMH.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Cumulative volume", "")

bool upEvent = ta.rising(close,  2)
bool dnEvent = ta.falling(close, 2)

var bool upState = false, var bool dnState = false
// When the right event occurs, turn the state on; when a counter-event occurs, turn it off; otherwise, persist it.
upState := upEvent ? true : dnEvent ? false : upState
dnState := upEvent ? false : dnEvent ? true : dnState

var float volUp = na, var float volDn = na

if upState  // For every bar that we are in the up state,
    volUp += volume  // sum the up volume.
if dnState
    volDn += volume

if upEvent  // If we change state to up,
    volDn := 0  // reset the down volume.
if dnEvent   
    volUp := 0

plot(+volUp, "Up Volume", color.green,  4, plot.style_columns)
plot(-volDn, "Dn Volume", color.maroon, 4, plot.style_columns)
plotchar(upEvent, "Up Event", "▲", location.bottom, color.green,  size = size.tiny)
plotchar(dnEvent, "Dn Event", "▼", location.top,    color.maroon, size = size.tiny)
bgcolor(upState ? color.new(color.green, 90) : dnState ? color.new(color.red, 90) : na)
```

Note that:

- Equivalent logic using ternary conditions is smaller and potentially more efficient, but not as easy to read, extend, or debug. This more verbose logic illustrates the concepts of events and states, which can apply to many types of scripting problems. This logic is an extension of the on-off switch in the FAQ entry ["How can I implement an on/off switch?"](#how-can-i-implement-an-onoff-switch).
- When using states, it is important to make the conditions for resetting states explicit, to avoid unforeseen problems.
- Displaying all events and states during script development, either on the chart or in the Data Window, helps debugging.

## [How can I organize my script's inputs in the Settings/Inputs tab?](https://www.tradingview.com#how-can-i-organize-my-scripts-inputs-in-the-settingsinputs-tab)

A script's plots and inputs constitute its user interface. The following example script uses the following techniques to organize inputs for greater clarity:

- **Grouping inputs:** Create a section header for a group of inputs by using the `group` parameter in the [input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input) functions. Use constants for group names to simplify any potential name changes.
- **Visual boundaries:** Use ASCII characters to create separators, establishing visual boundaries for distinct group sections. For continuous separator lines, reference group headers 1 and 2 in our script below, which use ASCII characters 205 or 196. Conversely, the dash (ASCII 45) and Em dash (ASCII 151), shown in group headers 3 and 4, do not join continuously, resulting in a less visually appealing distinction. Note that Unicode characters might display differently across different machines and browsers, potentially altering their appearance or spacing for various users.
- **Indentation of sub-sections:** For a hierarchical representation, use Unicode whitespace characters to indent input sub-sections. Group 3 in our script uses the Em space ( ) 8195 (0x2003) to give a tab-like spacing.
- **Vertical alignment of inlined inputs:** In our script, Group 1 shows how vertical alignment is difficult when inline inputs have varied `title` lengths. To counteract this misalignment, Group 2 uses the Unicode EN space ( ): 8194 (0x2002) for padding, since regular spaces are stripped from the label. For precise alignment, use different quantities and types of Unicode spaces. See [here](https://jkorpela.fi/chars/spaces.html) for a list of Unicode spaces of different widths. Note that, much like the separator characters, the rendering of these spaces might differ across browsers and machines.
- **Placing inputs on one line:** Add multiple related inputs into a single line using the `inline` parameter. Group 4 in our script adds the title argument to just the first input and skips it for the others.

```

Tips:

- Order the inputs to prioritize user convenience rather than to reflect the order used in the script's calculations.
- Never use two checkboxes for mutually exclusive selections. Use dropdown menus instead.
- Remember that dropdown menus can accommodate long strings.
- Provide adequate minimum and maximum values for numeric values, selecting the proper [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float) or [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int) type.
- Customize step values based on the specific needs of each input.
- Because checkboxes cannot be indented, use the [input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input) function's `options` parameter to create dropdown selections so that the sections appear more organized compared to using checkboxes.
- Observe how the `level3Input` is calculated as a boolean variable by comparing the input with the `EQ1` "ON" constant. This method provides a visually appealing indented on-off switch in the menu without adding complexity to the code.
- For a consistent visual appearance, vertically center the separator titles across all inputs. Due to the proportional spacing of the font, achieving this might require some trial and error.
- To ensure that separators align just slightly to the left of the furthest edge of dropdowns, begin with the longest input title, because it sets the width of the window.
- To avoid adjusting separators if the longest input title is shorter than initially anticipated, extend its length using Unicode white space. Refer to the code example for input `level4Input` for a demonstration.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/Error messages

# [Error messages](https://www.tradingview.com#error-messages)

## [The if statement is too long](https://www.tradingview.com#the-if-statement-is-too-long)

This error occurs when the indented code inside an [if
statement](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
is too large for the compiler. Because of how the compiler works, you
won't receive a message telling you exactly how many lines of code you
are over the limit. The only solution now is to break up your [if
statement](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)
into smaller parts (functions or smaller [if
statements](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)).
The example below shows a reasonably lengthy [if
statement](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if);
theoretically, this would throw `line 4: if statement is too long`:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My script")

var e = 0
if barstate.islast
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3
    d = 4
    e := a + b + c + d

plot(e)
```

To fix this code, you could move these lines into their own function:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My script")

var e = 0
doSomeWork() =>
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3
    d = 4

    result = a + b + c + d

if barstate.islast
    e := doSomeWork()

plot(e)
```

## [Script requesting too many securities](https://www.tradingview.com#script-requesting-too-many-securities)

The maximum number of securities in script is limited to 40. If you
declare a variable as a `request.security` function call and then use
that variable as input for other variables and calculations, it will not
result in multiple `request.security` calls. But if you will declare a
function that calls `request.security` --- every call to this function
will count as a `request.security` call.

It is not easy to say how many securities will be called looking at the
source code. Following example have exactly 3 calls to
`request.security` after compilation:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Securities count")
a = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, '42', close)  // (1) first unique security call
b = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, '42', close)  // same call as above, will not produce new security call after optimizations

plot(a)
plot(a + 2)
plot(b)

sym(p) =>  // no security call on this line
    request.security(syminfo.tickerid, p, close)
plot(sym('D'))  // (2) one indirect call to security
plot(sym('W'))  // (3) another indirect call to security

c = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe.period, open)  // result of this line is never used, and will be optimized out
```

## [Script could not be translated from: null](https://www.tradingview.com#script-could-not-be-translated-from-null)

```
study($)
```

Usually this error occurs in version 1 Pine scripts, and means that code
is incorrect. Pine Script™ of version 2 (and higher) is better at
explaining errors of this kind. So you can try to switch to version 2 by
adding a
[special attribute](#version) in the first line. You'll get
`line 2: no viable alternative at character '$'`:

```
// @version=2
study($)
```

## [line 2: no viable alternative at character '$'](https://www.tradingview.com#line-2-no-viable-alternative-at-character-)

This error message gives a hint on what is wrong. `$` stands in place of
string with script title. For example:

```
// @version=2
study("title")
```

## [Mismatched input <…> expecting <???>](https://www.tradingview.com#mismatched-input--expecting-)

Same as `no viable alternative`, but it is known what should be at that
place. Example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
    plot(1)
```

```
line 3: mismatched input 'plot' expecting 'end of line without line continuation'
```

To fix this you should start line with `plot` on a new line without an
indent:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
plot(1)
```

## [Loop is too long (> 500 ms)](https://www.tradingview.com#loop-is-too-long--500-ms)

We limit the computation time of loop on every historical bar and
realtime tick to protect our servers from infinite or very long loops.
This limit also fail-fast indicators that will take too long to compute.
For example, if you'll have 5000 bars, and indicator takes 500
milliseconds to compute on each of bars, it would have result in more
than 16 minutes of loading:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Loop is too long", max_bars_back = 101)
s = 0
for i = 1 to 1e3  // to make it longer
    for j = 0 to 100
        if timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 00, 00) <= time[j] and time[j] < timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 23, 59)
            s := s + 1
plot(s)
```

It might be possible to optimize algorithm to overcome this error. In
this case, algorithm may be optimized like this:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Loop is too long", max_bars_back = 101)
bar_back_at(t) =>
    i = 0
    step = 51
    for j = 1 to 100
        if i < 0
            i := 0
            break
        if step == 0
            break
        if time[i] >= t
            i := i + step
            i
        else
            i := i - step
            i
        step := step / 2
        step
    i

s = 0
for i = 1 to 1e3  // to make it longer
    s := s - bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 23, 59)) +
         bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 00, 00))
    s
plot(s)
```

## [Script has too many local variables](https://www.tradingview.com#script-has-too-many-local-variables)

This error appears if the script is too large to be compiled. A
statement `var=expression` creates a local variable for `var`. Apart
from this, it is important to note, that auxiliary variables can be
implicitly created during the process of a script compilation. The limit
applies to variables created both explicitly and implicitly. The
limitation of 1000 variables is applied to each function individually.
In fact, the code placed in a *global* scope of a script also implicitly
wrapped up into the main function and the limit of 1000 variables
becomes applicable to it. There are few refactorings you can try to
avoid this issue:

```
var1 = expr1
var2 = expr2
var3 = var1 + var2
```

can be converted into:

```
var3 = expr1 + expr2
```

## [Pine Script™ cannot determine the referencing length of a series. Try using max_bars_back in the indicator or strategy function](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-script-cannot-determine-the-referencing-length-of-a-series-try-using-max_bars_back-in-the-indicator-or-strategy-function)

The error appears in cases where Pine Script™ wrongly autodetects the
required maximum length of series used in a script. This happens when a
script's flow of execution does not allow Pine Script™ to inspect the
use of series in branches of conditional statements (`if`, `iff` or
`?`), and Pine Script™ cannot automatically detect how far back the
series is referenced. Here is an example of a script causing this
problem:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requires max_bars_back")
test = 0.0
if bar_index > 1000
    test := ta.roc(close, 20)
plot(test)
```

In order to help Pine Script™ with detection, you should add the
`max_bars_back` parameter to the script's `indicator` or `strategy`
function:

```
//@version=6
indicator("Requires max_bars_back", max_bars_back = 20)
test = 0.0
if bar_index > 1000
    test := ta.roc(close, 20)
plot(test)
```

You may also resolve the issue by taking the problematic expression out
of the conditional branch, in which case the `max_bars_back` parameter
is not required:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
test = 0.0
roc20 = ta.roc(close, 20)
if bar_index > 1000
    test := roc20
plot(test)
```

In cases where the problem is caused by a **variable** rather than a
built-in **function** (`vwma` in our example), you may use the
`max_bars_back` function to explicitly define the referencing length for
that variable only. This has the advantage of requiring less runtime
resources, but entails that you identify the problematic variable, e.g.,
variable `s` in the following example:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
f(off) =>
    t = 0.0
    s = close
    if bar_index > 242
        t := s[off]
    t
plot(f(301))
```

This situation can be resolved using the `max_bars_back`**function** to
define the referencing length of variable `s` only, rather than for all
the script's variables:

```
//@version=6
indicator("My Script")
f(off) =>
    t = 0.0
    s = close
    max_bars_back(s, 301)
    if bar_index > 242
        t := s[off]
    t
plot(f(301))
```

When using drawings that refer to previous bars through `bar_index[n]`
and `xloc = xloc.bar_index`, the time series received from this bar will
be used to position the drawings on the time axis. Therefore, if it is
impossible to determine the correct size of the buffer, this error may
occur. To avoid this, you need to use `max_bars_back(time, n)`. This
behavior is described in more detail in the section about
[drawings](#historical-buffer-and-max_bars_back).

## [Memory limits exceeded. The study allocates X times more than allowed](https://www.tradingview.com#memory-limits-exceeded-the-study-allocates-x-times-more-than-allowed)

The most common cause for this error is returning [objects](#objects) and [collections](#collections) from [request.*()](#other-timeframes-and-data) functions. Other possible causes include unnecessary drawing updates, excess historical buffer capacity, or inefficient use of [max_bars_back](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back).

### [**Returning collections from `request.*()` functions**](https://www.tradingview.com#returning-collections-from-request-functions)

A common source of the "*Memory limits exceeded*" error is returning [objects](#objects) or [collections](#collections) from another chart symbol or timeframe using [request.*()](#other-timeframes-and-data) functions.

When requesting data from other contexts, the data for *each bar* is copied and stored in memory to allow the script to reference it later in the main context. This can use a lot of memory, depending on the data. Requesting large collections can easily lead to excessive memory consumption.

Let's look at an example script where we [request](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) data to calculate the [balance of power (BOP)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000589100-balance-of-power-bop/) for the symbol at a higher timeframe. Here, the *request expression* is a [custom function](#user-defined-functions) that populates a [persistent array](#using-var-and-varip-keywords) with our calculated BOP values, returning the *full array* to the main context on *each* bar. We intend to use these stored array values to calculate and plot the [average](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg) BOP in the main context. However, returning every array instance consumes a lot of memory, and so this script can throw a memory error on charts with a sufficiently long history:

```
//@version=6
indicator("BOP array in higher timeframe context", "Memory limit demo")

//@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. 
int avgLength = input.int(5, "Average BOP Length", minval = 1)

//Returns a copy of the `dataArray` on every bar, which uses a lot of memory.
dataFunction() => 
    //@variable Persistent array containing the "balance of power" (BOP) values for all bars from the higher timeframe.
    var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0)

    //@variable The "balance of power" percentage calculated for the current bar.
    float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100
    dataArray.push(bop)

    //Return the full collection.
    dataArray

// Request the full BOP array from the 1D timeframe.
array<float> reqData = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", dataFunction())

// Plot zero line.
hline(0, "Zero line", color.gray, hline.style_dotted)

// Latest BOP value and average BOP are calculated in the main context if `reqData` is not `na`.
//@variable The latest BOP value from the `reqData` array.
float latestValue = na
//@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values.
float avgBOP = na

if not na(reqData)
    // Retrieve BOP value for the current main context bar.
    latestValue := reqData.last()

    // Calculate the average BOP for the most-recent values from the higher timeframe array.
    //@variable Size of the `reqData` array returned from the higher timeframe.
    int dataSize = reqData.size()
    //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `reqData` array. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set.
    array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? reqData.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): reqData
    avgBOP := lastValues.avg()

// Plot the BOP value and average line.
color plotColor = latestValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange
plot(latestValue, "BOP", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)
plot(avgBOP, "Avg", color.purple, linewidth = 3)
```

### [**How do I fix this?**](https://www.tradingview.com#how-do-i-fix-this)

Optimize requests and limit the data returned to the main context to ensure that only the *minimum necessary* data is stored in memory.

If possible, try to return *calculated results* directly rather than returning the collections themselves, or only return collections *conditionally*, when they are necessary in the main context.

Let's consider a few common scenarios where scripts need specific data in the main context.

#### [**Return last state only**](https://www.tradingview.com#return-last-state-only)

If a script needs only the *last state* of a requested collection in the main context: use an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast) condition to return a copy of the *last bar's collection* only.

Here, we modified our script to display only the *latest* average BOP (a single value), rather than plotting an average line. The updated request function now returns the calculated BOP values directly for each bar, and returns the higher timeframe's array only on the last bar:

![image](images/Errors-Return-last-state-only.B7DlHDxT_1Srw3K.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("BOP array on last bar", "Memory limit demo")

//@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. 
int avgLength = input.int(5, "Average BOP Length", minval = 1)

// Returns the calculated `bop` each bar, and a copy of the `dataArray` on the last bar or `na` otherwise.
dataFunction() => 
    //@variable Persistent array containing the "balance of power" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars.
    var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0)

    //@variable The "balance of power" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar.
    float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100
    dataArray.push(bop)

    // Return the collection on the last bar only.
    if barstate.islast
        [bop, dataArray]
    else 
        [bop, na]

// Request calculated BOP value, and BOPs array if on last bar, from the higher timeframe.
[reqValue, reqData] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", dataFunction())

// Plot zero line.
hline(0, "Zero line", color.gray, hline.style_dotted)

// Plot the BOP value for each main context bar.
color plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange
plot(reqValue, "BOP", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)

// Calculate the average BOP for most-recent values from the higher timeframe array, and display result in a table cell.
if not na(reqData)
    //@variable Size of the `reqData` array returned from the higher timeframe.
    int dataSize = reqData.size()
    //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `reqData` array. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set.
    array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? reqData.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): reqData
    //@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values.
    float avgBOP = lastValues.avg()

    // Display latest average value in a single-cell table.
    var table displayTable = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.purple)
    displayTable.cell(0, 0, "Avg of last " + str.tostring(avgLength) + " BOPs: " + str.tostring(avgBOP, "##.##") + "%", 
         text_color = color.white)
```

#### [**Return calculated results**](https://www.tradingview.com#return-calculated-results)

If a script needs the *result* of a calculation on a collection, but does not need the collection itself in the main context, use a [user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) as the request expression. The function can calculate on the collection in the *requested* context and return only the result to the main context.

For example, we can calculate the average BOP directly within our request function. Therefore, only the calculated values are stored in memory, and the request expression returns a tuple (current BOP and average BOP) to plot the results in the main context:

![image](images/Errors-Return-calculated-results.Do61vtAy_Z1MO38Y.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Return BOP results only", "Memory limit demo")

//@variable User-input length for calculating average of BOP values. 
int avgLength = input.int(5, "Average BOP Length", minval = 1)

// Returns the calculated `bop` and `avgBOP` values directly.
dataFunction() => 
    //@variable Persistent array containing the "balance of power" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars.
    var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0)

    //@variable The "balance of power" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar.
    float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100
    dataArray.push(bop)

    // Calculate the average BOP for the `avgLength` most-recent values.
    //@variable Size of the `dataArray`.
    int dataSize = dataArray.size()
    //@variable A subset of the latest values from the `dataArray`. Its size is determined by the `avgLength` set.
    array<float> lastValues = dataSize >= avgLength ? dataArray.slice(dataSize - avgLength, dataSize): dataArray
    //@variable The average of the last `avgLength` BOP values.
    float avgBOP = lastValues.avg()

    //Return the calculated results.
    [bop, avgBOP]

// Request BOP and average BOP values from the higher timeframe.
[reqValue, reqAverage] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", dataFunction())

// Plot zero line.
hline(0, "Zero line", color.gray, hline.style_dotted)

// Plot the BOP value and average line.
color plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange
plot(reqValue, "BOP", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)
plot(reqAverage, "Avg", color.purple, linewidth = 3)
```

#### [**Return the collection on some bars**](https://www.tradingview.com#return-the-collection-on-some-bars)

If a script needs the *collection itself* in the main context, but *not for**every bar*, use [conditional expressions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) to return only the necessary collections to the main context, returning [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) otherwise. The logic in the main context can then address the [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) gaps in the series and perform its desired actions on the reduced collections.

For example, if we want to calculate the average BOP across each *month* instead of using a user-input length, we can return the array from the requested context only when there is a change to a new month, returning [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) otherwise. We then maintain the previous month's values in the main context to keep a valid array for all intra-month bars:

![image](images/Errors-Return-the-collection-on-some-bars.CQvTHovc_iqEih.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Monthly BOP array", "Memory limit demo")

// Returns the calculated `bop`, and a copy of the `dataArray` on a month's first trading day only, or `na` otherwise.
dataFunction() => 
    //@variable Persistent array containing the "balance of power" (BOP) values for all higher timeframe bars.
    var array<float> dataArray = array.new_float(0)

    // When a new month starts, return monthly data array to calculate average BOP for completed month.
    //@variable Array is `na` except on first trading day of each month, when it contains completed month's BOP values. 
    array<float> returnArray = na
    //@variable Is `true` on the first bar of each month, `false` otherwise.
    bool isNewMonth = timeframe.change("1M")
    if isNewMonth
        returnArray := dataArray
    //Clear persistent array to start storing new month's data.
    if isNewMonth[1]
        dataArray.clear()

    //@variable The "balance of power" percentage calculated for the current higher timeframe bar.
    float bop = (close - open) / (high - low) * 100
    dataArray.push(bop)

    //Return the calculated result and the `returnArray`.
    [bop, returnArray]

// Request BOP data from the higher timeframe. (Returns calculated BOP and array of BOP values if new month starts)
[reqValue, reqData] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", dataFunction())

// Calculate the average BOP for the most-recent completed month.
//@variable Persistent array that holds the BOP values for the most-recent completed month.
var array<float> completedMonthBOPs = array.new_float(0)
// If new month starts (i.e., `reqData` is not returned as `na`), then `completedMonthBOPs` is updated with new values.
// Otherwise, it persists the last valid values for the rest of the month to adjust for `na` gaps.
completedMonthBOPs := na(reqData) ? completedMonthBOPs : reqData
//@variable The average BOP for the most-recent completed month.
float avgBOP = completedMonthBOPs.avg()

// Plot the BOP value and average line.
color plotColor = reqValue >= 0 ? color.aqua : color.orange
plot(reqValue, "BOP", plotColor, style = plot.style_columns)
plot(avgBOP, "Avg", color.purple, linewidth = 3)
```

### [**Other possible error sources and their fixes**](https://www.tradingview.com#other-possible-error-sources-and-their-fixes)

There are a few other ways to optimize scripts to consume less memory.

#### [**Minimize `request.*()` calls**](https://www.tradingview.com#minimize-request-calls)

The [request.*()](#other-timeframes-and-data) function calls can be computationally expensive, because they retrieve data from other contexts, which can often require significant resource usage. Excessive or inefficient requests can easily cause scripts to reach the memory limit.

This memory consumption is especially substantial for scripts requesting data from [*lower timeframes*](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security_lower_tf), where the request function returns an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) of multiple lower timeframe bars for *each* main context bar. For example, requesting "1" data on a "1D" chart returns hundreds of "1" bars for each "1D" bar that executes the request. In the process, the script must allocate memory to store all the requested data arrays so that it can access them later in the main context, which quickly increases the memory consumption.

Programmers can reduce the number of requested expressions by:

- Removing unnecessary `request.*()` function calls.
- Changing the requested timeframe to a higher resolution.
- Condensing multiple requests to the *same* context into a single `request.*()` call.
- Adjusting the `request.*()` function's [calc_bars_count](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) parameter to restrict the historical data points in the requested context.

See [this section](#minimizing-request-calls) in the User Manual for more information on optimizing `request.*()` calls.

#### [**Refrain from using `max_bars_back` unless necessary**](https://www.tradingview.com#refrain-from-using-max_bars_back-unless-necessary)

The `max_bars_back` parameter of an [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) or [strategy](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) sets the size of the *history buffer* for all series variables in a script. The history buffer determines the number of historical references *stored in memory* for the script's built-in and user-defined variables.

By default, the Pine Script™ runtime automatically allocates an appropriate buffer for each variable. Therefore, the `max_bars_back` parameter and [function](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back) are only necessary when Pine [cannot determine the referencing length of a series](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000587849-i-see-pine-cannot-determine-the-referencing-length-of-a-series-try-using-max-bars-back-error/).

If you encounter this referencing length error, ensure that you set the `max_bars_back` value appropriately to your script's needs. Setting a value that's too large can lead to excessive memory consumption, as it stores unnecessary historical data that the script ultimately doesn't use. Read up on how to optimize using `max_bars_back`[in our Help Center](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?solution=43000587849).

#### [**Minimize historical buffer calculations**](https://www.tradingview.com#minimize-historical-buffer-calculations)

The Pine Script™ runtime automatically creates historical buffers for all variables and function calls in a script. It determines the size of a buffer based on the *historical references* needed in the code (the references made using the [[]](#--history-referencing-operator) history-referencing operator).

As the script runs across the dataset, referencing distant points in bar history can cause the script to restart its execution on previous bars to adjust its historical buffer size (see this [User Manual article](#minimizing-historical-buffer-calculations) to learn more). Larger buffers in turn lead to an increase in memory consumption and can result in a runtime error. Ensure that scripts are referencing *necessary* historical values only, and avoid referencing very distant points in history when possible.

You can use the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) function's `calc_bars_count` parameter or the [max_bars_back()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_max_bars_back) function to *manually restrict* the historical data capacity on a script-wide or variable-specific scale. However, be aware that these methods can also cause memory consumption issues of their own if used improperly.

#### [**Reduce drawing updates for tables**](https://www.tradingview.com#reduce-drawing-updates-for-tables)

[Tables](#tables) only display their *last state* on a chart. Any updates to a table on historical bars are redundant, because they are not visible. To use the least memory, draw the table *once*, and fill it on the last bar.

Use the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_var) keyword to declare table objects once. Enclose all other setter function calls in a conditional [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)[barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast) block for better performance. For more about tables, see this [User Manual article](#tables).

#### [**Do not update drawings on historical bars**](https://www.tradingview.com#do-not-update-drawings-on-historical-bars)

Similar to tables, any updates to drawing objects such as [lines](#lines) and [labels](#labels) that are made on historical bars are never seen by the user. The user only sees updates on *realtime* bars.

Eliminate updates to historical drawings during historical bars wherever possible. For more information, see [this User Manual section](#reducing-drawing-updates).

#### [**Minimize total drawings stored for a chart**](https://www.tradingview.com#minimize-total-drawings-stored-for-a-chart)

[Drawing objects](#drawing-types) such as [lines](#lines) and [labels](#labels) can consume a lot of memory, especially if a script *recreates* drawings unnecessarily.

For example, if a script draws a line from point `x1` to `x2`, then needs to update the line's endpoint (`x2`), it's more computationally expensive to delete the existing line and redraw a new line from `x1` to `x3`. Instead, using the *setter* function [line.set_x2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_x2) to update the existing line's endpoint is more efficient.

Look for ways to optimize drawing objects in a script:

- Reduce the number of redrawn objects by initializing drawing object *identifiers* and using their setter functions to modify properties.
- Remove unnecessary chart drawings using the `delete()` functions (e.g., [line.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.delete) and [label.delete()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.delete)).
- Reduce an indicator's maximum drawings limit using the `max_lines_count` or `max_labels_count`[parameters](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator).

#### [**Filter dates in strategies**](https://www.tradingview.com#filter-dates-in-strategies)

The total number of trades or orders in a [strategy](#strategies) can impact the memory consumption of a script. For large datasets, reduce the number of unnecessary historical orders stored in memory by limiting the *starting point* of your strategy.

You can filter the strategy's date by adding a [conditional expression](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) that compares the bar time to a specified timestamp to only place entry/exit orders beyond a certain date.

See an example of date filtering in strategies [here](https://www.pinecoders.com/faq_and_code/#how-do-i-implement-date-range-filtering-in-strategies).

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/Release notes

# [Release notes](https://www.tradingview.com#release-notes)

This page contains release notes describing notable changes to the Pine Script™ experience.

## [2025](https://www.tradingview.com#2025)

### [March 2025](https://www.tradingview.com#march-2025)

The [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop structure has updated boundary-checking behavior. Previously, any [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) statement established the loop counter's end boundary (`to_num`) *before* starting the first iteration, and the final possible counter value *could not change* during the loop's execution. Changing the result of an expression used as a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop's `to_num` argument inside the local scope *did not* affect the loop's iteration range.

Now, a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop evaluates the `to_num` boundary *dynamically*, before *every iteration*. With this update, the loop statement can modify its stopping condition after any change to the `to_num` argument's result across iterations.

To learn more about this new behavior, refer to the [`for` loops](#for-loops) section of the [Loops](#loops) page and the [Dynamic `for` loop boundaries](#dynamic-for-loop-boundaries) section of the [v6 migration guide](#to-pine-version-6).

### [February 2025](https://www.tradingview.com#february-2025)

We've removed the scope count limit. Previously, any script's total number of scopes, including the global scope and all local scopes from [user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions) and [methods](#user-defined-methods), [loops](#loops), [conditional structures](#conditional-structures), [user-defined types](#user-defined-types), and [enums](#enums), was limited to 550. Now, scripts can contain an indefinite number of local scopes from these structures.

We've introduced two new built-in variables, `bid` and `ask`, providing access to real-time market prices:

- [bid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bid) - represents the highest price an active buyer is willing to pay for the instrument at its current value.
- [ask](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ask) - represents the lowest price an active seller will accept for the instrument at its current value.

These variables are only available on the `"1T"` timeframe. On other timeframes, their values are `na`.

## [2024](https://www.tradingview.com#2024)

### [December 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#december-2024)

The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function has updated calculation behaviors. Previously, calls to this command with arguments for the absolute and relative parameters defining a price level for the same exit order always prioritized the *absolute* parameter and *ignored* the relative one. For example, a call with specified `limit` and `profit` values always ignored the `profit` value. Now, the command evaluates *both* related parameters and uses the level that the market price is expected to *activate first*. See [this section](#strategyexit-evaluates-parameter-pairs) of the [v6 migration guide](#to-pine-version-6) for more information.

### [November 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#november-2024)

#### [Introducing Pine Script™ v6](https://www.tradingview.com#introducing-pine-script-v6)

Pine Script™ has graduated to v6! Starting today, future Pine updates will apply exclusively to this version. Therefore, we recommend converting existing v5 scripts to access new features as we roll them out. See our [migration guide](#to-pine-version-6) to understand the changes to existing Pine behaviors and learn how to convert scripts to v6.

Several new features and behaviors come with this version's release:

- Scripts can now call `request.*()` functions with *"series string"* arguments for the parameters that define the requested context, meaning a single `request.*()` call can change its requested data feed on *any* historical bar. Additionally, it is now possible to call `request.*()` functions inside the local scopes of [loops](#loops), [conditional structures](#conditional-structures), and exported [library](#libraries) functions. See the [Dynamic requests](#dynamic-requests) section of the [Other timeframes and data](https://www.tradingview.com/concepts/other-timeframes-and-data/) page to learn more.
- Values of the "bool" type are now strictly `true` or `false`. They are never [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) in v6. Additionally, the [or](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_or) and [and](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_and) operators now feature *short-circuit ("lazy")* evaluation. If the first expression of an [or](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_or) operation is `true`, or the first expression of an [and](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_and) operation is `false`, the script does **not** evaluate the second expression because it is not necessary to determine the result. These improvements help boost the runtime efficiency of scripts that rely on "bool" values and conditional expressions.
- The `size` property of [labels](#labels) and the `text_size` property of [boxes](#boxes) and [tables](#tables) now support "int" values in addition to the `size.*` constants. These "int" values represent sizes in *typographic points*, offering a more granular and wide range of text size possibilities.
- The new `text_formatting` parameter of the [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new), [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.new), and [table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_table.cell) functions determines whether the object's displayed text is **bold**, *italicized*, or ***both***. It accepts one of these three new `text.*` constants: [text.format_bold](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_bold), [text.format_italic](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_italic), [text.format_none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#const_text.format_none). To modify a drawing object's `text_formatting` property, use the corresponding `*set_text_formatting()` functions.
- [Strategies](#strategies) no longer stop calculating and raise an error when they reach the 9000 trade limit while not using Deep Backtesting mode. Instead, they *trim* the oldest orders to make space for new ones. The trimmed orders are *not* visible in the [Strategy Tester](#strategy-tester), but that does not change the strategy's simulation. To retrieve the trade index of the earliest *non-trimmed* order, use the [strategy.closedtrades.first_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.closedtrades.first_index) variable.
- The [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get), [array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set), [array.insert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.insert), and [array.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.remove) functions now support *negative*`index` arguments to reference elements starting from the *end* of an [array](#arrays). For instance, the call `array.get(myArray, -2)` retrieves the second to last element in `myArray`, which is equivalent to `array.get(myArray, array.size(myArray) - 2)`.
- The new [syminfo.mincontract](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.mincontract) variable holds a value representing the smallest number of contracts/shares/lots/units required to trade the current symbol, as set by the exchange.
- Two new variables, [syminfo.main_tickerid](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_syminfo.main_tickerid) and [timeframe.main_period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.main_period), reference the ticker ID and timeframe from the script's *main context*, even if the script uses them in the `expression` argument of a `request.*()` call. Here, "main context" refers to the current chart's symbol and timeframe, unless the script is an [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) that includes `symbol` or `timeframe` arguments in its declaration statement.

### [October 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#october-2024)

We've added an optional `behind_chart` parameter to the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator) and [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy) functions. This parameter specifies where plots and drawings appear relative to the main chart display when the `overlay` parameter is `true`. If `behind_chart` is `true`, the script's visuals appear behind the chart display. If `false`, they appear in front of the chart display. The default is `true`.

### [August 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#august-2024)

The [ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ticker.new) and [ticker.modify()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ticker.modify) functions feature two new parameters: `settlement_as_close` and `backadjustment`. Users can specify whether these parameters are on, off, or set to inherit the symbol's default settings. These settings only affect the data from futures symbols with these options available on their charts. They have no effect on other symbols.

- The `backadjustment` parameter specifies whether past contract data on continuous futures symbols is back-adjusted. Its possible values are: [backadjustment.on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_backadjustment.on), [backadjustment.off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_backadjustment.off), or [backadjustment.inherit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_backadjustment.inherit).
- The `settlement_as_close` parameter specifies whether a futures symbol's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close) value represents the actual closing price or the settlement price on "1D" and higher timeframes. Its possible values are: [settlement_as_close.on](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_settlement_as_close.on), [settlement_as_close.off](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_settlement_as_close.off), or [settlement_as_close.inherit](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_settlement_as_close.inherit).

The Sharpe and Sortino ratios in the Strategy Tester module have updated calculations. Previously, the ratios used strategy returns over monthly periods if the trading range was three or more months and daily periods if the range was three or more days but less than three months. Both ratios now always use monthly periods for consistency.

### [June 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#june-2024)

We've added a new parameter to the [box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box.new), [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_label.new), [line.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_line.new), [polyline.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_polyline.new), and [table.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_table.new) functions:

- `force_overlay` - If true, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is false.

#### [Pine Script™ Enums](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-script-enums)

Enums, also known as *enumerations*, *enumerated types*, or [enum types](#enum-types), are unique data types with all possible values declared by the programmer. They can help programmers maintain more strict control over the values allowed by variables, conditional expressions, and [collections](#collections), and they enable convenient dropdown input creation with the new [input.enum()](#enum-input) function. See our User Manual's [Enums](#enums) page to learn more about these new types and how to use them.

### [May 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#may-2024)

We've added an optional `calc_bars_count` parameter to the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy), [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request.security),
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request.security_lower_tf), and [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request.seed) functions that allows users to limit the number of recent historical bars a script or data request can execute across. When a script's [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator) or [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy) declaration statement includes a `calc_bars_count` argument, its "Settings/Inputs" tab will include a "Calculated bars" input in the "Calculation" section. The default value in all these functions is 0, which signifies that the script or request executes across all the available data.

The `strategy.*` namespace features several new built-in variables:

- [strategy.avg_trade](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.avg_trade) -
  Returns the average amount of money gained or lost per trade.
  Calculated as the sum of all profits and losses divided by the
  number of closed trades.
- [strategy.avg_trade_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.avg_trade_percent) -
  Returns the average percentage gain or loss per trade. Calculated as
  the sum of all profit and loss percentages divided by the number of
  closed trades.
- [strategy.avg_winning_trade](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.avg_winning_trade) -
  Returns the average amount of money gained per winning trade.
  Calculated as the sum of profits divided by the number of winning
  trades.
- [strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent) -
  Returns the average percentage gain per winning trade. Calculated as
  the sum of profit percentages divided by the number of winning
  trades.
- [strategy.avg_losing_trade](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.avg_losing_trade) -
  Returns the average amount of money lost per losing trade.
  Calculated as the sum of losses divided by the number of losing
  trades.
- [strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent) -
  Returns the average percentage loss per losing trade. Calculated as
  the sum of loss percentages divided by the number of losing trades.

#### [Pine Profiler](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-profiler)

Our new
[Pine Profiler](#pine-profiler) is a powerful utility that analyzes the executions of all
significant code in a script and displays helpful performance
information next to the code lines *inside* the Pine Editor. The
[Profiler](#pine-profiler)'s information provides insight into a script's runtime,
the distribution of runtime across significant code regions, and the
number of times each code region executes. With these insights,
programmers can effectively pinpoint performance *bottlenecks* and
ensure they focus on
[optimizing](#optimization) their code where it truly matters when they need to improve
execution times.

See the new
[Profiling and optimization](#profiling-and-optimization) page to learn more about the Profiler, how it works, and how
to use it to analyze a script's performance and identify optimization
opportunities.

#### [Pine Editor improvements](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-editor-improvements)

When opening the detached Pine Editor from a tab with a chart, it now
links directly to that tab, as indicated by the "Linked" status and
green icon in the bottom-right corner. While linked, the "Add to
chart", "Update on chart", and "Apply to entire layout" buttons
affect the charts on the main tab.

The detached Pine Editor now includes the Pine console.

### [April 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#april-2024)

We've added a new parameter to the
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot),
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotchar),
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotcandle),
[plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotbar),
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotarrow),
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotshape),
and
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_bgcolor)
functions:

- `force_overlay` - If true, the output will display on the main chart
  pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane.

### [March 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#march-2024)

The `syminfo.*` namespace features a new built-in variable:

- [syminfo.expiration_date](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_syminfo.expiration_date) -
  On non-continuous futures symbols, returns a UNIX timestamp
  representing the start of the last day of the current contract.

The
[time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_time)
and
[time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_time_close)
functions have a new parameter:

- `bars_back` - If specified, the function will calculate the
  timestamp from the bar N bars back relative to the current bar on
  its timeframe. It can also calculate the expected time of a future
  bar up to 500 bars away if the argument is a negative value.
  Optional. The default is 0.

### [February 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#february-2024)

We've added two new functions for working with strings:

- [str.repeat()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str.repeat) -
  Constructs a new string containing the source string repeated a
  specified number of times with a separator injected between each
  repeated instance.
- [str.trim()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str.trim) -
  Constructs a new string with all consecutive whitespaces and other
  control characters removed from the left and right of the source
  string.

The
[request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request.financial)
function now accepts "D" as a `period` argument, allowing scripts to
request available daily financial data.

For example:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Daily financial data demo")

//@variable The daily Premium/Discount to Net Asset Value for "AMEX:SPY"
float f1 = request.financial("AMEX:SPY", "NAV", "D")
plot(f1)
```

The `strategy.*` namespace features a new variable for monitoring
available capital in a strategy's simulation:

- [strategy.opentrades.capital_held](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.opentrades.capital_held) -
  Returns the capital amount currently held by open trades.

### [January 2024](https://www.tradingview.com#january-2024)

## [2023](https://www.tradingview.com#2023)

### [December 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#december-2023)

We've added `format` and `precision` parameters to all `plot*()`
functions, allowing indicators and strategies to selectively apply
formatting and decimal precision settings to plotted results in the
chart pane's y-axis, the script's status line, and the Data Window.
The arguments passed to these parameters supersede the values in the
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator)
and
[strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy)
functions. Both are optional. The defaults for these parameters are the
same as the values specified in the script's declaration statement.

For example:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My script", format = format.percent, precision = 4)

plot(close, format = format.price)           // Price format with 4-digit precision.
plot(100 * bar_index / close, precision = 2) // Percent format with 2-digit precision.
```

### [November 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#november-2023)

We've added the following variables and functions to the `strategy.*`
namespace:

- [strategy.grossloss_percent](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy.grossloss_percent) -
  The total gross loss value of all completed losing trades, expressed
  as a percentage of the initial capital.

### [October 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#october-2023)

#### [Pine Script™ Polylines](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-script-polylines)

Polylines are drawings that sequentially connect the coordinates from an
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_array)
of up to 10,000
[chart points](#chart-points) using straight or *curved* line segments, allowing scripts
to draw custom formations that are difficult or impossible to achieve
using
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_line)
or [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_box)
objects. To learn more about this new drawing type, see the
[Polylines](#polylines)
section of our User Manual's page on
[Lines and boxes](#lines-and-boxes).

### [September 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#september-2023)

New functions were added:

- [strategy.default_entry_qty()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy.default_entry_qty) -
  Calculates the default quantity, in units, of an entry order from
  [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy.entry)
  or
  [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy.order)
  if it were to fill at the specified `fill_price` value.
- [chart.point.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_chart.point.new) -
  Creates a new
  [chart.point](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_chart.point)
  object with the specified `time`, `index`, and `price`.
- [request.seed()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dseed) -
  Requests data from a user-maintained GitHub repository and returns
  it as a series. An in-depth tutorial on how to add new data can be
  found [here](https://github.com/tradingview-pine-seeds/docs).
- [ticker.inherit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dinherit) -
  Constructs a ticker ID for the specified `symbol` with additional
  parameters inherited from the ticker ID passed into the function
  call, allowing the script to request a symbol's data using the same
  modifiers that the `from_tickerid` has, including extended session,
  dividend adjustment, currency conversion, non-standard chart types,
  back-adjustment, settlement-as-close, etc.
- [timeframe.from_seconds()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_timeframe.from_seconds) -
  Converts a specified number of `seconds` into a valid timeframe
  string based on our [timeframe specification
  format](#timeframe-string-specifications).

The `dividends.*` namespace now includes variables for retrieving future
dividend information:

- [dividends.future_amount](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_dividends.future_amount) -
  Returns the payment amount of the upcoming dividend in the currency
  of the current instrument, or `na` if this data isn't available.
- [dividends.future_ex_date](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_dividends.future_ex_date) -
  Returns the Ex-dividend date (Ex-date) of the current instrument's
  next dividend payment, or `na` if this data isn't available.
- [dividends.future_pay_date](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_dividends.future_pay_date) -
  Returns the Payment date (Pay date) of the current instrument's
  next dividend payment, or `na` if this data isn't available.

The
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request.security_lower_tf)
function has a new parameter:

- `ignore_invalid_timeframe` - Determines how the function behaves
  when the chart's timeframe is smaller than the `timeframe` value in
  the function call. If `false`, the function will raise a runtime
  error and halt the script's execution. If `true`, the function will
  return `na` without raising an error.

Users can now explicitly declare variables with the `const`, `simple`,
and `series` type qualifiers, allowing more precise control over the
types of variables in their scripts. For example:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My script")

//@variable A constant `string` used as the `title` in the `plot()` function.
const string plotTitle = "My plot"
//@variable An `int` variable whose value is consistent after the first chart bar.
simple int a = 10
//@variable An `int` variable whose value can change on every bar.
series int b = bar_index

plot(b % a, title = plotTitle)
```

### [August 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#august-2023)

Added the following alert
[placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000531021):

- `{{syminfo.currency}}` - Returns the currency code of the current
  symbol ("EUR", "USD", etc.).
- `{{syminfo.basecurrency}}` - Returns the base currency code of the
  current symbol if the symbol refers to a currency pair. Otherwise,
  it returns `na`. For example, it returns "EUR" when the symbol is
  "EURUSD".

#### [Pine Script™ Maps](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-script-maps)

Maps are collections that hold elements in the form of *key-value
pairs*. They associate unique keys of a *fundamental type* with values
of a *built-in* or
[user-defined](#user-defined-types) type. Unlike [arrays](#arrays),
these collections are *unordered* and do not utilize an internal lookup
index. Instead, scripts access the values of maps by referencing the
*keys* from the key-value pairs put into them. For more information on
these new collections, see our
[User Manual's page on Maps](#maps).

### [July 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#july-2023)

sizes of limit orders incorrectly due to improper tick rounding of the
`limit` price.

Added a new built-in variable to the `strategy.*` namespace:

- [strategy.margin_liquidation_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy%7Bdot%7Dmargin_liquidation_price) -
  When a strategy uses margin, returns the price value after which a
  margin call will occur.

  Returns the two-letter code of the country where the symbol is
  traded.

A new display parameter for all `input.*()` functions was added.
It provides you with more control over the display of input values next to a script's name.
Four arguments can be used:
[display.status_line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_display%7Bdot%7Dstatus_line),
[display.data_window](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_display%7Bdot%7Ddata_window),
[display.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_display%7Bdot%7Dall),
and
[display.none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_display%7Bdot%7Dnone).
Combinations of these arguments using plus or minus signs are allowed, and regardless of the argument used,
input values will always continue to appear in the `Inputs` tab of the script's settings.

### [May 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#may-2023)

and
[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dexit)
functions:

- `disable_alert` - Disables order fill alerts for any orders placed
  by the function.

Our "Indicator on indicator" feature, which allows a script to pass
another indicator's plot as a source value via the
[input.source()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsource)
function, now supports multiple external inputs. Scripts can use a
multitude of external inputs originating from up to 10 different
indicators.

We've added the following array functions:

- [array.every()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Devery) -
  Returns `true` if all elements of the `id` array are `true`, `false`
  otherwise.

  Returns `true` if at least one element of the `id` array is `true`,
  `false` otherwise. These functions also work with arrays of
  [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_int)
  and
  [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_float)
  types, in which case zero values are considered `false`, and all others
  `true`.

### [April 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#april-2023)

Fixed an issue with trailing stops in
[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dexit)
being filled on high/low prices rather than on intrabar prices.

Fixed behavior of
[array.mode()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_array%7Bdot%7Dmode),
[matrix.mode()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_matrix%7Bdot%7Dmode)
and
[ta.mode()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dmode).
Now these functions will return the smallest value when the data has no
most frequent value.

### [March 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#march-2023)

It is now possible to use seconds-based timeframe strings for the
`timeframe` parameter in
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)
and
[request.security_lower_tf()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity_lower_tf).

- [request.currency_rate()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dcurrency_rate) -
  provides a daily rate to convert a value expressed in the `from`
  currency to another in the `to` currency.

### [February 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#february-2023)

#### [Pine Script™ Methods](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-script-methods)

Pine Script™ methods are specialized functions associated with specific
instances of built-in or user-defined types. They offer a more
convenient syntax than standard functions, as users can access methods
in the same way as object fields using the handy dot notation syntax.
Pine Script™ includes built-in methods for
[array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_array),
[matrix](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_matrix),
[line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_line),
[linefill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_linefill),
[label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_label),
[box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_box),
and
[table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#type_table)
types and facilitates user-defined methods with the new
[method](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#kw_method)
keyword. For more details on this new feature, see our
[User Manual's page on methods](#methods).

### [January 2023](https://www.tradingview.com#january-2023)

New array functions were added:

Pine objects are instantiations of the new user-defined composite types
(UDTs) declared using the
[type](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#kw_type)
keyword. Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as method-less
classes. They allow users to create custom types that organize different
values under one logical entity. A detailed rundown of the new
functionality can be found in our [User Manual's page on
objects](#objects).

A new function was added:

- [ticker.standard()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dstandard) -
  Creates a ticker to request data from a standard chart that is
  unaffected by modifiers like extended session, dividend adjustment,
  currency conversion, and the calculations of non-standard chart
  types: Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc.

New `strategy.*` functions were added:

- [strategy.opentrades.entry_comment()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dentry_comment) -
  The function returns the comment message of the open trade's entry.

  The function returns the comment message of the closed trade's
  exit.

### [November 2022](https://www.tradingview.com#november-2022)

Fixed behaviour of
[math.round_to_mintick()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_math%7Bdot%7Dround_to_mintick)
function. For 'na' values it returns 'na'.

### [October 2022](https://www.tradingview.com#october-2022)

Pine Script™ now has a new, more powerful and better-integrated editor.
Read [our
blog](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/new-vsc-style-pine-script-editor-34159/)

New overload for the
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_fill)
function was added. Now it can create vertical gradients. More info
about it in the [blog
post](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/pine-script-vertical-gradients-33586/).

A new function was added:

- [str.format_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dformat_time) -
  Converts a timestamp to a formatted string using the specified
  format and time zone.

### [September 2022](https://www.tradingview.com#september-2022)

The `text_font_family` parameter now allows the selection of a monospace
font in
[label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew),
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)
and
[table.cell()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_table%7Bdot%7Dcell)
function calls, which makes it easier to align text vertically. Its
arguments can be:

  Specifies the default font.
- [font.family_monospace](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_font%7Bdot%7Dfamily_monospace) -
  Specifies a monospace font.

The accompanying setter functions are:

- [label.set_text_font_family()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dset_text_font_family) -
  The function sets the font family of the text inside the label.
- [box.set_text_font_family()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text_font_family) -

### [August 2022](https://www.tradingview.com#august-2022)

A new label style
[label.style_text_outline](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_label%7Bdot%7Dstyle_text_outline)
was added.

A new parameter for the
[ta.pivot_point_levels()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivot_point_levels)
function was added:

- `developing` - If `false`, the values are those calculated the last
  time the anchor condition was true. They remain constant until the
  anchor condition becomes true again. If `true`, the pivots are
  developing, i.e., they constantly recalculate on the data developing
  between the point of the last anchor (or bar zero if the anchor
  condition was never true) and the current bar. Cannot be `true` when
  `type` is set to `"Woodie"`.

A new parameter for the
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)
function was added:

- `text_wrap` - It defines whether the text is presented in a single
  line, extending past the width of the box if necessary, or wrapped
  so every line is no wider than the box itself.

This parameter supports two arguments:

- [text.wrap_none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_text%7Bdot%7Dwrap_none) -
  Disabled wrapping mode for
  [box.new](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  and
  [box.set_text_wrap](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text_wrap)
  functions.
- [text.wrap_auto](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_text%7Bdot%7Dwrap_auto) -
  Automatic wrapping mode for
  [box.new](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  and
  [box.set_text_wrap](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text_wrap)
  functions.

New built-in functions were added:

- [ta.min()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dmin) -
  Returns the all-time low value of `source` from the beginning of the
  chart up to the current bar.
- [ta.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dmax) -
  Returns the all-time high value of `source` from the beginning of
  the chart up to the current bar.

A new annotation `//@strategy_alert_message` was added. If the
annotation is added to the strategy, the text written after it will be
automatically set as the default alert message in the [Create
Alert] window.

```
//@version=5
// @strategy_alert_message My Default Alert Message
strategy("My Strategy")
plot(close)
```

### [July 2022](https://www.tradingview.com#july-2022)

It is now possible to fine-tune where a script's plot values are
displayed through the introduction of new arguments for the `display`
parameter of the
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot),
[plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotchar),
[plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotshape),
[plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotarrow),
[plotcandle()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotcandle),
and
[plotbar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plotbar)
functions.

Four new arguments were added, complementing the previously available
[display.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_display%7Bdot%7Dall)
and
[display.none](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_display%7Bdot%7Dnone):

- [display.data_window](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_display%7Bdot%7Ddata_window)
  displays the plot values in the Data Window, one of the items
  available from the chart's right sidebar.
- [display.pane](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_display%7Bdot%7Dpane)
  displays the plot in the pane where the script resides, as defined
  in with the `overlay` parameter of the script's
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator),
  [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy),
  or
  [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_library)
  declaration statement.
- [display.price_scale](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_display%7Bdot%7Dprice_scale)
  controls the display of the plot's label and price in the price
  scale, if the chart's settings allow them.
- [display.status_line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_display%7Bdot%7Dstatus_line)
  displays the plot values in the script's status line, next to the
  script's name on the chart, if the chart's settings allow them.

The `display` parameter supports the addition and subtraction of its
arguments:

- `display.all - display.status_line` will display the plot's
  information everywhere except in the script's status line.
- `display.price_scale + display.status_line` will display the plot in
  the price scale and status line only.

### [June 2022](https://www.tradingview.com#june-2022)

The behavior of the argument used with the `qty_percent` parameter of
[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dexit)
has changed. Previously, the percentages used on successive exit orders
of the same position were calculated from the remaining position at any
given time. Instead, the percentages now always apply to the initial
position size. When executing the following strategy, for example:

```
//@version=5
strategy("strategy.exit() example", overlay = true)
strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, qty = 100)
strategy.exit("Exit Long1", "Long", trail_points = 50, trail_offset = 0, qty_percent = 20)
strategy.exit("Exit Long2", "Long", trail_points = 100, trail_offset = 0, qty_percent = 20)
```

20% of the initial position will be closed on each
[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dexit)
call. Before, the first call would exit 20% of the initial position, and
the second would exit 20% of the remaining 80% of the position, so only
16% of the initial position.

Two new parameters for the built-in
[ta.vwap()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dvwap)
function were added:

- `anchor` - Specifies the condition that triggers the reset of VWAP
  calculations. When `true`, calculations reset; when `false`,
  calculations proceed using the values accumulated since the previous
  reset.
- `stdev_mult` - If specified, the
  [ta.vwap()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dvwap)
  calculates the standard deviation bands based on the main VWAP
  series and returns a `[vwap, upper_band, lower_band]` tuple.

New overloaded versions of the
[strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclose)
and
[strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclose_all)
functions with the `immediately` parameter. When `immediately` is set to
`true`, the closing order will be executed on the tick where it has been
placed, ignoring the strategy parameters that restrict the order
execution to the open of the next bar.

New built-in functions were added:

- [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_timeframe%7Bdot%7Dchange) -
  Returns `true` on the first bar of a new `timeframe`, `false`
  otherwise.
- [ta.pivot_point_levels()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dpivot_point_levels) -
  Returns a float array with numerical values representing 11 pivot
  point levels: `[P, R1, S1, R2, S2, R3, S3, R4, S4, R5, S5]`. Levels

indicator("array.new<float> example")
length = 5
var a = array.new<float>(length, close)
if array.size(a) == length
    array.remove(a, 0)

strings, and introduce regular expressions to Pine Script™:

- [str.contains(source,
  str)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dcontains) -
  Determines if the `source` string contains the `str` substring.
- [str.pos(source,
  str)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dpos) -
  Returns the position of the `str` string in the `source` string.
- [str.substring(source, begin_pos,
  end_pos)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dsubstring) -
  Extracts a substring from the `source` string.
- [str.replace(source, target, replacement,
  occurrence)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dreplace) -
  Contrary to the existing
  [str.replace_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dreplace_all)
  function, `str.replace()` allows the selective replacement of a
  matched substring with a replacement string.
- [str.lower(source)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dlower)
  and
  [str.upper(source)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dupper) -
  Convert all letters of the `source` string to lower or upper case:
- [str.startswith(source,
  str)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dstartswith)
  and [str.endswith(source,
  str)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dendswith) -
  Determine if the `source` string starts or ends with the `str`
  substring.
- [str.match(source,
  regex)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_str%7Bdot%7Dmatch) -
  Extracts the substring matching the specified [regular
  expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Perl_and_PCRE).

#### [Textboxes](https://www.tradingview.com#textboxes)

Box drawings now supports text. The
[box.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)
function has five new parameters for text manipulation: `text`,
`text_size`, `text_color`, `text_valign`, and `text_halign`.
Additionally, five new functions to set the text properties of existing
boxes were added:

- [box.set_text()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text)
- [box.set_text_color()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text_color)
- [box.set_text_size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text_size)
- [box.set_text_valign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text_valign)
- [box.set_text_halign()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dset_text_halign)

#### [New built-in variables](https://www.tradingview.com#new-built-in-variables)

Added new built-in variables that return the `bar_index` and `time`
values of the last bar in the dataset. Their values are known at the
beginning of the script's calculation:

- [last_bar_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_last_bar_index) -
  Bar index of the last chart bar.
- [last_bar_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_last_bar_time) -
  UNIX time of the last chart bar.

New built-in `source` variable:

- [hlcc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_hlcc4) -
  A shortcut for `(high + low + close + close)/4`. It averages the
  high and low values with the double-weighted close.

### [November 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#november-2021)

#### [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com#forin)

Added a new
[for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_for%7Bdot%7D%7Bdot%7D%7Bdot%7Din)
operator to iterate over all elements of an array:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
int[] a1 = array.from(1, 3, 6, 3, 8, 0, -9, 5)

highest(array) =>
    var int highestNum = na
    for item in array
            if na(highestNum) or item > highestNum
        highestNum := item
    highestNum

plot(highest(a1))
```

#### [Function overloads](https://www.tradingview.com#function-overloads)

Added function overloads. Several functions in a script can now share
the same name, as long one of the following conditions is true:

- Each overload has a different number of parameters:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Function overload")

// Two parameters
mult(x1, x2) =>
    x1 * x2

// Three parameters
mult(x1, x2, x3) =>
    x1 * x2 * x3

plot(mult(7, 4))
plot(mult(7, 4, 2))
```

- When overloads have the same number of parameters, all parameters in
  each overload must be explicitly typified, and their type
  combinations must be unique:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Function overload")

// Accepts both 'int' and 'float' values - any 'int' can be automatically cast to 'float'
mult(float x1, float x2) =>
    x1 * x2

// Returns a 'bool' value instead of a number
mult(bool x1, bool x2) =>
    x1 and x2 ? true : false

mult(string x1, string x2) =>
    str.tonumber(x1) * str.tonumber(x2)

// Has three parameters, so explicit types are not required
mult(x1, x2, x3) =>
    x1 * x2 * x3

plot(mult(7, 4))
plot(mult(7.5, 4.2))
plot(mult(true, false) ? 1 : 0)
plot(mult("5", "6"))
plot(mult(7, 4, 2))
```

#### [Currency conversion](https://www.tradingview.com#currency-conversion)

Added a new [currency] argument to most `request.*()`
functions. If specified, price values returned by the function will be
converted from the source currency to the target currency. The following
functions are affected:

- [request.dividends()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Ddividends)
- [request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dearnings)
- [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dfinancial)
- [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity)

### [October 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#october-2021)

Pine Script™ v5 is here! This is a list of the **new** features added to
the language, and a few of the **changes** made. See the Pine Script™ v5
[Migration guide](#to-pine-version-5) for
a complete list of the **changes** in v5.

#### [New features](https://www.tradingview.com#new-features)

Libraries are a new type of publication. They allow you to create custom
functions for reuse in other scripts. See this manual's page on
[Libraries](#libraries).

Pine Script™ now supports
[switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#kw_switch)
structures! They provide a more convenient and readable alternative to
long ternary operators and
[if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#kw_if)
statements.

[while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#kw_while)
loops are here! They allow you to create a loop that will only stop when
its controlling condition is false, or a `break` command is used in the
loop.

New built-in array variables are maintained by the Pine Script™ runtime
to hold the IDs of all the active objects of the same type drawn by your
script. They are
[label.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_label%7Bdot%7Dall),
[line.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_line%7Bdot%7Dall),
[box.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_box%7Bdot%7Dall)
and
[table.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_table%7Bdot%7Dall).

The
[runtime.error()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_runtime%7Bdot%7Derror)
function makes it possible to halt the execution of a script and display
a runtime error with a custom message. You can use any condition in your
script to trigger the call.

Parameter definitions in user-defined functions can now include a
default value: a function defined as `f(x = 1) => x` will return 1 when
called as `f()`, i.e., without providing an argument for its `x`
parameter.

New variables and functions provide better script visibility on strategy
information:

- [strategy.closedtrades.entry_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dentry_price)
  and
  [strategy.opentrades.entry_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dentry_price)

- [strategy.closedtrades.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dsize)
  and
  [strategy.opentrades.size()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dsize)
- [strategy.closedtrades.profit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dprofit)
  and
  [strategy.opentrades.profit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dprofit)
- [strategy.closedtrades.commission()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dcommission)
  and
  [strategy.opentrades.commission()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dcommission)
- [strategy.closedtrades.max_runup()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dmax_runup)
  and
  [strategy.opentrades.max_runup()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dmax_runup)
- [strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dmax_drawdown)
  and
  [strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dopentrades%7Bdot%7Dmax_drawdown)
- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_price()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dexit_price)
- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dexit_bar_index)
- [strategy.closedtrades.exit_time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclosedtrades%7Bdot%7Dexit_time)
- [strategy.convert_to_account()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dconvert_to_account)
- [strategy.convert_to_symbol()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dconvert_to_symbol)
- [strategy.account_currency](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_strategy%7Bdot%7Daccount_currency)

A new
[earnings.standardized](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#const_earnings%7Bdot%7Dstandardized)
constant for the
[request.earnings()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dearnings)
function allows requesting standardized earnings data.

A v4 to v5 converter is now included in the Pine Script™ Editor. See the
Pine Script™ v5 [Migration guide](#to-pine-version-5) for more information on converting your scripts to v5.

The [Reference
Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/) now
includes the systematic mention of the form and type (e.g., "simple
int") required for each function parameter.

The User Manual was
reorganized and new content was added.

#### [Changes](https://www.tradingview.com#changes)

Many built-in variables, functions and function arguments were renamed
or moved to new namespaces in v5. The venerable `study()`, for example,
is now
[indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator),
and `security()` is now
[request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request%7Bdot%7Dsecurity).
New namespaces now group related functions and variables together. This
consolidation implements a more rational nomenclature and provides an
orderly space to accommodate the many additions planned for Pine
Script™.

See the Pine Script™ v5
[Migration guide](#to-pine-version-5) for
a complete list of the **changes** made in v5.

### [September 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#september-2021)

New parameter has been added for the `dividends()`, `earnings()`,
`financial()`, `quandl()`, `security()`, and `splits()` functions:

- `ignore_invalid_symbol` - determines the behavior of the function if
  the specified symbol is not found: if `false`, the script will halt
  and return a runtime error; if `true`, the function will return `na`
  and execution will continue.

### [July 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#july-2021)

`tostring` now accepts "bool" and "string" types.

New argument for `time` and `time_close` functions was added:

- `timezone` - timezone of the `session` argument, can only be used
  when a session is specified. Can be written out in GMT notation
  (e.g. "GMT-5") or as an [IANA time zone database
  name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
  (e.g. "America/New_York").

It is now possible to place a drawing object in the future with
`xloc = xloc.bar_index`.

New argument for `study` and `strategy` functions was added:

- `explicit_plot_zorder` - specifies the order in which the
  indicator's plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, the
  plots will be drawn based on the order in which they appear in the
  indicator's code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous
  ones.

### [June 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#june-2021)

New variable was added:

- `barstate.islastconfirmedhistory` - returns `true` if script is
  executing on the dataset's last bar when market is closed, or
  script is executing on the bar immediately preceding the real-time
  bar, if market is open. Returns `false` otherwise.

New function was added:

- `round_to_mintick(x)` - returns the value rounded to the symbol's
  mintick, i.e. the nearest value that can be divided by
  `syminfo.mintick`, without the remainder, with ties rounding up.

Expanded `tostring()` functionality. The function now accepts three new
formatting arguments:

- `format.mintick` to format to tick precision.
- `format.volume` to abbreviate large values.
- `format.percent` to format percentages.

### [May 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#may-2021)

Improved backtesting functionality by adding the Leverage mechanism.

Added support for table drawings and functions for working with them.
Tables are unique objects that are not anchored to specific bars; they
float in a script's space, independently of the chart bars being viewed
or the zoom factor used. For more information, see the
[Tables](#tables) User Manual page.

New functions were added:

- `color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp)` - creates a new color with
  transparency using the RGB color model.
- `color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color)` -
  returns color calculated from the linear gradient between
  bottom_color to top_color.
- `color.r(color)`, `color.g(color)`, `color.b(color)`,
  `color.t(color)` - retrieves the value of one of the color
  components.
- `array.from()` - takes a variable number of arguments with one of
  the types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `label`, `line`,
  `color`, `box`, `table` and returns an array of the corresponding
  type.

A new `box` drawing has been added to Pine Script™, making it possible
to draw rectangles on charts using the Pine Script™ syntax. For more
details see the Pine Script™
[reference](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)
and the [Lines and boxes](#lines-and-boxes) User Manual page.

The `color.new` function can now accept series and input arguments, in
which case, the colors will be calculated at runtime. For more
information about this, see our [Colors](#colors) User Manual page.

### [April 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#april-2021)

New math constants were added:

- `math.pi` - is a named constant for Archimedes' constant. It is
  equal to 3.1415926535897932.
- `math.phi` - is a named constant for the golden ratio. It is equal
  to 1.6180339887498948.
- `math.rphi` - is a named constant for the golden ratio conjugate. It
  is equal to 0.6180339887498948.
- `math.e` - is a named constant for Euler's number. It is equal to
  2.7182818284590452.

New math functions were added:

- `round(x, precision)` - returns the value of `x` rounded to the
  nearest integer, with ties rounding up. If the precision parameter
  is used, returns a float value rounded to that number of decimal
  places.
- `median(source, length)` - returns the median of the series.
- `mode(source, length)` - returns the mode of the series. If there
  are several values with the same frequency, it returns the smallest
  value.
- `range(source, length)` - returns the difference between the `min`
  and `max` values in a series.
- `todegrees(radians)` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in
  degrees from an angle measured in radians.
- `toradians(degrees)` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in
  radians from an angle measured in degrees.
- `random(min, max, seed)` - returns a pseudo-random value. The
  function will generate a different sequence of values for each
  script execution. Using the same value for the optional seed
  argument will produce a repeatable sequence.

New functions were added:

- `session.ismarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part of
  the regular trading hours (i.e. market hours), `false` otherwise.
- `session.ispremarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part
  of the pre-market, `false` otherwise.
- `session.ispostmarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part
  of the post-market, `false` otherwise.
- `str.format` - converts the values to strings based on the specified
  formats. Accepts certain `number` modifiers: `integer`, `currency`,
  `percent`.

### [March 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#march-2021)

New assignment operators were added:

- `+=` - addition assignment
- `-=` - subtraction assignment
- `*=` - multiplication assignment
- `/=` - division assignment
- `%=` - modulus assignment

New parameters for inputs customization were added:

- `inline` - combines all the input calls with the same inline value
  in one line.
- `group` - creates a header above all inputs that use the same group
  string value. The string is also used as the header text.
- `tooltip` - adds a tooltip icon to the `Inputs` menu. The tooltip
  string is shown when hovering over the tooltip icon.

New argument for `fill` function was added:

- `fillgaps` - controls whether fills continue on gaps when one of the
  `plot` calls returns an `na` value.

A new keyword was added:

- `varip` - is similar to the `var` keyword, but variables declared
  with `varip` retain their values between the updates of a real-time
  bar.

New functions were added:

- `tonumber()` - converts a string value into a float.
- `time_close()` - returns the UNIX timestamp of the close of the
  current bar, based on the resolution and session that is passed to
  the function.
- `dividends()` - requests dividends data for the specified symbol.
- `earnings()` - requests earnings data for the specified symbol.
- `splits()` - requests splits data for the specified symbol.

New arguments for the study() function were added:

- `resolution_gaps` - fills the gaps between values fetched from
  higher timeframes when using `resolution`.
- `format.percent` - formats the script output values as a percentage.

### [February 2021](https://www.tradingview.com#february-2021)

New variable was added:

- `time_tradingday` - the beginning time of the trading day the
  current bar belongs to.

- `str.split()` - splits a string at a given substring separator.

### [November 2020](https://www.tradingview.com#november-2020)

- New `max_labels_count` and `max_lines_count` parameters were added
  to the study and strategy functions. Now you can manage the number
  of lines and labels by setting values for these parameters from 1 to
  500.

New function was added:

- `array.range()` - return the difference between the min and max
  values in the array.

### [October 2020](https://www.tradingview.com#october-2020)

The behavior of `rising()` and `falling()` functions have changed. For
example, `rising(close,3)` is now calculated as following:

```
close[0] > close[1] and close[1] > close[2] and close[2] > close[3]
```

### [September 2020](https://www.tradingview.com#september-2020)

Added support for `input.color` to the `input()` function. Now you can
provide script users with color selection through the script's
"Settings/Inputs" tab with the same color widget used throughout the
TradingView user interface. Learn more about this feature in our
[blog](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/create-color-inputs-in-pine-20751/)

```
//@version=4
study("My Script", overlay = true)
color c_labelColor = input(color.green, "Main Color", input.color)
var l = label.new(bar_index, close, yloc = yloc.abovebar, text = "Colored label")
label.set_x(l, bar_index)
label.set_color(l, c_labelColor)
```

![image](images/input_color.BV9qKm_h_2a3e7N.png)

Added support for arrays and functions for working with them. You can
now use the powerful new array feature to build custom datasets. See our
[User Manual page on
arrays](#arrays)
and our
[blog](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/arrays-are-now-available-in-pine-script-20052/)

```
//@version=4

  code of the current symbol. For EURUSD symbol returns EUR.

### [May 2020](https://www.tradingview.com#may-2020)

- `else if` statement was added
- The behavior of `security()` function has changed: the `expression`
  parameter can be series or tuple.

  `plotshape()`, and `plotchar()` functions is now 0%.
- For the functions `plot()`, `plotshape()`, `plotchar()`,
  `plotbar()`, `plotcandle()`, `plotarrow()`, you can set the
  `display` parameter, which controls the display of the plot. The
  following values can be assigned to it:
    - `display.none` - the plot is not displayed
    - `display.all` - the plot is displayed (Default)
- The `textalign` argument was added to the `label.new` function along
  with the `label.set_textalign` function. Using those, you can

  For example, if you don't specify exit parameters for
  `strategy.exit` - `profit`, `limit`, `loss`, `stop` or one of the
  following pairs: `trail_offset` and `trail_price` / `trail_points` -
  you will see a warning message in the console in the Pine Script™
  editor.
- Increased the maximum number of arguments in `max`, `min`, `avg`
  functions. Now you can use up to ten arguments in these functions.

### [October 2019](https://www.tradingview.com#october-2019)

- `plotchar()` function now supports most of the Unicode symbols:

```
//@version=4
study("My Script", overlay=true)
plotchar(open > close, char="🐻")

.. image:: images/ReleaseNotes-Bears_in_plotchar.png
```

- New `bordercolor` argument of the `plotcandle()` function allows you
  to change the color of candles' borders:

```
//@version=4
study("My Script")
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, title='Title', color = open < close ? color.green : color.red, wickcolor=color.black, bordercolor=color.orange)
```

- New variables added:
    - `syminfo.description` - returns a description of the current
      symbol
    - `syminfo.currency` - returns the currency code of the current
      symbol (EUR, USD, etc.)
    - `syminfo.type` - returns the type of the current symbol (stock,
      futures, index, etc.)

### [September 2019](https://www.tradingview.com#september-2019)

New parameters to the `strategy` function were added:

- `process_orders_on_close` allows the broker emulator to try to
  execute orders after calculating the strategy at the bar's close
- `close_entries_rule` allows to define the sequence used for closing
  positions

Some fixes were made:

- `fill()` function now works correctly with `na` as the `color`
  parameter value
- `sign()` function now calculates correctly for literals and
  constants

`str.replace_all(source, target, replacement)` function was added. It
replaces each occurrence of a `target` string in the `source` string
with a `replacement` string

### [July-August 2019](https://www.tradingview.com#july-august-2019)

New variables added:

- `timeframe.isseconds` returns true when current resolution is in
  seconds
- `timeframe.isminutes` returns true when current resolution is in
  minutes
- `time_close` returns the current bar's close time

The behavior of some functions, variables and operators has changed:

- The `time` variable returns the correct open time of the bar for
  more special cases than before
- An optional *seconds* parameter of the `timestamp()` function allows
  you to set the time to within seconds
- `security()` function:

    - Added the possibility of requesting resolutions in seconds:

      1, 5, 15, 30 seconds (chart resolution should be less than or
      equal to the requested resolution)
    - Reduced the maximum value that can be requested in some of the
      other resolutions:

      from 1 to 1440 minutes

      from 1 to 365 days

      from 1 to 52 weeks

      from 1 to 12 months
- Changes to the evaluation of ternary operator branches:

  In Pine Script™ v3, during the execution of a ternary operator, both
  its branches are calculated, so when this script is added to the
  chart, a long position is opened, even if the long() function is not
  called:

```
//@version=3
strategy(title = "My Strategy")
long() =>
    strategy.entry("long", true, 1, when = open > high[1])
    1
c = 0
c := true ? 1 : long()
plot(c)

Pine Script™ v4 contains built-in functions with side effects ( ``line.new`` and ``label.new`` ). If calls to these functions are present in both branches of a ternary operator, both function calls would be executed following v3 conventions. Thus, in Pine Script™ v4, only the branch corresponding to the evaluated condition is calculated. While this provides a viable solution in some cases, it will modify the behavior of scripts which depended on the fact that both branches of a ternary were evaluated. The solution is to pre-evaluate expressions prior to the ternary operator. The conversion utility takes this requirement into account when converting scripts from v3 to v4, so that script behavior will be identical in v3 and v4.
```

      you just bought a security and held onto it without trading.
    - Added percentage values to the absolute currency values.
    - Added Buy & Hold Return to display the final value of Buy & Hold
      Equity based on last price.
    - Added Sharpe Ratio — it shows the relative effectiveness of the

      a worse price than expected. It can be set through the
      Properties dialog or through the slippage argument in the
      `strategy()` function.
    - Commission allows yot to add commission for placed orders in
      percent of order value, fixed price or per contract. The amount
      of commission paid is shown in the Commission Paid field. The
      commission size and its type can be set through the Properties
      dialog or through the commission_type and commission_value
      arguments in the `strategy()` function.

## [2016](https://www.tradingview.com#2016)

### [December 2016](https://www.tradingview.com#december-2016)

- Added backtesting functionality to Pine Script™. It is now possible
  to create trading strategies, i.e. scripts that can send, modify and
  cancel orders to buy or sell. Strategies allow you to perform
  backtesting (emulation of strategy trading on historical data) and
  forward testing (emulation of strategy trading on real-time data)
  according to your algorithms. Detailed information about the
  strategy's calculations and the order fills can be seen in the
  newly added Strategy Tester tab.

### [July 2015](https://www.tradingview.com#july-2015)

- A new `editable` parameter allows hiding the plot from the Style
  menu in the indicator settings so that it is not possible to edit

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Migration guides](#overview)/Overview

# [Overview](https://www.tradingview.com#overview)

The migration guides catalogue all changes introduced between Pine Script™ versions and explain how to rewrite code to convert the indicator successfully. Each guide details sequential changes; for example, the [To Pine Script™ version 6](#to-pine-version-6) page assumes that the script is already written in Pine v5.

## [Pine converter](https://www.tradingview.com#pine-converter)

Scripts written in every Pine Script version starting from v3 can be converted to the next version automatically using the converter available in the "Manage Scripts" menu:

#### To Pine Script™ version 6](#to-pine-version-6)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Migration guides](#overview)/To Pine Script™ version 6

# [To Pine Script™ version 6](https://www.tradingview.com#to-pine-script-version-6)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

Pine Script v6 introduces a number of changes and new features. See the [Release Notes](#release-notes) for a list of all new features.

Some changes are not compatible with v5 scripts. This guide explains how to update your script from v5 to v6. If you want to convert a script from v4 or earlier to v6, refer to the migration guides for previous versions and update the script one version at a time.

The Pine Editor converter can handle many of these changes *automatically*, while other changes might require *manual* fixes.

Here are the changes that affect v5 scripts:

- Values of the "int" and "float" types are no longer implicitly cast to "bool".
- Boolean values can no longer be [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na), and the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na), [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz), and [fixnan()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fixnan) functions no longer accept "bool" arguments.
- The [and](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_and) and [or](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_or) operators now evaluate conditions lazily.
- All `request.*()` functions can now execute dynamically.
- Division of two "const int" values can now return a fractional value.
- The `when` parameter is removed from all applicable `strategy.*()` functions.
- The default long and short margin percentage for strategies is now 100.
- Strategies now trim the oldest orders in their results instead of raising an error when they exceed the 9000 trade limit.
- The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command no longer ignores relative parameters defining take-profit and stop-loss prices or trailing stop activation levels when the call also includes arguments for the related absolute parameters.
- The history-referencing operator [[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D) can no longer reference the history of literal values or fields of user-defined types directly.
- Function calls can no longer include more than one argument for the same parameter.
- The `offset` parameter of [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) and other functions no longer accepts "series" values.
- [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values are no longer allowed in place of built-in constants of unique types.
- The value of [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) now always includes a multiplier (e.g., `"1D"` instead of `"D"`).
- Some `array.*()` functions now accept negative index arguments.
- Some mutable variables are no longer erroneously marked as "const".
- The `transp` parameter is removed from all applicable functions.
- Some default colors and color constants have updated values.
- The [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop statement now evaluates its end boundary dynamically before every iteration.

## [Converting v5 to v6 using the Pine Editor](https://www.tradingview.com#converting-v5-to-v6-using-the-pine-editor)

The Pine Editor can automatically convert a v5 script to v6. The Pine Editor highlights the `//@version=5`[annotation](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#an_@version=) of a v5 script in yellow.

To convert the script, click the editor's "Manage script" dropdown menu and select "Convert code to v6":

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Convert-button.BbP6b2UG_ZIeE3O.png)

A script can be converted only if its v5 code compiles successfully. In rare cases, converting the script automatically can result in a v6 script with compilation errors. In that case, the errors are highlighted in the Editor, and you need to resolve them by using the information in the following sections.

## [Dynamic requests](https://www.tradingview.com#dynamic-requests)

In Pine v6, scripts can call all `request.*()` functions *dynamically by default*, allowing any single `request.*()` call instance in the code to request data from different datasets and work within local scopes.

When a script does *not* use [dynamic requests](#dynamic-requests), the *context* of a data request (ticker ID and timeframe) must be known on the first script execution and remain *unchanged* across all subsequent executions. Therefore, `symbol`, `timeframe`, and other parameters specifying a non-dynamic `request.*()` call's context require arguments with the "simple" qualifier. Additionally, non-dynamic requests must execute globally, meaning they are not allowed inside the local scopes of [loops](#loops) and other structures.

In contrast, when a script allows dynamic requests, it can call `request.*()` functions with *"series" arguments* for the parameters that define the context of the data requests. With this qualifier change, scripts can:

- Retrieve data from new datasets on *any* historical bar, even *after* the first available bar, with a single `request.*()` call instance.
- Store symbol and timeframe strings in [collections](#collections) or [objects](#objects), then use the collected values to define a `request.*()` call's context.
- Call `request.*()` functions within the local scopes of [loops](#loops) and [conditional structures](#conditional-structures).
- [Export library functions](#library-functions) containing `request.*()` calls.

*Non-dynamic* requests are the default in Pine v5. Scripts coded in v5 can execute dynamic requests, but only if programmers specify `dynamic_requests = true` in the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), or [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_library) declaration statement. If not specified, the default argument is `false`.

In Pine v6, dynamic requests are *always* available by default. When a script includes `request.*()` calls, the compiler analyzes the script to determine whether dynamic requests are necessary. If unnecessary for the script, the compiler automatically turns the feature off to optimize performance.

The following v6 example uses a single [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) instance in a [loop](#loops) to retrieve data for multiple symbols stored in an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array). On each iteration, the script dynamically retrieves the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) price for one of the stored symbols from the "1D" timeframe and [pushes](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.push) the retrieved value into an array. After the loop terminates, it calculates that array's [average](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.avg) and plots the result. In Pine v5, this script would cause a *compilation error* unless we included `dynamic_requests = true` in the declaration statement:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Dynamic-requests.CU--JEtI_Z1wsCBX.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Dynamic `request` demo")
//For v5: must add `dynamic_requests = true` to `indicator()` for this code to work.

//@variable User-input toggle to display each symbol's `close` price on chart alongside average `close`.
bool showSymbols = input.bool(false, "Plot symbol closes")

//@variable Persistent array of "string" symbol ticker IDs to request for our custom index.
var array<string> symbols = array.from("NASDAQ:MSFT", "NASDAQ:AAPL", "NASDAQ:GOOGL", "NASDAQ:NVDA")

//@variable Array storing the `close` prices for the `symbols` on each bar.
array<float> symCloses = array.new<float>()

// Loop through `symbols` and request daily `close` prices. 
for [i, sym] in symbols
    float reqClose = request.security(sym, "1D", close)
    symCloses.push(reqClose)

// Calculate and plot the average `close` for the `symbols` to create our custom index plot.
float avgClose = symCloses.avg()
plot(avgClose, "Avg close", avgClose >= avgClose[1] ? color.green : color.red, 3) 

// Plot each symbol's `close` for reference if `showSymbols` is `true`.
plot(showSymbols ? symCloses.get(0) : na, "MSFT", color.blue)
plot(showSymbols ? symCloses.get(1) : na, "AAPL", color.navy)
plot(showSymbols ? symCloses.get(2) : na, "GOOGL", color.aqua)
plot(showSymbols ? symCloses.get(3) : na, "NVDA", color.teal)
```

There are minor differences between dynamic and non-dynamic requests in some obscure cases, such as when using the result of one [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) call in the `expression` argument of another call. As a result, a valid v5 script without dynamic requests can behave differently after conversion to v6, even if nothing related to the requests was changed in the code.

**Fix:** In Pine v6, the `dynamic_requests` parameter of the [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator), [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy), and [library()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_library) functions is `true` by default. If you find differences in a `request.*()` call's behavior after converting a script to v6, you can include `dynamic_requests = false` in the declaration statement to force dynamic requests off and replicate most of the previous v5 behavior.

It's important to note that, in Pine v5, it is possible to call user-defined functions or methods containing `request.*()` calls inside the local blocks of loops and conditional structures *without* enabling dynamic requests. However, such calls still require *"simple"* arguments for all parameters defining the requested context, which limits their utility.

In Pine v6, calling a `request.*()` function from the scope of a loop or conditional structure is **not allowed** if `dynamic_requests` is set to `false` in the script's declaration statement, even if the call is within a user-defined function. A v6 script that attempts to use wrapped `request.*()` calls in local scopes without dynamic requests enabled causes a *compilation error*.

**Fix:** If a v5 script specifies `dynamic_requests` is `false` in its declaration statement and uses functions containing `request.*()` calls inside local blocks, remove the explicit `dynamic_requests` argument when converting the script to v6. The converted script will use [dynamic requests](#dynamic-requests) automatically, allowing the functions containing `request.*()` calls to work correctly inside local scopes.

## [Types](https://www.tradingview.com#types)

The following changes have been made to how Pine handles types.

### [Explicit "bool" casting](https://www.tradingview.com#explicit-bool-casting)

In Pine v6, "int" and "float" values are no longer implicitly cast to "bool".

In Pine v5, values of "int" and "float" types can be implicitly cast to "bool" when an expression or function requires a boolean value. In such cases, `na`, `0`, or `0.0` are considered `false`, and *any other value* is considered `true`.

For example, take a look at this conditional expression:

```
color expr = bar_index ? color.green : color.red
```

It assigns `color.red` to `expr` on the *first* bar of the chart, because that bar has a `bar_index` of 0, and then assigns `color.green` on *every* following bar, because any *non-zero* value is `true`. The ternary operator [`?:`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_?:) expects a "bool" expression for its condition, but in v5 it can also accept a numeric value as its conditional expression, which it automatically converts (implicitly casts) to a "bool".

In v6, scripts must *explicitly* cast a numeric value to "bool" to use it where a "bool" type is required.

**Fix:** Wrap the numeric value with the [`bool()`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bool) function to cast it explicitly.

```
color expr = bool(bar_index) ? color.green : color.red
```

### [Boolean values cannot be `na`](https://www.tradingview.com#boolean-values-cannot-be-na)

In v6, "bool" values can no longer be `na`. Consequently, the [`na()`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na), [`nz()`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz), and [`fixnan()`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fixnan) functions no longer accept "bool" types.

In v5, "[bool](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_bool)" variables have *three* possible values: they can be `true`, `false`, or `na`. The boolean `na` value behaves differently from both `true` and `false`:

- When implicitly cast to "bool", `na` is evaluated as `false`.
- The boolean `na` value is **not** considered equal to `false` when compared using the `==` operator.
- When the boolean `na` value is passed to the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) function, it returns `true`, whereas `na(true)` and `na(false)` both return `false`.

To manage the boolean `na` value, the [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na), [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz), and [fixnan()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fixnan) functions in v5 have overloads that accept "bool" type arguments. This third boolean state leads to occasional confusion in v5 scripts.

In v6, this is no longer the case: a "bool" must be *either*`true` or `false`, with **no** third state. This means that in v6 scripts:

- A variable declared as "bool" can **no longer** be assigned `na` as its default value.
- In conditional expressions like [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#kw_if) and [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch), if the return type of the expression is "bool", any *unspecified* condition returns `false` instead of `na`.
- Expressions that returned a boolean `na` value in v5 now return `false`. For example, using the history-referencing operator `[]` on the very first bar of the dataset to request a historical value of a "bool" variable returned `na` in v5, because no past bars exist, but in Pine v6 it returns `false`.
- Functions that explicitly check whether a value is `na` – specifically, [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na), [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz), and [fixnan()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fixnan) – do **not** accept "bool" arguments in v6.

This example v5 script creates a simple [strategy](#strategies) that switches between long and short positions when two moving averages cross. An [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)-statement assigns `true` or `false` to a "bool" variable `isLong` to track the trade's long or short direction, using the strategy's positive (> 0) or negative (< 0) [position size](#position-sizing). However, when the position size is zero, *neither* of these conditions are valid. In v5, the undefined condition (== 0) assigns `na` to the variable `isLong`.

Therefore, a boolean `na` value occurs on the first few bars in the dataset before the strategy enters any positions. We can visualize the three "bool" states by setting the [background color](#backgrounds) based on the value of `isLong`:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-No-bool-na-1.B7b5WX8__ZhfW1O.png)

```
//@version=5
strategy("Bool `na` demo v5", overlay=true, margin_long=100, margin_short=100)

// Strategy's long and short trades are based on moving average cross over/under.
longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (shortCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)

//@variable Boolean variable that tracks the current direction of the trade.
// Is `true` when `position_size` is greater than 0 (long), and `false` when `position_size` is less than 0 (short).
bool isLong = if strategy.position_size > 0
    true
else if strategy.position_size < 0
    false
// When `position_size` is equal to 0, neither condition is met. In v5, an undefined condition sets `isLong` to `na`.

//@variable Background color, set depending on the state of `isLong` (`true`/`false`/`na`).
color stateColor = switch
    isLong == true  => color.new(color.blue, 90)        // Blue color if long position.
    isLong == false => color.new(color.orange, 90)      // Orange color if short position.
    na(isLong)      => color.new(color.red, 40)         // Red color if no position. Note this line is invalid in v6.
bgcolor(stateColor)

// On the first bar, display the raw value of `isLong` in a table.
if barstate.isfirst
    var table t = table.new(position. bottom_right, 2, 4, color.yellow, frame_color = color.black, frame_width = 1)
    t.cell(0, 0, "On first bar")
    t.cell(0, 1, "`isLong` raw value:", bgcolor = color.new(color.red, 40))
    t.cell(1, 1, str.tostring(isLong), bgcolor = color.new(color.red, 40))
    // Compare `isLong` value to Boolean `true` and `false` values.
    t.cell(0, 2, "`isLong` == `true`?")
    t.cell(1, 2, str.tostring(isLong == true))
    t.cell(0, 3, "`isLong` == `false`?")
    t.cell(1, 3, str.tostring(isLong == false))
```

**Fix:** Remove any [na()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na), [nz()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_nz), and [fixnan()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fixnan) functions that run on "bool" values. Ensure that all "bool" values are correctly interpreted as `true` or `false` states **only**. If your code logic requires a third [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) state to execute as intended, rewrite the code using a different type or structure to achieve the previous three-state behavior.

To adapt our code to Pine v6, we must first remove the following line to resolve the initial compilation error:

```
na(isLong)      => color.new(color.red, 40)
```

In v6, the undefined condition (`strategy.position_size == 0`) now returns `false` instead of `na`. Consequently, the script *incorrectly* highlights the bars where there are *no* trade positions the same color as those where there are *short* positions, since `isLong` has the same `false` result for both conditions:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-No-bool-na-2.BCM2Ys_b_Z1lBgK8.png)

We want to distinguish between *three* unique states: long positions, short positions, and no entered positions. Therefore, using a two-state Boolean variable in v6 is no longer suitable. Instead, to maintain our desired behavior, we must *rewrite* the v6 code to replace the "bool" variable with a different type. For example, we can use an "int" variable to represent our three different `position_size` states using -1, 0, and 1:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-No-bool-na-3.C2oMRPfl_ZJu6OY.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Bool `na` demo v6", overlay=true, margin_long=100, margin_short=100) 

// Strategy's long and short trades are based on moving average cross over/under. 
longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (shortCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)

//@variable Integer variable that tracks the current direction of the trade. 
// Is `-1` when `position_size` is less than 0 (short), `+1` when `position_size` is greater than 0 (long), 
//  and `0` when `position_size` is equal to 0 (no trades).
int tradeDirection = if strategy.position_size < 0 
    -1
else if strategy.position_size > 0 
    1
else    //strategy.position_size == 0 
    0

//@variable Background color, set depending on the `tradeDirection`.
color directionColor = switch
    tradeDirection == 1  => color.new(color.blue, 90)        // Blue color if long position.
    tradeDirection == -1 => color.new(color.orange, 90)      // Orange color if short position.
    tradeDirection == 0  =>  na                                // No color if no position.
bgcolor(directionColor)

// On the first bar, display the value of `tradeDirection` in a table for reference.
var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 2, 3, color.yellow, frame_color = color.black, frame_width = 1)
if barstate.isfirst
    t.cell(0, 0, "On first bar")
    t.cell(0, 1, "`tradeDirection` value:", bgcolor = color.new(color.green, 60))
    t.cell(1, 1, str.tostring(tradeDirection), bgcolor = color.new(color.green, 60))

    //@variable A "string" representation of `tradeDirection` value on current bar.
    string directionString = tradeDirection == 1 ? "Long" : tradeDirection == -1 ? "Short" : "No entered positions"
    t.cell(0, 2, "State: ")
    t.cell(1, 2, directionString)

if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable A "string" representation of `tradeDirection`  value on current bar.
    string directionString = tradeDirection == 1 ? "Long" : tradeDirection == -1 ? "Short" : "No entered positions"
    label.new(bar_index, high, "On last bar \n `tradeDirection` value: " + str.tostring(tradeDirection) 
         + "\n State: " + directionString)
```

### [Unique parameters cannot be `na`](https://www.tradingview.com#unique-parameters-cannot-be-na)

Some Pine Script function parameters expect values of *unique* types. For example, the `style` parameter of the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function expects a value of the "input plot_style" qualified type, which must be one of the constants in the `plot.style_*` group.

In v5, passing [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) to the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function's `style` parameter simply plots a line using the default style `plot.style_line`, without raising an error.

In v6, parameters that expect unique types **no longer** accept [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) values. Additionally, [conditional expressions](#conditional-structures) that return these unique types must be used in a form that **cannot** result in an [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value. For example, a [switch](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_switch)-statement must have a `default` block, and an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)-statement must have an `else`-block, because these conditional expressions can return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) otherwise.

The following example script shows two code structures that work in v5 but raise errors in v6.

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-No-enum-na.Rirf8rCY_ZFlyGA.png)

```
//@version=5
indicator("`na` and unique types demo v5")

//@variable User-selected "string" to determine type of plot used for `plot()` function's `style` argument.
string inputStyle = input.string("Area", "Plot style", options = ["Area", "Columns", "Histogram", "Stepline-diamond"])

// Initialize an `input plot_style` type variable based on user's selected `inputStyle`.
selectedPlotStyle = switch inputStyle
    "Area"             => plot.style_area
    "Columns"          => plot.style_columns
    "Histogram"        => plot.style_histogram
    "Stepline-diamond" => plot.style_stepline_diamond
// `switch` statement covers all `inputStyle` options, but does not include `default` block.
// Valid in v5. Invalid in v6 - `switch` statement must include a `default` block, otherwise raises error.

plot(close, "Source plot", color.blue, 2, style = selectedPlotStyle)

//@variable Toggle for the style of the line plotted at price "100".
inputHundredStyle = input.bool(true, " Use crosses style for '100-line'")

hundredLineStyle = if inputHundredStyle
    plot.style_cross
// Since there is no `else` block, setting `inputHundredStyle` to `false` makes this variable `na`.
// In v5, passing `na` to the `style` parameter makes the `plot()` function use its default style `plot.style_line`.
// In v6, this raises a compilation error because `style` cannot be `na`.

// Plot the "100-line" using the `hundredLineStyle` style constant.
plot(100, "100-line", color.orange, 4, style = hundredLineStyle)
```

**Fix:** Ensure that no [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value is passed to parameters that expect unique types, and that all conditional statements return a suitable non-[na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) value.

```
//@version=6
indicator("`na` and unique types demo v6")

//@variable User-selected "string" to determine type of plot used for `plot()` function's `style` argument.
string inputStyle = input.string("Area", "Plot style", options = ["Area", "Columns", "Histogram", "Stepline-diamond"])

// Initialize an `input plot_style` type variable based on user's selected `inputStyle`.
selectedPlotStyle = switch inputStyle
    "Area"             => plot.style_area
    "Columns"          => plot.style_columns
    "Histogram"        => plot.style_histogram
    "Stepline-diamond" => plot.style_stepline_diamond
    // A default block must be included in v6.
    =>  plot.style_line

plot(close, "Source plot", color.blue, 2, style = selectedPlotStyle)

//@variable Toggle for the style of the line plotted at price "100".
inputHundredStyle = input.bool(true, " Use crosses style for '100-line'")

hundredLineStyle = if inputHundredStyle
    plot.style_cross
else    //`else` block must be included in v6. Sets "line" style if `inputHundredStyle` is `false`.
    plot.style_line

// Plot the "100-line" using the `hundredLineStyle` style constant.
plot(100, "100-line", color.orange, 4, style = hundredLineStyle)
```

## [Constants](https://www.tradingview.com#constants)

The following changes have been made to how Pine handles constant values.

### [Fractional division of constants](https://www.tradingview.com#fractional-division-of-constants)

Dividing two integer "const" values can return a fractional value.

In v5, the result of the division of two "int" values is inconsistent. If *both* values are qualified as "const", the script performs what is known as *integer division*, and discards any fractional remainder in the result, e.g., `5/2 = 2`. However, if *at least one* of the integers is qualified as "input", "simple", or "series", the script *preserves* the fractional remainder in the division result: `5/2 = 2.5`.

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-No-int-division-1.vzmEC1NZ_ZLqSka.png)

```
//@version=5
indicator("`int` division demo")

// `float` division produces fractional remainder in both v5 and v6.
plot( 5.0 / 2.0, "`float` values", color.blue)

// `const int` division produces rounded-down result in v5. In v6, it produces a fractional remainder.
plot( 5 / 2,           "`const int` values",     color.orange)
plot( int(5) / int(2), "values wrapped `int()`", color.red)

// Wrapped `int()` division produces rounded down result in both v5 and v6.
plot( int(5 / 2), "result wrapped `int()`", color.green)

// Using `input int` type in division preserves the fractional remainder in both v5 and v6.
inputNum = input.int(2, "Division int", minval = 1)
plot( 5 / inputNum, "`input int` value", color.purple)
```

In v6, dividing two "int" values that are not evenly divisible *always* results in a number with a *fractional value*, regardless of the type and qualifier of the two arguments used. Therefore, the v6 division result is `5/2 = 2.5`, even if both values involved are "const int".

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-No-int-division-2.DNd_hajv_1TwdjI.png)

**Fix:** If you need an "int" division result *without* a fractional value, wrap the division with the [int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_int) function to cast the *result* to "int", which discards the fractional remainder. Alternatively, use [math.round()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.round), [math.floor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.floor), or [math.ceil()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.ceil) to *round* the division result in a specific direction.

### [Mutable variables are always "series"](https://www.tradingview.com#mutable-variables-are-always-series)

In Pine v5, some mutable variables are qualified as "series" values but are *erroneously* qualified as "const". This behavior is incorrect and allows a programmer to pass them where "series" variables are usually not accepted.

For example, the [ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema) function expects its `length` argument to be an integer qualified as "simple" or weaker (see the [Qualifiers hierarchy](#qualifiers)). In the example script below the `seriesLen` variable is effectively a "series" type because its value changes between bars. In v5, `seriesLen`*can* be passed to [ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.ema). Although this does not raise an error, it does not work as expected, because only its *first* recorded value `1` is used as the `length` in the script:

```
//@version=5
indicator("`const` mutable variables demo")

// Variable is effectively of `series int` type. 
var seriesLen = 0
seriesLen += 1

// `ta.ema()` only uses `length = 1` throughout execution, even as `seriesLen` changes.
plot(ta.ema(close, seriesLen))
```

In v6, `seriesLen` is correctly parsed as a "series int" type, and raises a compilation error if passed in place of the expected "simple int" argument for `length`.

**Fix:** Pass values of the expected qualified type to built-in functions. In our example, set the `length` argument to a "const int" value.

```
//@version=6
indicator("`const` mutable variables demo")

// Variable is now of `const int` type.
var seriesLen = 1

// `ta.ema()` uses `length = 1` throughout execution.
plot(ta.ema(close, seriesLen))
```

### [Color changes](https://www.tradingview.com#color-changes)

The color values behind some of the `color.*` constants have changed in Pine v6 to better reflect the TradingView palette:

Constant namePine v5 colorPine v6 colorcolor.red#FF5252#F23645color.teal#00897B#089981color.yellow#FFEB3B#FDD835Additionally, the default text color for [label.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_label.new) is now `color.white` in v6 (previously `color.black` in v5) to ensure that the text is more visible against the default `color.blue` label.

### [Removal of `when` parameter](https://www.tradingview.com#removal-of-when-parameter)

The `when` parameter for order creation functions was deprecated in v5 and is removed in v6. An order is created only if the `when` condition is `true`, which is its default value. This parameter affects the following functions: [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry), [strategy.order()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.order), [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit), [strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close), [strategy.close_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.close_all), [strategy.cancel()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel), and [strategy.cancel_all()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.cancel_all).

The following example strategy shows the use of the `when` parameter, and works in v5 but not v6.

```
//@version=5
strategy("Conditional strategy", overlay=true)

longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long, when = longCondition)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short, when = shortCondition)
```

**Fix:** To trigger the order creation conditionally, use [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) statements instead.

```
//@version=6
strategy("Conditional strategy", overlay=true)

longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if longCondition
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if shortCondition
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)
```

### [Default margin percentage](https://www.tradingview.com#default-margin-percentage)

The default margin percentage for strategies is now 100.

In v5, the default value of the `margin_long` and `margin_short` parameters is 0, which means that the strategy **does not check** its available funds before creating or managing orders. It can create orders that require *more* money than is available, and will **not** close short orders even when they lose more money than available to the strategy.

In *Pine v6*, the default margin percentage is 100. The strategy **does not open** entries that require more money than is available, and short orders are *margin called* if too much money is lost.

For example, we can see the difference in strategy behavior by running this simple strategy on the "ARM" symbol's 4h chart using the v5 and v6 default margin values. When using Pine v5, there are no margin calls:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Margin-calls-1.CnzpPLkm_1lRc8h.png)

```
//@version=5
strategy("My strategy", overlay=true, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value=100)
// v6 defaults: margin_long=100, margin_short=100 
// v5 defaults: margin_long=0, margin_short=0

longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (shortCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)
```

However, if we adjust this script to `//@version=6` on the same chart, we see that it triggers 14 margin calls because of the new margin percentages:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Margin-calls-2.DY4IZ4xs_ZukbpG.png)

**Fix:** To replicate the previous v5 behavior, set the [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy) function's `margin_short` and `margin_long` arguments to 0.

### [Excess orders are trimmed](https://www.tradingview.com#excess-orders-are-trimmed)

Strategy orders above the 9000 limit are trimmed (removed) in v6.

In v5, outside of Deep Backtesting, when a strategy creates more than 9000 orders, it raises a runtime error and halts any further calculations.

For example, this strategy script places several orders on each bar in the dataset. As a result, it can quickly surpass the 9000 order limit and trigger an error in Pine v5:

```
//@version=5
strategy("Strategy order limit demo", overlay=true, pyramiding=5)

// Place several long orders on every even bar. This reaches the maximum orders limit in v5 and raises a runtime error.
if bar_index % 2 == 0
    for i = 1 to 5
        strategy.entry("Entry " + str.tostring(i), strategy.long, qty = 5)
// Place short orders on every odd bar.
else
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short, qty = 25)
```

In v6, when the total number of orders exceeds 9000, the strategy does *not* halt. Instead, the orders are *trimmed* from the beginning until the limit is reached, meaning that the strategy only stores the information for the most recent orders.

Trimmed orders no longer show in the Strategy Tester, and referencing them using the `strategy.closedtrades.*` functions returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na). Use [strategy.closedtrades.first_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_strategy.closedtrades.first_index) to get the index of the first *non-trimmed* trade:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Order-trimming.CFIVLCGx_Z2iQqmO.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("Strategy order limit demo", overlay=true, pyramiding=5)

//@variable Count of total orders placed.
var int totalOrders = 0

// Place several long orders on every even bar.
if bar_index % 2 == 0
    for i = 1 to 5
        strategy.entry("Entry " + str.tostring(i), strategy.long, qty = 5)
        totalOrders += 1
// Place short orders on every odd bar.
else
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short, qty = 25)
    totalOrders += 1

// Display total orders and index of first non-trimmed trade in a table cell on last bar.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 3, color.yellow, color.black, 1)
    // Display total orders and closed trades counts.
    string ordersText = "Total orders: " + str.tostring(totalOrders, "#,###")
         + "\n Closed trades: " + str.tostring(strategy.closedtrades, "#,###")
    t.cell(0, 0, ordersText, text_halign = text.align_right, text_size = size.large)

    // Display the first non-trimmed trade index and its entry price.
    string firstTradeIndex = str.tostring(strategy.closedtrades.first_index, "#,###")
    string firstTradePrice = str.tostring(strategy.closedtrades.entry_price(strategy.closedtrades.first_index), "$##.##")
    string firstTradeText = str.format("Index of first non-trimmed trade: {0}\nEntry price of trade #{0}: {1}", firstTradeIndex, firstTradePrice)
    t.cell(0, 1, firstTradeText, text_halign = text.align_right, text_size = size.large, bgcolor = #61dd5165)

    // Trying to reference the trimmed trades (e.g., first closed trade) returns `na`.
    if totalOrders > 9000
        string trimmedTradePrice = "Entry price of trade #0: " + str.tostring(strategy.closedtrades.entry_price(0))
        t.cell(0, 2, trimmedTradePrice, text_size = size.large, bgcolor = #dd51c665)
```

### [`strategy.exit()` evaluates parameter pairs](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyexit-evaluates-parameter-pairs)

The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) function has three sets of *relative* and *absolute* parameters that define price levels for exit order calculations. The relative parameters `profit`, `loss`, and `trail_points` specify the [take-profit](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) and [stop-loss](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) levels and [trailing stop](#trailing-stops) activation level as *tick distances* from the entry price. In contrast, the absolute parameters `limit`, `stop`, and `trail_price` specify the exit and trail activation *prices* directly.

In Pine v5, a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call containing arguments for both the relative and absolute parameters that define a price level for the same exit order always prioritizes the *absolute* parameter and ignores the relative one. For instance, a call that includes a `limit` and `profit` argument consistently places take-profit orders at the `limit` value. It never places an exit order using the `profit` distance.

In Pine v6, if a [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call contains arguments for related absolute and relative parameters, it evaluates *both* specified levels and uses the one that the market price is expected to *trigger first*.

The example below demonstrates how the behavior of this command differs for v5 and v6 scripts. This v5 script creates a long [market order](#market-orders) and an exit order [bracket](#take-profit-and-stop-loss) on each 28th bar. The [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) call contains arguments for the relative parameters that determine take-profit and stop-loss levels (`profit` and `loss`), and it includes arguments for the absolute parameters (`limit` and `stop`). The `profit` and `loss` arguments are both 0, which would result in consistent exits at the entry price if the command used them. However, the command never uses these values to determine the exit order levels because the `limit` and `stop` parameters *always* take precedence when they have specified values:

![image](images/To-pine-version-6-Strategies-Strategy-exit-evaluates-parameter-pairs-1.Bq0Yb_zb_jLvAa.png)

```
//@version=5
strategy("`strategy.exit()` with parameter pairs demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@variable The 14-bar Average True Range. 
float atr = ta.atr(14)

if bar_index % 28 == 0
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)
    strategy.exit("Exit", "Buy", profit = 0, limit = close + 2.0 * atr, loss = 0, stop = close - 2.0 * atr)
```

If we convert the script to Pine v6, its behavior changes. Instead of prioritizing the absolute `limit` and `stop` parameters exclusively, the [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) command always prioritizes the price levels that will trigger exits *first*. In this example, the market price reaches the `limit` or `stop` value *after* the `profit` and `loss` distance of 0 ticks. Consequently, the command ignores the `limit` and `stop` values and places its exit orders at the entry price, which causes the strategy to exit each trade immediately after opening it:

![image](images/To-pine-version-6-Strategies-Strategy-exit-evaluates-parameter-pairs-2.Q464KiWa_Z2rlE7N.png)

```
//@version=6
strategy("`strategy.exit()` with parameter pairs demo", overlay = true, margin_long = 100, margin_short = 100)

//@variable The 14-bar Average True Range. 
float atr = ta.atr(14)

if bar_index % 28 == 0
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long)
    strategy.exit("Exit", "Buy", profit = 0, limit = close + 2.0 * atr, loss = 0, stop = close - 2.0 * atr)
```

## [History-referencing operator](https://www.tradingview.com#history-referencing-operator)

Pine v6 contains several changes to referencing the history of values.

### [No history for literal values](https://www.tradingview.com#no-history-for-literal-values)

The history-referencing operator `[]` can no longer be used with literal values or built-in constants.

In v5, the history-referencing operator `[]` can be used with built-in constants, such as `true` and `color.red`, and with *literal*s, which are raw values used directly in a script that are not stored as variables, such as `6` or `"myString"`, etc.

However, referencing the history of a literal is usually redundant, because by definition every literal represents a fixed value. The only exception where the returned historic value may vary is if the historical offset points to a *non-existent* bar, in which case referencing the historic literal value returns [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na).

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-History-for-literals-1.CQYj6Sq2_ZChn43.png)

```
//@version=5
indicator("History-referencing on literals demo")

// These lines all use history-referencing on literals, which works in v5, but is not really useful to do here. 
plot(6[1], "6[1]", linewidth = 3)
bgcolor(true[10] ? color.orange[3] : na)
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Since "string literal" is only defined in the last bar scope, history-referencing here returns `na`.
    labelText = "string literal"[20]
    label.new(bar_index - 3, 3, labelText + ", more text", textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
    // Label output will only show ", more text" in v5, since `labelText` is `na`.

// In v6, using any history-referencing on literals or built-in constants causes an error.
```

In *Pine v6*, you can **no longer** use the history-referencing operator `[]` on literals or built-in constants. Trying to do so triggers a compilation error.

**Fix:** Remove any `[]` operators used with literals or constants.

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-History-for-literals-2.DnTquvm7_1nXvDJ.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("History-referencing on literals demo")

// We no longer use history-referencing on literals in v6. 
plot(6, "6", linewidth = 3)
bgcolor(true ? color.orange : na)
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    labelText = "string literal"
    label.new(bar_index - 3, 3, labelText + ", more text", textcolor = color.white, size = size.large)
    // Label output shows "string literal, more text" in v6, since `labelText` is defined without history-referencing anymore.
```

### [History of UDT fields](https://www.tradingview.com#history-of-udt-fields)

The history-referencing operator `[]` can no longer be used directly on fields of user-defined types.

In v5, you can use the history-referencing operator `[]` on the *fields* of [*user-defined types*](#objects). While this does not cause any compilation errors, the behavior itself is erroneous.

For example, the script below draws an arrow [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_label) on each bar and displays its percentage increase/decrease. The label style, color, and text are set based on a bar's direction (`close > open`). The script defines a [UDT](#objects)`LblSettings` to initialize an object on each bar that stores these settings. On the last bar, it draws a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table) cell that displays the arrow direction and percentage difference from 10 bars back. In v5, we could use the history-referencing operator `[]` on the required `LblSettings` fields directly:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-History-for-UDTs.h94G4ccp_wdX75.png)

```
//@version=5
indicator("UDT history-referencing demo", overlay = true)

//@type A custom type to hold bar's `label` settings based on bar's direction.
//Includes bar direction, label style and color, and "string" percentage difference between bar's `open` and `close`. 
type LblSettings
    bool isUp = false
    string lblStyle
    color lblColor
    string diff

//@variable A `LblSettings` instance declared on every bar. 
LblSettings infoObject = LblSettings.new()

// Set the `LblSettings` object fields based on current bar's direction and price information.
infoObject.isUp := close > open
infoObject.lblStyle := infoObject.isUp ? label.style_arrowup : label.style_arrowdown
infoObject.lblColor := infoObject.isUp ? color.green : color.red
infoObject.diff := str.tostring((close - open) / open * 100, "#.##") + "%"

// Display a new `label` on each bar using its `infoObject` settings.
label.new(bar_index, high, infoObject.diff, style = infoObject.lblStyle, 
     color = infoObject.lblColor, textcolor = infoObject.lblColor)

// Highlight the bar that is 10 bars back from the last bar.
bgcolor(bar_index == last_bar_index - 10 ? color.yellow : na)

// On last bar, output table cell to display `LblSettings` object's `lblStyle` and `diff` fields from 10 bars back. 
if barstate.islast
    var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.yellow)

    // In v5, you could use history-referencing operator `[]` on UDT fields directly. 
    //@variable Text displayed in table cell. Set based on the `lblStyle` and `diff` fields from 10 bars back.
    string txt = "10 bars back: Arrow was " 
         + (infoObject.lblStyle[10] == label.style_arrowdown ? "DOWN" : "UP")
         + " by " + infoObject.diff[10]
    t.cell(0, 0, txt, text_size = size.large)
```

In *Pine v6*, you can **no longer** use the history-referencing operator `[]` on the field of a user-defined type directly.

**Fix:** Use the history-referencing operator on the UDT *object* instead, then retrieve the field of the historic object. To do so, use the syntax `(myObject[10]).field` - ensure the object's historical reference is wrapped in *parentheses*, otherwise it is invalid. Alternatively, assign the UDT *field* to a *variable* first, and then use the history-referencing operator `[]` on the variable to access its historic value.

```
// Reference history of object, then retrieve field of historic object.
[fieldType] historicFieldValue = (myObject[10]).field

// Alternative: Assign field to variable, then reference history of variable to get historic field value.
[fieldType] newVariable = myObject.field
[fieldType] historicFieldValue = newVariable[10]
```

Therefore, we can adjust the v5 code to access a historic instance of our `infoObject` on the last bar, wrapped in parentheses. Then, we retrieve our desired field values from the historic object `(infoObject[10])` to display the arrow direction and percentage difference from 10 bars back:

```
//@version=6
indicator("UDT history-referencing demo", overlay = true)

//@type A custom type to hold bar's `label` settings based on bar's direction.
//Includes bar direction, label style and color, and "string" percentage difference between bar's `open` and `close`. 
type LblSettings
    bool isUp = false
    string lblStyle
    color lblColor
    string diff

//@variable A `LblSettings` instance declared on every bar. 
LblSettings infoObject = LblSettings.new()

// Set the `LblSettings` object fields based on current bar's direction and price information.
infoObject.isUp := close > open
infoObject.lblStyle := infoObject.isUp ? label.style_arrowup : label.style_arrowdown
infoObject.lblColor := infoObject.isUp ? color.green : color.red
infoObject.diff := str.tostring((close - open) / open * 100, "#.##") + "%"

// Display a new `label` on each bar using its `infoObject` settings.
label.new(bar_index, high, infoObject.diff, style = infoObject.lblStyle, 
     color = infoObject.lblColor, textcolor = infoObject.lblColor)

// Highlight the bar that is 10 bars back from the last bar.
bgcolor(bar_index == last_bar_index - 10 ? color.yellow : na)

// On last bar, output table cell to display `LblSettings` object's `lblStyle` and `diff` fields from 10 bars back. 
if barstate.islast
    var table t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1, color.yellow)

    // In v6, cannot use `[]` on UDT fields (e.g., `infoObject.lblStyle[10]` is invalid).
    // Instead, Use `[]` to reference UDT object's history, wrapped in parentheses, then retrieve its fields.
    //@variable The `lblStyle` field value from 10 bars back. Is either `label.style_arrowdown` or `label.style_arrowup`.
    string historicArrowStyle = (infoObject[10]).lblStyle
    //@variable The `diff` field value (percentage difference between `close` and `open`) from 10 bars back.
    string historicPercentDifference = (infoObject[10]).diff

    //@variable Text displayed in table cell. Set based on the `lblStyle` and `diff` fields from 10 bars back.
    string txt = "10 bars back: Arrow was " 
         + (historicArrowStyle == label.style_arrowdown ? "DOWN" : "UP")
         + " by " + historicPercentDifference
    t.cell(0, 0, txt, text_size = size.large)
```

## [Timeframes must include a multiplier](https://www.tradingview.com#timeframes-must-include-a-multiplier)

The [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) variable holds a "string" that represents the chart's timeframe, typically consisting of a *quantity* (multiplier) and *unit*.

In v5, the [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) variable does *not* include a quantity when the chart timeframe has a multiplier of `1`. Instead, the string consists of only the timeframe unit, e.g., `"D"`, `"W"`, `"M"`. This is inconsistent with the timeframe strings for these same units at higher intervals, e.g., `"2D"`, `"3M"`.

To simplify the timeframe format in v6, the [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) variable now *always* includes a multiplier with its timeframe unit. So, `"D"` becomes `"1D"`, `"W"` becomes `"1W"`, and  `"M"` becomes `"1M"`.

This change might affect the behavior of older scripts that used `==` to compare the value of [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) with the "string" representation of a timeframe directly (e.g., `timeframe.period == "D"`).

To show the difference between the v5 and v6 [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) variables, we ran the script below on a daily chart (1D) for each Pine version. The script displays the [timeframe.period](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_timeframe.period) string in a [table](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_table), and compares the variable's value with the "string" literals `"D"` and `"1D"`:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Timeframe-multiplier.C0vAAkQ8_ZbC7c2.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("`timeframe.period` multiplier - v6")

//@function Compares `timeframe.period` to passed `timeframeString` and outputs result in selected table cell.
compareTF(string timeframeString, table t, int row) =>
    bool tfComparison = timeframe.period == timeframeString
    // Format table cell text and determine cell color based on comparison result.
    string displayText = "`timeframe.period` == '" + timeframeString + "'? " + str.tostring(tfComparison)
    color cellColor = tfComparison ? color.rgb(76, 175, 79, 40) : color.rgb(255, 82, 82, 40)
    // Display `tfComparison` result.
    t.cell(0, row, displayText, bgcolor = cellColor, text_halign = text.align_left, text_size = size.large)

// Display the chart's timeframe information in a table.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable Table displaying chart timeframe information.
    var table t = table.new(position.middle_center, 1, 3, #FFEB3B99, border_color = color.black, border_width = 1)

    //@variable The text to display in the table, consisting of the chart timeframe and multiplier.
    string tfInfo = "Chart timeframe: " + timeframe.period
         + "\n Chart multiplier: " + str.tostring(timeframe.multiplier) 

    t.cell(0, 0, tfInfo, text_halign = text.align_left, text_size = size.large)

    // Compare the current chart timeframe (daily chart) to timeframe strings with and without a multiplier.
    compareTF("D",  t, 1)
    compareTF("1D", t, 2)
```

**Fix:** In general, ensure that all timeframe strings include a multiplier. In this example, change the timeframe comparison "string" (`timeframe.period == "D"`) to ensure the "string" literal includes a multiplier (`timeframe.period == "1D"`).

## [Lazy evaluation of conditions](https://www.tradingview.com#lazy-evaluation-of-conditions)

The `and` and `or` conditions are now evaluated *lazily* rather than *strictly*.

An `and` condition is `true` if *all* of its arguments are `true`, which means that if the *first* argument is `false`, we can deduce that the whole condition is `false`, regardless of the value of the second argument. Conversely, an `or` condition is `true` when *at least one* of the arguments is `true`, so if the *first* argument is already `true`, then the whole condition is `true`, regardless of the second argument's state.

Pine v5 evaluates all [bool](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_bool) expressions except for the `?:`[ternary operator](#-ternary-operator)*strictly*, meaning the *second* part of a conditional expression is *always* evaluated, regardless of the value of the first argument.

Lazy evaluation can have consequences for script calculation. In the example below, we assign a value of `true` to the `signal` variable *only* when `close > open`*and*`ta.rsi(close, 14) > 50`. The [ta.rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi) function [must be executed on every bar](#historical-values-of-functions) in order to calculate its result correctly. In v5, the function *is* called on every bar, even when `close > open` is *not*`true`, due to the strict bool evaluation, and therefore the function calculates correctly.

```
//@version=5
indicator("Evaluation test v5")

//@variable A signal flag. Is `true` if two conditions `close > open` and `ta.rsi(close, 14) > 50` are both `true`.
bool signal = false

if close > open and ta.rsi(close, 14) > 50
    signal := true

// Highlight background on bars where `signal` is `true`.
bgcolor(signal ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na)
```

In v6, [bool](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_bool) expressions are evaluated *lazily*, which means the expression *stops evaluating* once it determines the overall condition's result, even if there are other arguments remaining in the expression.

If we convert the script above to v6, we see that the plotted signals *differ* between the two scripts. This variation occurs because of the lazy bool evaluation – since an `and` condition is only `true` if *all* its arguments are `true`, when `close > open` is `false`, the `and` condition is *definitely*`false` regardless of the second argument `ta.rsi(close, 14) > 50`. Consequently, the [ta.rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.rsi) call is *not* evaluated on every bar, which interferes with the internal history that the RSI function stores for its calculation and results in incorrect values:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Lazy-evaluation.DTwy6SAe_64SBs.png)

**Fix:** Ensure that the script evaluates all functions that rely on previous values on each bar. For example, extract calls that rely on historical context to the *global scope* and assign them to a variable. Then, reference that *variable* in the `and` and `or` conditions.

Note that you can and should take advantage of the lazy bool evaluation to create smarter, more concise code.

For example, the script below calls [array.first()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.first) on an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array) that is occasionally empty (on bars where `close > open` is `false`). In *Pine v5*, calling [array.first()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.first) on an empty array results in a runtime error, so you must keep the two [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if)-conditions that check the array size and first element separated in *different scopes* to avoid the error. However, in *Pine v6*, you can have the two conditions in the *same**scope* without error because the `and` condition's lazy evaluation ensures that [`array.first()`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.first) will only be called if `array.size() != 0` is `true` first:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Lazy evaluation error showcase")

array<bool> myArray = array.new<bool>()

if close > open
    myArray.push(true)

// Causes a runtime error in v5 when trying to call `array.first()` on an empty array.
// Works in v6 because `array.first()` is only called if the array is not empty.
if myArray.size() != 0 and myArray.first()
    label.new(bar_index, high, "Test")

// A correct approach for v5: `array.first()` is only called when we're sure the array is not empty.
if myArray.size() != 0 
    if myArray.first()
        label.new(bar_index, high, "Test")
```

## [Cannot repeat parameters](https://www.tradingview.com#cannot-repeat-parameters)

In v5, you can specify the same parameter in a function more than once. However, doing so raises a *compiler warning*, and only the *first* value will be used.

```
// In v5, compiles but raises warning. Only uses first value, so plot color will be `blue`.
plot(close, "Close", color = color.blue, linewidth = 2, color = color.red)
```

In v6, you can specify a parameter only *once*, and doing otherwise will result in a *compilation error*.

**Fix:** Remove the duplicate parameters.

```
// In v6, script will not compile if parameter is specified more than once.
plot(close, "Close", color = color.blue, linewidth = 2)
```

## [No series `offset` values](https://www.tradingview.com#no-series-offset-values)

The `offset` parameter can no longer accept "series" values

In Pine v5, the `offset` parameter in [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) and similar functions can accept "*series* int" arguments. However, passing a "series" argument raises a compiler warning, and the behavior is *incorrect*: only the *last* calculated offset is used on the whole chart, regardless of its previous values.

For example, this script uses `bar_index / 2` as a "series" `offset` argument while plotting the high points of each bar's body. Because the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) function uses only the *last*`offset` value, the plot appears offset by 10 bars here for the *entire* "GOOGL" 12M chart (since the chart's last `bar_index` is 20 here):

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-No-series-offset.DH-Z-RyE_Z1mLK8f.png)

```
//@version=5
indicator("`offset` parameter demo", overlay = true)

//@variable `series int` value. Used as `offset` parameter value in `plot()`.
int seriesOffset = bar_index / 2
// In v5, a `series` type `offset` value is valid, but only the last calculated value is used.  
plot(math.max(close, open),"", color.orange, 4, plot.style_stepline, offset = seriesOffset)
```

In v6, the `offset` parameter accepts an argument qualified as "*simple*" or weaker. The value used must be the same on every bar.

Remember that the Pine Script [qualifiers](#qualifiers) hierarchy means that a parameter expecting a "[simple](#simple)" value can also accept values qualified as "[input](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_input)" or "[const](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_const)". However, passing a "series" argument triggers a compilation error.

**Fix**: Change any "series" values passed to `offset` to "simple" values.

## [Minimum `linewidth` is 1](https://www.tradingview.com#minimum-linewidth-is-1)

In v5, the `linewidth` parameter of the [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) and [hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_hline) functions can accept a value smaller than 1, although the width on the chart will still appear as 1 for these drawings:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Minimum-linewidth-1.DK4UaZ1K_ZBnFll.png)

```
//@version=5
indicator("Linewidth demo")

//@variable User-input width for a line. Default value set to 0, with no minimum limit.
int userWidth = input.int(0, "Linewidth")

// Valid in v5, but line widths on chart all appear as `linewidth=1`. Not valid in v6.
plot(close,      "LW 1",   linewidth = 1)
plot(close + 5,  "LW 0",   linewidth = userWidth)
plot(close + 10, "LW -5",  linewidth = -5)
hline(240, "hline", color.maroon, linewidth = -3)
```

In v6, the `linewidth` argument **must** be 1 or greater. Passing a smaller value causes a compilation error.

**Fix:** Replace any `linewidth` argument that is smaller than 1 to ensure all width values are *at least* 1.

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Minimum-linewidth-2.BTZsUVkx_VCJPf.png)

```
//@version=6
indicator("Linewidth demo")

//@variable User-input width for a line. Default value set to 2, with minimum value set to 1.
int userWidth = input.int(2, "Linewidth", minval = 1)

// In v6, all line widths must be at least 1 or greater.
plot(close,      "LW 1",   linewidth = 1)
plot(close + 5,  "LW 2",   linewidth = userWidth)
plot(close + 10, "LW 5",   linewidth = 5)
hline(240, "hline", color.maroon, linewidth = 3)
```

## [Negative indices in arrays](https://www.tradingview.com#negative-indices-in-arrays)

Some array functions now accept negative indices.

In v5, array functions that require an element's *index* always expect a value *greater than or equal to 0*. Therefore, functions like [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get), [array.insert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.insert), [array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set), and [array.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.remove) raise a runtime error if a negative index is passed.

In v6, [array.get()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.get), [array.insert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.insert), [array.set()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.set), and [array.remove()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.remove) allow you to pass a *negative index* to request items from the *end* of the array. For example, `-1` refers to the last item in the array, `-2` refers to the second to last, and so forth.

```
//@variable Array of "int" numbers from 1 to 5.
array<int> countingArray = array.from(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// Array indexing starts from 0 to retrieve first element in both v5 and v6.
int firstValue = countingArray.get(0)       //Returns "1"

// In v6, can retrieve last array element using negative index. This index is invalid in v5.
int lastValue = countingArray.get(-1)       //Returns "5"

// Other `array.*()` functions also accept negative indexing in v6. These lines raise runtime errors in v5.
countingArray.set(-2, 10)                   // Updated array: [1, 2, 3, 10, 5]
countingArray.remove(-5)                    // Updated array: [2, 3, 10, 5]
countingArray.insert(-1, 20)                // Updated array: [2, 3, 10, 20, 5]
```

As a result, scripts that return a runtime error for using negative indices in v5 can be executed without error in v6.

However, if you create or update a script in v6, you must be aware of this new behavior to ensure that the script does not behave unexpectedly.

Keep in mind that negative indexing is still bound by the size of the array. Therefore, an array of 5 elements only accepts indexing from 0 to 4 (first to last element) or -1 to -5 (last to first element). Any other indices are out of bounds and raise a runtime error:

```
//@variable Array of "int" numbers from 1 to 5.
array<int> countingArray = array.from(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

// Trying to index negatively beyond the size of the array causes a runtime error.
countingArray.remove(-6)
```

## [The `transp` parameter is removed](https://www.tradingview.com#the-transp-parameter-is-removed)

In Pine v4 and earlier, [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot) and similar functions had a `transp` parameter that specified the transparency of the resulting plot.

Pine v5 deprecated and hid the `transp` parameter, because it is not fully compatible with the color system that Pine currently uses. Using both transparency settings together can result in unexpected behavior, as the `transp` parameter can get overwritten by the transparency of the color passed to the function. In v5, using the [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) function and not the `transp` parameter avoids any such conflicts.

Pine v6 removes the `transp` parameter completely from the following functions: [bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_bgcolor), [fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_fill), [plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plot), [plotarrow()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotarrow), [plotchar()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotchar), and [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape). Whenever the [converter](#converting-v5-to-v6-using-the-pine-editor) encounters a `transp` argument, it removes the argument from the converted v6 script.

**Fix:** To set the transparency of a drawn plot, use the [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) function. Pass the color value as the first argument, and the desired transparency value as the second.

For example, this v5 code uses the hidden `transp` parameter to set the color of the plot to `80` transparency:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Transparency demo v5")

color myColor = close > open ? color.green : color.red
plot(close, color = myColor, transp = 80)
```

In Pine v6, the same result can be achieved using [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new):

```
//@version=6
indicator("Transparency demo v6")

color myColor = close > open ? color.green : color.red
plot(close, color = color.new(myColor, 80))
```

If you need to preserve the color inputs in the "Settings/Style" menu, you must ensure that every color that gets passed to every [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_color.new) call is qualified as either "const" or "input". If at least one of these [color](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_color) values is calculated dynamically (like the code above), the color selector does not appear in the settings:

![image](images/MigrationGuideTov6-Transp-removed.UbKaK0oO_ZOtPJe.png)

You can learn more about why this happens and how to avoid it [here](#maintaining-automatic-color-selectors).

## [Dynamic `for` loop boundaries](https://www.tradingview.com#dynamic-for-loop-boundaries)

A [for](#for-loops) loop is a *count-controlled* loop that executes successive iterations of its local block based on a counter variable. The counter starts with an *initial value* (`from_num`) and increases or decreases by a fixed amount after every iteration until it reaches the specified *final value* (`to_num`).

In Pine v5, a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop statement establishes its final counter value strictly *before* starting its iterations. If the script changes the value of a variable or expression used as the loop's `to_num` argument during the loop's iterations, those changes do **not** affect the counter's boundaries. This behavior differs from [while](#while-loops) and [for…in](#forin-loops) loops, which have control criteria that can change across iterations.

In Pine v6, all [for](#for-loops) loops *dynamically* evaluate their stopping criteria before **each iteration**. Variables and expressions used as the `to_num` argument that depend on values or objects modified in the loop's scope can *update* the counter variable's boundaries across iterations. This behavior enables scripts to use a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop for iterative tasks where the exact iteration boundaries are unknown before the loop starts.

Because [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop boundaries can be *dynamic* in Pine v6, a v5 script using this loop structure with a mutated variable or dynamic expression such as `array.size(id) - 1` as the `to_num` argument can behave differently after conversion to v6.

**Fix:** If a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop requires only **one** evaluation of an expression used as the `to_num` argument across iterations, assign the expression to a variable *outside* the loop's scope, then use that variable as the `to_num` argument instead.

The following v5 example uses two [user-defined methods](#user-defined-methods) to manage the elements in an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_array). The script calls the `dequeue()` method before a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to remove the first element from the `data` array. Then, it calls the `queue()` method inside the loop statement to add the current bar's [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) into the array and return the [array's size](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.size) for the loop's end boundary. Within the loop's scope, the script increments the `belowCount` variable by one for each element with a value below the current bar's [ohlc4](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_ohlc4) value:

![image](images/To-pine-version-6-Dynamic-for-loop-boundaries-1.n43JfWKr_19ifCF.png)

```
//@version=5
indicator("v5 vs v6 `to_num` demo")

//@variable The size of the `data` array. 
int sizeInput = input.int(20, "Size", 1)

//@function Appends a new `value` to `this` array and returns the array's size. 
method queue(array<float> this, float value) =>
    this.push(value)
    this.size()

//@function Removes the first value from `this` array if the size equals the `sizeInput`.
method dequeue(array<float> this) =>
    if this.size() == sizeInput
        this.shift()

//@variable An array that holds `sizeInput` recent `close` prices. 
var array<float> data = array.new<float>()

//@variable The number of elements in the `data` array that are below the current bar's `ohlc4`. 
int belowCount = 0

// Remove the oldest element from the `data` array when its size reaches the `sizeInput`. 
data.dequeue()

// Push the bar's `close` into `data` and loop from zero to one less than the array's size. 
// In v5, the loop evaluates the `data.queue()` call *once*, meaning the final counter value is fixed across iterations.
// In v6, it evaluates the call before *every* iteration, causing the array and loop boundary to expand indefinitely.    
for i = 0 to data.queue(close) - 1
    // Add 1 to `belowCount` when the `data` element at index `i` is less than the `ohlc4` value. 
    if data.get(i) < ohlc4
        belowCount += 1

// Plot the `belowCount` in a separate pane. 
plot(belowCount, "Closes below OHLC4", color.blue, 3)
```

In v5, the above loop statement evaluates `data.queue(close) - 1` only **once**, before it starts the first iteration. It does *not* execute that expression again across iterations. As such, each script execution queues exactly one new value into the `data` array, and the number of times the loop executes its local code *does not change* while the loop runs.

However, the script does not work after conversion to v6, because the [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop evaluates `data.queue(close) - 1` before **every iteration**. Each evaluation of the expression adds a *new element* to the `data` array and *increases* the `to_num` boundary, causing the loop to iterate indefinitely until the script raises a runtime error:

![image](images/To-pine-version-6-Dynamic-for-loop-boundaries-2.XWLzv4MJ_Z1AU5wL.png)

We can fix the script's behavior by assigning the expression's initial result to a variable outside the loop's scope and using that variable in the [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop statement. This change prevents the expression from modifying the array's size or altering the loop's end boundary between iterations:

```
//@version=6
indicator("v5 to v6 fixed `to_num` demo")

//@variable The size of the `data` array. 
int sizeInput = input.int(20, "Size", 1)

//@function Appends a new `value` to `this` array and returns the array's size. 
method queue(array<float> this, float value) =>
    this.push(value)
    this.size()

//@function Removes the first value from `this` array if the size equals the `sizeInput`.
method dequeue(array<float> this) =>
    if this.size() == sizeInput
        this.shift()

//@variable An array that holds `sizeInput` recent `close` prices. 
var array<float> data = array.new<float>()

//@variable The number of elements in the `data` array that are below the current bar's `ohlc4`. 
int belowCount = 0

// Remove the oldest element from the `data` array when its size reaches the `sizeInput`. 
data.dequeue()

// Push the `close` into the `data` array and assign one less than the array's size to a variable, 
// ensuring only one evaluation per script execution. 
int lastCount = data.queue(close) - 1

// Use `lastCount` as the `to_num` in the `for` loop statement. 
// This change prevents the array and loop from expanding indefinitely, 
// because the value is calculated *outside* the loop's scope.
for i = 0 to lastCount
    // Add 1 to `belowCount` when the `data` element at index `i` is less than the `ohlc4` value. 
    if data.get(i) < ohlc4
        belowCount += 1

// Plot the `belowCount` in a separate pane. 
plot(belowCount, "Closes below OHLC4", color.blue, 3)
```

# [To Pine Script™ version 5](https://www.tradingview.com#to-pine-script-version-5)

## [Introduction](https://www.tradingview.com#introduction)

This guide documents the **changes** made to Pine Script from v4 to v5.
It will guide you in the adaptation of existing Pine scripts to Pine
Script v5. See our
[Release notes](#october-2021) for a list of the **new** features in Pine Script v5.

The most frequent adaptations required to convert older scripts to v5
are:

- Changing
  [study()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_study)
  for
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator)
  (the function's signature has not changed).
- Renaming built-in function calls to include their new namespace
  (e.g.,
  [highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_highest)
  in v4 becomes
  [ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dhighest)
  in v5).
- Restructuring inputs to use the more specialized `input.*()`
  functions.
- Eliminating uses of the deprecated `transp` parameter by using
  [color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dnew)
  to simultaneously define color and transparency for use with the
  `color` parameter.
- If you used the `resolution` and `resolution_gaps` parameters in
  v4's
  [study()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_study),
  they will require changing to `timeframe` and `timeframe_gaps` in
  v5's
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator).

## [v4 to v5 converter](https://www.tradingview.com#v4-to-v5-converter)

The Pine Editor can automatically convert v4 indicators and strategies to v5. The Pine converter is described in the [Overview](#pine-converter) page.

Not all scripts can be automatically converted from v4 to v5. If you
want to convert the script manually or if your indicator returns a
compilation error after conversion, use the following sections to
determine how to complete the conversion. A list of some errors you can
encounter during the automatic conversion and how to fix them can be
found in the
[Common script conversion errors](#common-script-conversion-errors) section of this guide.

## [Renamed functions and variables](https://www.tradingview.com#renamed-functions-and-variables)

For clarity and consistency, many built-in functions and variables were
renamed in v5. The inclusion of v4 function names in a new namespace is
the cause of most changes. For example, the
[sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_sma)
function in v4 is moved to the `ta.` namespace in v5:
[ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dsma).
Remembering the new namespaces is not necessary; if you type the older
name of a function without its namespace in the Editor and press the
'Auto-complete' hotkey (`Ctrl` +
`Space`, or `Cmd` on MacOS), a popup
showing matching suggestions appears:

![image](images/v5_autocomplete.R-4HP09V_Z1R3GAs.png)

Not counting functions moved to new namespaces, only two functions have
been renamed:

- `study()` is now
  [indicator()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator).
- `tickerid()` is now
  [ticker.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ticker%7Bdot%7Dnew).

The full list of renamed functions and variables can be found in the
[All variable, function, and parameter name changes](#all-variable-function-and-parameter-name-changes) section of this guide.

## [Renamed function parameters](https://www.tradingview.com#renamed-function-parameters)

The parameter names of some built-in functions were changed to improve
the nomenclature. This has no bearing on most scripts, but if you used
these parameter names when calling functions, they will require
adaptation. For example, we have standardized all mentions:

```
// Valid in v4. Not valid in v5.
timev4 = time(resolution = "1D")
// Valid in v5.
timev5 = time(timeframe = "1D")
// Valid in v4 and v5.
timeBoth = time("1D")
```

The full list of renamed function parameters can be found in the
[All variable, function, and parameter name changes](#all-variable-function-and-parameter-name-changes) section of this guide.

## [Removed an `rsi()` overload](https://www.tradingview.com#removed-an-rsi-overload)

In v4, the
[rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_rsi)
function had two different overloads:

- `rsi(series float, simple int)` for the normal RSI calculation, and
- `rsi(series float, series float)` for an overload used in the MFI
  indicator, which did a calculation equivalent to
  `100.0 - (100.0 / (1.0 + arg1 / arg2))`.

This caused a single built-in function to behave in two very different
ways, and it was difficult to distinguish which one applied because it
depended on the type of the second argument. As a result, a number of
indicators misused the function and were displaying incorrect results.
To avoid this, the second overload was removed in v5.

The
[ta.rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Drsi)
function in v5 only accepts a "simple int" argument for its `length`
parameter. If your v4 code used the now deprecated overload of the
function with a `float` second argument, you can replace the whole
`rsi()` call with the following formula, which is equivalent:

```
100.0 - (100.0 / (1.0 + arg1 / arg2))
```

Note that when your v4 code used a "series int" value as the second
argument to
[rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_rsi),
it was automatically cast to "series float" and the second overload of
the function was used. While this was syntactically correct, it most
probably did **not** yield the result you expected. In v5,
[ta.rsi()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Drsi)
requires a "simple int" for the argument to `length`, which precludes
dynamic (or "series") lengths. The reason for this is that RSI
calculations use the
[ta.rma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Drma)
moving average, which is similar to
[ta.ema()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta%7Bdot%7Dema)
in that it relies on a length-dependent recursive process using the
values of previous bars. This makes it impossible to achieve correct
results with a "series" length that could vary bar to bar.

If your v4 code used a length that was "const int", "input int" or
"simple int", no changes are required.

## [Reserved keywords](https://www.tradingview.com#reserved-keywords)

A number of words are reserved and cannot be used for variable or
function names. They are: `catch`, `class`, `do`, `ellipse`, `in`, `is`,
`polygon`, `range`, `return`, `struct`, `text`, `throw`, `try`. If your
v4 indicator uses any of these, rename your variable or function for the
script to work in v5.

## [Removed `iff()` and `offset()`](https://www.tradingview.com#removed-iff-and-offset)

The
[iff()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_iff)
and
[offset()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_offset)
functions have been removed. Code using the
[iff()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_iff)
function can be rewritten using the ternary operator:

```
// iff(<condition>, <return_when_true>, <return_when_false>)
// Valid in v4, not valid in v5
barColorIff = iff(close >= open, color.green, color.red)
// <condition> ? <return_when_true> : <return_when_false>
// Valid in v4 and v5
barColorTernary = close >= open ? color.green : color.red
```

Note that the ternary operator is evaluated "lazily"; only the
required value is calculated (depending on the condition's evaluation
to `true` or `false`). This is different from
[iff()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_iff),
which always evaluated both values but returned only the relevant one.

Some functions require evaluation on every bar to correctly calculate,
so you will need to make special provisions for these by pre-evaluating
them before the ternary:

```
// `iff()` in v4: `highest()` and `lowest()` are calculated on every bar
v1 = iff(close > open, highest(10), lowest(10)) 
plot(v1)
// In v5: forced evaluation on every bar prior to the ternary statement.
h1 = ta.highest(10)
l1 = ta.lowest(10)
v1 = close > open ? h1 : l1
plot(v1)
```

The
[offset()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_offset)
function was deprecated because the more readable
[[]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_%5B%5D)
operator is equivalent:

```
// Valid in v4. Not valid in v5.
prevClosev4 = offset(close, 1)
// Valid in v4 and v5.
prevClosev5 = close[1]
```

## [Split of `input()` into several functions](https://www.tradingview.com#split-of-input-into-several-functions)

The v4
[input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_input)
function was becoming crowded with a plethora of overloads and
parameters. We split its functionality into different functions to clear
that space and provide a more robust structure to accommodate the
additions planned for inputs. Each new function uses the name of the
`input.*` type of the v4 `input()` call it replaces. E.g., there is now
a specialized
[input.float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dfloat)
function replacing the v4 `input(1.0, type = input.float)` call. Note
that you can still use `input(1.0)` in v5, but because only
[input.float()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dfloat)
allows for parameters such as `minval`, `maxval`, etc., it is more
powerful. Also note that
[input.int()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dint)
is the only specialized input function that does not use its equivalent
v4 `input.integer` name. The `input.*` constants have been removed
because they were used as arguments for the `type` parameter, which was
deprecated.

To convert, for example, a v4 script using an input of type
`input.symbol`, the
[input.symbol()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsymbol)
function must be used in v5:

```
// Valid in v4. Not valid in v5.
aaplTicker = input("AAPL", type = input.symbol)
// Valid in v5
aaplTicker = input.symbol("AAPL")
```

The
[input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input)
function persists in v5, but in a simpler form, with less parameters. It
has the advantage of automatically detecting input types
"bool/color/int/float/string/source" from the argument used for
`defval`:

```
// Valid in v4 and v5.
// While "AAPL" is a valid symbol, it is only a string here because `input.symbol()` is not used.
tickerString = input("AAPL", title = "Ticker string")
```

## [Some function parameters now require built-in arguments](https://www.tradingview.com#some-function-parameters-now-require-built-in-arguments)

In v4, built-in constants such as `plot.style_area` used as arguments
when calling Pine Script functions corresponded to pre-defined values
of a specific type. For example, the value of `barmerge.lookahead_on`
was `true`, so you could use `true` instead of the named constant when
supplying an argument to the `lookahead` parameter in a
[security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_security)
function call. We found this to be a common source of confusion, which
caused unsuspecting programmers to produce code yielding unintended
results.

In v5, the use of correct built-in named constants as arguments to
function parameters requiring them is mandatory:

```
// Not valid in v5: `true` is used as an argument for `lookahead`.
request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close, lookahead = true)
// Valid in v5: uses a named constant instead of `true`.
request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)

// Would compile in v4 because `plot.style_columns` was equal to 5.
// Won't compile in v5.
a = 2 * plot.style_columns
plot(a)
```

To convert your script from v4 to v5, make sure you use the correct
named built-in constants as function arguments.

## [Deprecated the `transp` parameter](https://www.tradingview.com#deprecated-the-transp-parameter)

The `transp=` parameter used in the signature of many v4 plotting
functions was deprecated because it interfered with RGB functionality.
Transparency must now be specified along with the color as an argument
to parameters such as `color`, `textcolor`, etc. The
[color.new()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Dnew)
or
[color.rgb()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_color%7Bdot%7Drgb)
functions will be needed in those cases to join a color and its
transparency.

Note that in v4, the
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_bgcolor)
and
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_fill)
functions had an optional `transp` parameter that used a default value
of 90. This meant that the code below could display Bollinger Bands with
a semi-transparent fill between two bands and a semi-transparent
backround color where bands cross price, even though no argument is used
for the `transp` parameter in its
[bgcolor()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_bgcolor)
and
[fill()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_fill)
calls:

```
//@version=4
study("Bollinger Bands", overlay = true)
[middle, upper, lower] = bb(close, 5, 4)
plot(middle, color=color.blue)
p1PlotID = plot(upper, color=color.green)
p2PlotID = plot(lower, color=color.green)
crossUp = crossover(high, upper)
crossDn = crossunder(low, lower)
// Both `fill()` and `bgcolor()` have a default `transp` of 90
fill(p1PlotID, p2PlotID, color = color.green)
bgcolor(crossUp ? color.green : crossDn ? color.red : na)
```

In v5 we need to explictly mention the 90 transparency with the color,
yielding:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Bollinger Bands", overlay = true)
[middle, upper, lower] = ta.bb(close, 5, 4)
plot(middle, color=color.blue)
p1PlotID = plot(upper, color=color.green)
p2PlotID = plot(lower, color=color.green)
crossUp = ta.crossover(high, upper)
crossDn = ta.crossunder(low, lower)
var TRANSP = 90
// We use `color.new()` to explicitly pass transparency to both functions
fill(p1PlotID, p2PlotID, color = color.new(color.green, TRANSP))
bgcolor(crossUp ? color.new(color.green, TRANSP) : crossDn ? color.new(color.red, TRANSP) : na)
```

## [Changed the default session days for `time()` and `time_close()`](https://www.tradingview.com#changed-the-default-session-days-for-time-and-time_close)

The default set of days for `session` strings used in the
[time()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_time)
and
[time_close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_time_close)
functions, and returned by
[input.session()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input%7Bdot%7Dsession),
has changed from `"23456"` (Monday to Friday) to `"1234567"` (Sunday to
Saturday):

```
// On symbols that are traded during weekends, this will behave differently in v4 and v5.
t0 = time("1D", "1000-1200")
// v5 equivalent of the behavior of `t0` in v4.
t1 = time("1D", "1000-1200:23456")
// v5 equivalent of the behavior of `t0` in v5.
t2 = time("1D", "1000-1200:1234567")
```

This change in behavior should not have much impact on scripts running
on conventional markets that are closed during weekends. If it is
important for you to ensure your session definitions preserve their v4
behavior in v5 code, add `":23456"` to your session strings. See this
manual's page on [Sessions](#sessions) for more information.

## [`strategy.exit()` now must do something](https://www.tradingview.com#strategyexit-now-must-do-something)

Gone are the days when the
[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dexit)
function was allowed to loiter. Now it must actually have an effect on
the strategy by using at least one of the following parameters:
`profit`, `limit`, `loss`, `stop`, or one of the following pairs:
`trail_offset` combined with either `trail_price` or `trail_points`.
When uses of
[strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dexit)
not meeting these criteria trigger an error while converting a strategy
to v5, you can safely eliminate these lines, as they didn't do anything
in your code anyway.

## [Common script conversion errors](https://www.tradingview.com#common-script-conversion-errors)

### [Invalid argument 'style'/'linestyle' in 'plot'/'hline' call](https://www.tradingview.com#invalid-argument-stylelinestyle-in-plothline-call)

To make this work, you need to change the "int" arguments used for the
`style` and `linestyle` arguments in
[plot()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot)
and
[hline()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_hline)
for built-in constants:

```
// Will cause an error during conversion
plotStyle = input(1)
hlineStyle = input(1)
plot(close, style = plotStyle)
hline(100, linestyle = hlineStyle)

// Will work in v5
//@version=5
indicator("")
plotStyleInput = input.string("Line", options = ["Line", "Stepline", "Histogram", "Cross", "Area", "Columns", "Circles"])
hlineStyleInput = input.string("Solid", options = ["Solid", "Dashed", "Dotted"])

plotStyle = plotStyleInput == "Line" ? plot.style_line : 
      plotStyleInput == "Stepline" ? plot.style_stepline :
      plotStyleInput == "Histogram" ? plot.style_histogram :
      plotStyleInput == "Cross" ? plot.style_cross :
      plotStyleInput == "Area" ? plot.style_area :
      plotStyleInput == "Columns" ? plot.style_columns :
      plot.style_circles

hlineStyle = hlineStyleInput == "Solid" ? hline.style_solid :
      hlineStyleInput == "Dashed" ? hline.style_dashed :
      hline.style_dotted

plot(close, style = plotStyle)
hline(100, linestyle = hlineStyle)
```

See the
[Some function parameters now require built-in arguments](#some-function-parameters-now-require-built-in-arguments) section of this guide for more information.

### [Undeclared identifier 'input.%input_name%'](https://www.tradingview.com#undeclared-identifier-inputinput_name)

To fix this issue, remove the `input.*` constants from your code:

```
// Will cause an error during conversion
_integer = input.integer
_bool = input.bool
i1 = input(1, "Integer", _integer)
i2 = input(true, "Boolean", _bool)

// Will work in v5
i1 = input.int(1, "Integer")
i2 = input.bool(true, "Boolean")
```

See the User Manual's page on [Inputs](#inputs), and the
[Some function parameters now require built-in arguments](#some-function-parameters-now-require-built-in-arguments) section of this guide for more information.

### [Invalid argument 'when' in 'strategy.close' call](https://www.tradingview.com#invalid-argument-when-in-strategyclose-call)

This is caused by a confusion between
[strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dentry)
and
[strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclose).

The second parameter of
[strategy.close()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy%7Bdot%7Dclose)
is `when`, which expects a "bool" argument. In v4, it was allowed to
use `strategy.long` an argument because it was a "bool". With v5,
however, named built-in constants must be used as arguments, so
`strategy.long` is no longer allowed as an argument to the `when`
parameter.

The `strategy.close("Short", strategy.long)` call in this code is
equivalent to `strategy.close("Short")`, which is what must be used in
v5:

```
// Will cause an error during conversion
if (longCondition)
    strategy.close("Short", strategy.long)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)

// Will work in v5:
if (longCondition)
    strategy.close("Short")
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
```

See the
[Some function parameters now require built-in arguments](#some-function-parameters-now-require-built-in-arguments) section of this guide for more information.

### [Cannot call 'input.int' with argument 'minval'='%value%'. An argument of 'literal float' type was used but a 'const int' is expected](https://www.tradingview.com#cannot-call-inputint-with-argument-minvalvalue-an-argument-of-literal-float-type-was-used-but-a-const-int-is-expected)

In v4, it was possible to pass a "float" argument to `minval` when an
"int" value was being input. This is no longer possible in v5; "int"
values are required for "int" inputs:

```
// Works in v4, will break on conversion because minval is a 'float' value
int_input = input(1, "Integer", input.integer, minval = 1.0)

// Works in v5
int_input = input.int(1, "Integer", minval = 1)
```

#### To Pine Script™ version 6](#to-pine-version-6)[Next

#### To Pine Script™ version 4](#to-pine-version-4)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Migration guides](#overview)/To Pine Script™ version 4

# [To Pine Script™ version 4](https://www.tradingview.com#to-pine-script-version-4)

This is a guide to converting Pine Script code from `@version=3` to
`@version=4`.

## [Converter](https://www.tradingview.com#converter)

The Pine Editor can automatically convert v3 indicators and strategies to v4. The Pine converter is described in the [Overview](#pine-converter) page.

Not all scripts can be automatically converted from v3 to v4. If you
want to convert the script manually or if your indicator returns a
compilation error after conversion, consult the guide below for more
information.

## [Renaming of built-in constants, variables, and functions](https://www.tradingview.com#renaming-of-built-in-constants-variables-and-functions)

In Pine Script v4 the following built-in constants, variables, and
functions were renamed:

- Color constants (e.g `red`) are moved to the `color.*` namespace
  (e.g. `color.red`).
- The `color` function has been renamed to `color.new`.
- Constants for `input()` types (e.g. `integer`) are moved to the
  `input.*` namespace (e.g. `input.integer`).
- The plot style constants (e.g. `histogram` style) are moved to the
  `plot.style_*` namespace (e.g. `plot.style_histogram`).
- Style constants for the `hline` function (e.g. the `dotted` style)
  are moved to the `hline.style_*` namespace (e.g.
  `hline.style_dotted`).
- Constants of days of the week (e.g. `sunday`) are moved to the
  `dayofweek.*` namespace (e.g. `dayofweek.sunday`).
- The variables of the current chart timeframe (e.g. `period`,
  `isintraday`) are moved to the `timeframe.*` namespace (e.g.
  `timeframe.period`, `timeframe.isintraday`).
- The `interval` variable was renamed to `timeframe.multiplier`.
- The `ticker` and `tickerid` variables are renamed to
  `syminfo.ticker` and `syminfo.tickerid` respectively.
- The `n` variable that contains the bar index value has been renamed
  to `bar_index`.

The reason behind renaming all of the above was to structure the
standard language tools and make working with code easier. New names are
grouped according to assignments under common prefixes. For example, you
will see a list with all available color constants if you type 'color'
in the editor and press Ctrl + Space.

## [Explicit variable type declaration](https://www.tradingview.com#explicit-variable-type-declaration)

In Pine Script v4 it's no longer possible to create variables with an
unknown data type at the time of their declaration. This was done to
avoid a number of issues that arise when the variable type changes after
its initialization with the na value. From now on, you need to
explicitly specify their type using keywords or type functions (for
example, `float`) when declaring variables with the na value:

```
//@version=4
study("Green Candle Close")
// We expect `src` to hold float values, so we declare in with the `float` keyword
float src = na
if close > open
    src := close
plot(src)
```

[Previous

#### To Pine Script™ version 5](#to-pine-version-5)[Next

#### To Pine Script™ version 3](#to-pine-version-3)




[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Migration guides](#overview)/To Pine Script™ version 3

# [To Pine Script™ version 3](https://www.tradingview.com#to-pine-script-version-3)

This document helps to migrate Pine Script code from `@version=2` to
`@version=3`.

## [Default behaviour of security function has changed](https://www.tradingview.com#default-behaviour-of-security-function-has-changed)

Let's look at the simple `security` function use case. Add this
indicator on an intraday chart:

```
// Add this indicator on an intraday (e.g., 30 minutes) chart
//@version=2
study("My Script", overlay=true)
s = security(tickerid, 'D', high, false)
plot(s)
```

This indicator is calculated based on historical data and looks somewhat
*into the future*. At the first bar of every session an indicator plots
the high price of the entire day. This could be useful in some cases for
analysis, but doesn't work for backtesting strategies.

We worked on this and made changes in Pine Script version 3. If this
indicator is compiled with `//@version=3` directive, we get a completely
different picture: ![](images/V3.Dt4jGTcd_256NgY.png)

The old behaviour is still available though. We added a parameter to the
`security` function (the fifth one) called `lookahead`.

It can take on the form of two different values:
`barmerge.lookahead_off` (and this is the default for Pine Script
version 3) or `barmerge.lookahead_on` (which is the default for Pine
Script version 2).

## [Self-referenced variables are removed](https://www.tradingview.com#self-referenced-variables-are-removed)

Pine Script version 2 pieces of code, containing a self-referencing
variable:

```
//@version=2
//...
s = nz(s[1]) + close
```

Compiling this piece of code with Pine Script version 3 will give you
an `Undeclared identifier 's'` error. It should be rewritten as:

```
//@version=3
//...
s = 0.0
s := nz(s[1]) + close
```

`s` is now a *mutable variable* that is initialized at line 3. At line 3
the initial value gives the Pine Script compiler the information about
the variable type. It's a float in this example.

In some cases you may initialize that mutable variable (like `s`) with a
`na` value. But in complex cases that won't work.

## [Forward-referenced variables are removed](https://www.tradingview.com#forward-referenced-variables-are-removed)

```
//@version=2
//...
d = nz(f[1])
e = d + 1
f = e + close
```

In this example `f` is a forward-referencing variable, because it's
referenced at line 3 before it was declared and initialized. In Pine
Script version 3 this will give you an error
`Undeclared identifier 'f'`. This example should be rewritten in Pine
Script version 3 as follows:

```
//@version=3
//...
f = 0.0
d = nz(f[1])
e = d + 1
f := e + close
```

## [Resolving a problem with a mutable variable in a security expression](https://www.tradingview.com#resolving-a-problem-with-a-mutable-variable-in-a-security-expression)

When you migrate script to version 3 it's possible that after removing
self-referencing and forward-referencing variables the Pine Script
compiler will give you an error:

```
//@version=3
//...
s = 0.0
s := nz(s[1]) + close
t = security(tickerid, period, s)
```

`Cannot use mutable variable as an argument for security function!`

This limitation exists since mutable variables were introduced in Pine
Script, i.e., in version 2. It can be resolved as before: wrap the code
with a mutable variable in a function:

```
//@version=3
//...
calcS() =>
    s = 0.0
    s := nz(s[1]) + close
t = security(tickerid, period, calcS())
```

## [Math operations with booleans are forbidden](https://www.tradingview.com#math-operations-with-booleans-are-forbidden)

In Pine Script v2 there were rules of implicit conversion of booleans
into numeric types. In v3 this is forbidden. There is a conversion of
numeric types into booleans instead (0 and `na` values are `false`, all
the other numbers are `true`). Example (In v2 this code compiles fine):

```
//@version=2
study("My Script")
s = close >= open
s1 = close[1] >= open[1]
s2 = close[2] >= open[2]
sum = s + s1 + s2
col = sum == 1 ? white : sum == 2 ? blue : sum == 3 ? red : na
bgcolor(col)
```

Variables `s`, `s1` and `s2` are of *bool* type. But at line 6 we add
three of them and store the result in a variable `sum`. `sum` is a
number, since we cannot add booleans. Booleans were implicitly converted
to numbers (`true` values to `1.0` and `false` to `0.0`) and then they
were added.

This approach leads to unintentional errors in more complicated scripts.
That's why we no longer allow implicit conversion of booleans to
numbers.

If you try to compile this example as a Pine Script v3 code, you'll
get an error:
`Cannot call `operator +` with arguments (series__bool, series__bool); <...>`
It means that you cannot use the addition operator with boolean values.
To make this example work in Pine Script v3 you can do the following:

```
//@version=3
study("My Script")
bton(b) =>
    b ? 1 : 0
s = close >= open
s1 = close[1] >= open[1]
s2 = close[2] >= open[2]
sum = bton(s) + bton(s1) + bton(s2)
col = sum == 1 ? white : sum == 2 ? blue : sum == 3 ? red : na
bgcolor(col)
```

Function `bton` (abbreviation of boolean-to-number) explicitly converts
any boolean value to a number if you really need this.

[User Manual](#pine-script-docs)/[Migration guides](#overview)/To Pine Script™ version 2

# [To Pine Script™ version 2](https://www.tradingview.com#to-pine-script-version-2)

Pine Script version 2 is fully backwards compatible with version 1. As a result, all v1 scripts can be converted to v2 by adding the `//@version=2` annotation to them.

An example v1 script:

```
study("Simple Moving Average", shorttitle="SMA")
src = close
length = input(10)
plot(sma(src, length))
```

The converted v2 script:

```
//@version=2
study("Simple Moving Average", shorttitle="SMA")
src = close
length = input(10)
plot(sma(src, length))
```
